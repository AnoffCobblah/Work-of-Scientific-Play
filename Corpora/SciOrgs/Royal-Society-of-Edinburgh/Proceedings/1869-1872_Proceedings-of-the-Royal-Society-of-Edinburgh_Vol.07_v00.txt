2                   Proceedings  of the Royal Society
                      Monday, 6th December 1869.
         The Hon. Lord Neaves, Vice-President, read the
                         following Address: —
    I  have been deputed   by your President    to address  you to-night
from this chair, and so to attempt a task which would have been
much better performed by one who possesses             all the requisite
scientific acquirements which      I  want, and without which,    I fear,
justice can only be imperfectly done       to the work which     I have
 undertaken.
    It  is usual at this meeting to give some notice of those of our
 Members who have died during the preceding year, and the list on
 this occasion contains      so many, and some     of them such distin
 guished names, that it will leave me no space for touching on other
 topics.
    I  cannot mention the name of Dr James Begrie to an audience
 like the present without feeling that it recalls      to them pleasing
 remembrances and painful regrets connected with one who was so
 highly    esteemed among us as an eminent physician       and an excel
 lent man, and who, but a little while ago, seemed likely for some
 years to continue his course of usefulness and success.
    To myself the subject is specially calculated to communicate
 such feelings.      Dr Begbie was my early school-fellow and friend,
 and in that relation, and also in my resort to him as a medical
 attendant in whose anxiety and skill      I had  the utmost confidence,
 there were many years, more than half a century, of cordial inter
 course between us.
     Dr Begbie     was born in  Edinburgh in October      1789.  He was
 educated     at the High School and at the University of Edinburgh,
  and   early betook himself    to medical   studies.  According  to the
 system then established, but now       I  understand wholly or almost
 wholly discontinued, he became an apprentice with Dr Abercrombie,
 and was afterwards his assistant; in which capacity he had excellent
 opportunities of learning his profession, and of practically applying

                     of Edinburgh, Session       18(59-70.
his natural      talents and theoretical studies.     At this period,   too, he
showed      those kindly and amiable qualities for which he was after
wards    distinguished, and which gained him the affection both of
his   principal and of the pupils of Dr Abercrombie, with whom he
was brought in contact, and who in a great measure were placed
under his guidance and professional instruction.             Dr Begbie in his
turn became, under the system already noticed, the master of ap
prentices of his own, who regarded him with the same feelings,
and among whom were some              of the most esteemed       medical men
now among us.
    Dr Begbie, on relinquishing his connection with Dr Abercrombie,
became       engaged in an extensive practice as a family medical
attendant, and continued in that branch of the profession till about
twenty years ago, when he confined himself entirely to the func
tions of a consulting         physician, in which he was eminently         suc
cessful,      his assistance being extensively      resorted to both by his
 brethren     in Edinburgh and by practitioners throughout the country,
 who had confidence in his        skill, and in his solicitude  to do his duty
 to the   utmost.
     It is perhaps a remarkable circumstance that Dr Begbie, although
 he had      hospital experience during his studies, never acted as an
 Hospital Physician. It is not a little creditable to him that he
 should have been able otherwise to supply the want of those
 opportunities      from which he was thus excluded, and we should by
 no means be tempted to recommend a               similar experiment in the
 ordinary      case.    Dr Begbie, however, was specially enabled to
 supply any deficiency in this part of his professional career by
 the very extensive means of observation which were within his
 reach as the assistant of Dr Abercrombie,            for whom, to a great
 extent, he conducted those post-mortem examinations                and patho
 logical inquiries which were so intimately connected with Dr Aber-
 crombie's reputation       and  success,  particularly in certain   classes of
  diseases.
      We   are inclined  to think that in   some respects   Dr Begbie did not
  do   himself full justice.    He worked     too hard and    perhaps too ex
 clusively at his own profession;         he allowed    himself scarcely any
  time for relaxation, although he thoroughly enjoyed the too short
  intervals which he occasionally employed in this manner.              He  was

4                            Proceedings       of the Royal Society
fond of natural scenery, and particularly                            attached to the English
Lake country, and it would   have been better if he had indulged
his taste more in that direction.  We think, too, that in another
respect        he denied himself              some      enjoyments which              might    have
done him good.                    A certain   quietness,       if not   shyness,    of disposition
seemed          to     indispose       him    to much          social    intercourse,        and    he
seems not to have                  betaken    himself with any degree of interest to
extra professional pursuits.                       We hold that every hard-working
man is the better for a considerable amount of social recreation, and
for that relaxation which arises from the prosecution of collateral
pursuits.
         Though not much known                 as a    scientific man beyond the limits
of his profession, Dr Begbie distinguished                              himself, we believe, by
several         excellent          essays, both of a pathological               and    of a thera
peutical kind.                We must, of course, on this subject speak entirely
from hearsay;                but we understand it is generally considered that
his volume of " Contributions                          to Practical       Medicine
                                                                                       " contains
much that is valuable and original.                            His    essays   on   Fatty Degen
eration of the Heart, and on Ansemia and its consequences,                                         have
been specially mentioned to me as having excited great attention,
    and obtained        much praise.
         In   one position          which he occupied Dr Begbie was very promi
    nently useful, and deserves to be specially pointed out for general
    imitation.         I refer     to the office which for nearly forty years he held
    as   medical adviser to the Scottish Widows' Fund Assurance Office.
    In saying this,           I   do not wish to give him any preference                     over his
    brethren          who,    among ourselves,           hold similar          situations.         That
    would not only be invidious,                   but utterly unjust; for             I know      that
    all the Edinburgh               offices, and   I   have     no doubt the Scottish offices
    generally,         are    in this respect          aided    by advisers of the greatest
    skill, assiduity, and conscientiousness. But the Scottish Widows'
    Fund          believe, our oldest Edinburgh office, and certainly one
                is,
                 I
    of our most prosperous, and        cannot resist this opportunity of
                                                I
    saying, without               disparaging      the merits and services            of   officers   of
    another class in such institutions,                    that the character and conduct
    of their medical adviser must always be of the utmost importance
    to their prosperity.               Some recent occurrences             have opened our eyes
    to   a    danger that we were apt to forget, that those who profess to

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1869-70.
give security      to others, may not be themselves secure.                   As the
epigram says,
                " Payment of premiums will but      make you poorer,
                  Unless you're very sure of your insurer."
 And certainly there          can   be    no disappointment        more    cruel, no
 injustice more culpable, than that which takes from hard-working
 men    of business    a share   of their annual earnings          on the faith     of
 providing     for their families,        and  then at the     end     leaves   those
 families unprovided for.
     Now,   one  of the best guarantees for the success and solvency of an
 insurance office is to be found in the skill and fidelity of the medical
 officer.    It is by testing carefully the value of the lives proposed
 for insurance that the        office   is enabled    to meet    its engagements
 and realise its profits;      for one great source of profit must be that
 the lives insured      are  in  one sense picked lives, so that they shall
 not    be more    hazardous, but rather less so, than the average                rate
 of life on which the tables            are framed;      and that     if  any extra
  hazard is run, it shall be compensated by a corresponding extra
  payment.       The medical duty thus to         be discharged is not an easy
  one, and is beset by many difficulties and snares.               It  is not always
  easy to detect the seeds of latent disease, even when the person
  insured is presented to the medical officer; and it is still more
  difficult when the judgment            is to be formed at second-hand from
  information     that may be careless, inaccurate, or even treacherous,
  and where the utmost           vigilance     and acuteness       are required in
  order to detect any concealed flaw.            On the other hand, it is not
   right that lives,     even   of  a doubtful     kind,   should altogether be
  excluded from the benefit of insurance,                and still less that the
  medical     officer   should     reject     any   from    ignorance       or   rash
   ness.
      The task thus devolving         on   Dr Begbie for the important Society
   to which    he was attached was discharged              by him in a manner
   highly satisfactory to his constituents,            and  tending, there is no
   doubt, to aid in achieving          for that society the great and growing
   success which     has   attended it.       Dr Begbie's septennial papers on
   the causes   of death in    the   records of that society were extremely
   interesting,   and,   I  believe, very instructive.         It   is a great satis
   faction to his friends, and to those interested in that institution,

6                  Proceedings          of the Royal Society
that his place     is now filled by a son who is every way worthy to
succeed him.
    I shall note    here   some      dates   of the principal   incidents of   Dr
Begbie's professional         life,   and add    also from the      " Edinburgh
                      "
Medical Journal          some account of his last illness.
    Dr Begbie graduated in medicine in               1821 in the University of
Edinburgh.       In   1822     he    was elected    Fellow of the College of
Surgeons, and at this time entered on the duties of private medical
practice.     In  1847, having         become    much engaged      in consulting
practice, he joined the College of Physicians             as a Fellow.    Of that
 College he was President in 1854-56, and discharged the duties                 of
the office with   ability, dignity, and grace.           For  a few   years  after
the   institution of the office, he acted as          one of the Examiners in
Medicine in the University.               During 1850-52 he was President
of the Medico-Chirurgical Soeiety. For several years he was
Physician in Ordinary to the Queen in Scotland.
    The illness which led to his death began in the                 end of 1868
from exposure to cold, which gave rise to an attack of pneumonia.
This    was got under, but he returned too soon to his duties, and
again became       ill from      some     long journeys    which he made.       It
was then seen that his health was seriously impaired.                 He suffered
much from breathlessness,            and the action of the heart became em
barrassed.      A change of air and        scene was tried without success, and
on his returning      home his symptoms became more violent, and his
strength declined.        The immediate        cause of his death was pulmon
 ary congestion.       But   he remained conscious and collected to the
 last, enduring much suffering with great patience, and looking for
ward to his end without             fear and with a well-founded         religious
confidence.      He died     on the 26th of August 1869.
    William Brand, another of our departed                  members,    was born
 in  1807, in the parish of Peterhead, and received his early educa
 tion in that parish.      After serving       an apprenticeship    in Peterhead
with the respectable gentlemen who were factors for the Merchant
 Maiden Hospital of Edinburgh in that place, he came to this city,
 about the year 1829,           and    served   a second    apprenticeship    with
 Messrs Scott, Findlay, and Balderston, W.S., of which firm, after
 himself entering       as a  Writer     to the Signet, he became a partner.

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1869-70.                                          7
lie   was    an     excellent      man    of business, of great intelligence, accu
racy, and integrity           ;    and    his high character in this respect led
to his appointment,               in 1846, to the secretaryship of the Union
Bank of Scotland, a situation                 which         he filled       with great useful
ness and universal             approbation until his death.                    His knowledge
of financial affairs, his readiness                  to     oblige       and assist wherever
his services were desired, and his great courtesy and frankness,
made       him most acceptable to his constituents and their customers,
as well as to        all who      came in contact with him.
      Mr Brand's love of science early took the direction of                         a decided
taste for botany, and               he was one of the               original    members     who
founded the Botanical               Society of Edinburgh.                   Of that Society   he
continued         all along       to be a most valuable member, contributing
mauy excellent communications                   to    it,    and enriching its herbarium
with many thousand specimens of interesting                               plants, collected by
him and by his friends in the course of their numerous botanical
excursions, on which               he always entered with                   great enthusiasm,
uud for which he was admirably                  adapted             by   his active habits and
buoyant spirits,          and      by his readiness           to    bear,    and even     enjoy,
the     little hardships           and    inconveniences            which such excursions
sometimes involve.                 The spoils with which these excursionists
 returned were given to the                Society, partly for distribution,              partly
 for preservation, and             were    of no small             importance     in fostering
 iind diffusing       a   taste    for botany and         a   knowledge         of the Scottish
 flora.
      Some months before his death               Mr Brand's health               began to   fail;
 and    although       at first no serious alarm was felt as to his case, he
 at last sank rapidly and unexpectedly,                            and died on        the 18th
 October last, having completed his sixty-second year.
      Mr Brand       was well known as an active member                        of the Episcopal
 Church       of Scotland.  He died deeply lamented by his relatives
 and       friends, and amidst the general respect and regret of the
 community, for his excellent qualities and exemplary character.
      Dr   Allen Dalzell,           an able and amiable member of our Society,
 was born      in    1821 at Madras, where his father held the position                         of
 Postmaster- General.          Like most children of European parents, he
early came          to this country and resided with his mother in Bum

8                  Proceedings of        the  Royal Society
fries, where his preliminary       education was mainly carried on.                  He
served for some      years, first in the navy and then in the army, and
saw a good      deal of actual warfare         ;   but in 1846         he resolved    to
change his profession, and, having commenced with great ardour
the study of medicine, he took the degree                 of Doctor of Medicine
at the University here with high distinction.                  While yet a student
he had rendered great assistance to Professor William Gregory in
his researches as to creatine and the products obtained from uric
acid, and he received from that eminent chemist a special certificate
of having exhibited        much original       research,      while he obtained       at
the same time from the Senatus a remission                  of one    Annus Medicus
of the usual medical curriculum.                 In    1853,    at   the time of     his
graduation, he obtained the gold medal of the University of Edin
burgh for a series of extended researches                  on physiology,       and   in
December of that year he was appointed by Professor Gregory his
class and laboratory assistant, with the duty                 of teaching the class
of Practical Chemistry.          During the winter preceding the Pro
fessor's  death,    when he      was laid aside by illness, Dr Dalzell
supplied    his   place   in the     chemical        class,   and was      afterwards
appointed by Dr Lyon Playfair, Dr Gregory's                        successor,   to  the
same duties of conducting           the practical laboratory which he had
formerly    discharged.       His connection with             the    University con
tinued to the last, with these additional labours, that in 1859 he
delivered in the New College, Edinburgh, a six months' course on
Natural Science, and succeeded the late Dr George Wilson in the
Chair of Chemistry         and Materia       Medica in the Royal Veterinary
College,    which    office   he  filled    for many         years with       credit to
himself   and    benefit to his pupils.        He     was also      in much request,
and much esteemed         as a popular lecturer on scientific subjects                in
various institutions     in England       as well as in         Scotland.      He was
possessed of decided        talents, and,     with      much professional        infor
mation, he had great refinement and elevation of character;                         and
h is frank, affectionate, and generous disposition secured the attach
ment of all who knew him.           With his quick feelings             and impulsive
disposition, it is possible that his health, already affected by over
work, may have been further injured               by an unpleasant lawsuit in
connection     with   his official position         in the Veterinary          College.
An erroneous verdict          was returned        against him, but which,            on

                      of Edinburgh,     Session 1869-70.                        9
an appeal to the Court, was set aside, and a verdict in Lis favour
unanimously      given by a second jury.
   His health    was for some      time delicate, and it was found that he
had severe disease        of the heart.    He died    on the 29th    July  1869,
after an illness of much suffering, home with pious and exemplary
patience.     His removal, thus occurring in the prime of life,         was  felt
as a great loss and a severe affliction by his relatives and friends.
   Dr Robert Dtcb         was the eldest son    of the late  Dr William Dyce,
an eminent       physician     in Aberdeen.       He was born in November
1798, and was the eldest of a family of sixteen, of whom the late
eminent artist, Mr William Dyce. was one. He took his degree of
M.A.   at Marischal College in 1816, and afterwards studied medicine
at Aberdeen, Edinburgh,          and London.       After being for    some time
attached to the Military Hospital at Chatham, he went out, in 1821,
on   a staff    appointment       to the Mauritius.          There   he  became
extremely popular with           the   English residents,      from   whom    he
declined    to take fees for medical           attendance, but who eagerly
showed their gratitude by valuable presents.                 He  was afterwards
transferred    to the Cape,       where   he   remained for five years, and
married the daughter of a gentleman holding a high official posi
tion there.          He returned to England in             1833,   and spent    a
 winter in Aberdeen, after which he accepted               a staff appointment
at Maidstone      ;   but  in 1836,   on  the death     of his father,    he was
 induced to settle in his native town, where                he succeeded   to an
 extensive practice and to valuable appointments.               In 1860, on the
union of the two Colleges at Aberdeen into one University,                he was
appointed     to    the   Professorship  of Midwifery,        then established,
 having previously        held   a college   lectureship on that branch of
science   for nearly twenty years.
    Both as a lecturer and as a practitioner           in his special depart
 ment he was looked up to as a high authority            ;  and to his students,
 as well as to all who came         in contact with him, he recommended
 himself by his kind and courteous manners, and his high principles
 and  honourable feelings, which were in every respect those of a
 thorough gentleman. His medical assistance to the poor was given
 gratuitously, with unremitting and unostentatious liberality.                He
was an accomplished man, well acquainted with several import-
    vol. vn.                                                            B

tunities of studying at the Mauritius and at the Cape ; and he had
made extensive collections of specimens, some of which were of
great value.    Though not     an artist,      like his distinguished    brother,
he had a great love of art, and a fine and critical taste in painting.
   He  had been    ailing for some     little time   before bis death, but had
not felt any serious alarm about his case.           At last, however,   he came
to  Edinburgh for medical        advice,     when it was found that he had
acute inflammation of the lungs.            It  was hoped that    it might easily
be subdued; but the disease suddenly took an unfavourable turn, and
he died in Edinburgh,      11th January 1869, in his seventy -first year.
    Among    our Honorary Members              whom we have       lost I  have to
notice the eminent physiologist M. Flourens, lately deceased.                 He
is well known among us, both by his reputation and by his works ;
and notices of the principal events of his life are to be found in
the usual books       of contemporary biography.             I  am sorry that    I
have   been unable to ascertain any particulars               as to the cause or
circumstances of his death,       a  matter which, in his case, and in con
nection with his own        speculations, might        be  thought to possess a
 special interest.
    He  was born in the district of Herault, in France, in 1794, and
 early devoted   himself to medical science, and particularly to phy
 siology and biology.      He  made various researches and experiments
 on the nervous system, and          on the several functions of the great
 sources of nervous power      ;  and his countrymen consider that the
 disclosures thus made by him, preceding, as they did, the pro
 mulgation of the discoveries of Sir Charles Bell, entitle him to high
 praise, and form the best foundation of his scientific reputation.
 He published     a variety of works on other cognate subjects from
 time to time, one of the most remarkable of these being upon
 "Longevity,   and the amount of life diffused over the globe," in which
 he vindicated     for man the period of 100             years as the normal
 duration of his existence under favourable circumstances.                     He
 was elected   a member of the Academy of Sciences,                  of which   he
 afterwards became       one of     the secretaries.        He   was also   after
 wards elected     a  member     of the Academie Francaise, and had
 numerous other honours conferred upon him, both scientific and

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1869-70.                                       11
political.      But    he seems      to    have valued his scientific                 position
above    all adventitious        dignities.         At his death      he had          attained
his seventy-fifth      year, which        might     be generally      thought a pretty
fair allowance        of life;      but from our ignorance             of facts         above
alluded to, we are unable to say whether this, in his view,                       a, prema
ture termination          of his existence, is or          is not a confirmation            of
his own theory on the subject.
   There is no member of the Royal Society                          of whom       we have
occasion     to lament      the death, and to cherish the memory, more
than Principal         Forbes, who was for           so   long    a period our        faithful
and efficient Secretary.           It will    not be easy to do justice to the
merits of one who had so many claims upon our gratitude                                   and
regard, and who reflected so much honour on every public                              institu
tion with which he was connected.
  James David Forbes was born at Edinburgh, on the 20th of
April 1809, and was the son of Sir William Forbes, of Pitsligo,
Bart. The death of his mother in the year after his birth, and the
delicacy of constitution           which proved fatal to her, made his father
feel anxious about the boy's health             ;    and as he grew up, his slender
frame, and almost premature intellectual                      development, seemed to
indicate      that    his education       should     be    conducted     with     caution,
and  limited, in the first instance, to the simplest and most essential
subjects.   It is remarkable, that it was thought necessary, on this
ground, to prohibit strictly his study of mathematics; and it was
only at spare moments, and almost by stealth, that he acquired a
branch       of knowledge intimately connected with the pursuits in
                              so
which he was afterwards destined to excel.    His preliminary edu
cation was chiefly domestic, but in due time he attended several of
the classes    of the Edinburgh University.                    On leaving       it,   he has
told us that geology, meteorology, and physics were his favourite
pursuits;and he then began those excursions at home and abroad
which were to him all his life so great  source of pleasure and
                                                          a
scientific improvement.            While
                                       still  youth his father had
                                             he was           a
occasion to spend two successive winters in Italy, whither he took
his son with him      ;   aud young Forties's          natural     taste for investiga
tion led him to make frequent visits to Vesuvius and the celebrated
Pillars of Serapis.  His mind was strongly moved by what be

12                   Proceedings      of the Royal Society
there saw     ;   and   in 1827,    when eighteen years of age, his first
scientific   papers     appeared    in Dr Brewster's Journal, but without
his name.         Two other papers from him, on the natural features of
the same region, appeared in the same journal, also anonymously,
but with the signature          "Delta;"     and from that time forward he
continued to be a regular contributor to that publication in com
munications which were avowed.
    In   1830,     in compliance      with his father's wishes,         Mr Forbes
passed advocate at the Scottish             bar, and    walked the boards for      a
short time      ;  but his heart was not there, and it would have been
vain to confine his buoyant spirit and active frame to the close
discipline      of that profession, when it was in his power to indulge
his tastes      and   faculties in the pursuit         of physical     science and
geological       exploration.    He    soon   afterwards resolved to quit the
law, and rejoiced in the change he had thus made.                     At this time
he visited      Switzerland,    and   imbibed that interest in the subject of
the glacier formations which afterwards stimulated so much of his
exertions, both as an explorer and as            a  scientific author.
   In 1833,      on returning from the Continent, he found that the           Chair
of Natural Philosophy had become vacant by the death of Professor
 Leslie,and that Forbes's friends had put him in nomination as a candi
date.   It was    a painful position for him to occupy when his competitor
 was   Sir David, then Dr Brewster, who had              been among his earliest
 scientific friends, and who had fostered and encouraged his talents
 by the kindest sympathy and assistance.                  It  was a keen contest,
 and the friends of Brewster might naturally                feel indignant   that so
 young a man should           be preferred to one of such           high eminence
 and long standing as Brewster had attained to.                    This preference
 was imputed        entirely   to political    feeling   or   local influence,   and
 these    undoubtedly       entered largely      into   the question.       But the
 supporters of Forbes were no false prophets when they predicted
 for their candidate a long career           of ardent exertion and eminent
 success,    not only as a scientific         inquirer,    but as a lecturer     and
  teacher  ;    and as to his youth,     it  was pointed      out that Maclaurin,
 Dugald Stewart, and other eminent professors,                   were  appointed at
  as early an age, or earlier.         The appointment, ultimately,          had  all
  the justification      which the event could supply.            Professor Forbes
  occupied    the Chair of Natural        Philosophy     for more than     a quarter

                    of Edinburgh,        Session 1869-70.                           13
of a century, with the utmost honour to himself and the University
to which   he belonged.       It   is creditable to both parties,          and more
especially  so to Sir     David Brewster, that the contest which thus
terminated      did  not dissolve       their   friendship,    or   prevent their
cordial  co-operation in everything that could promote the interests
of science.
    For a long series of summers          Professor Forbes resorted to Swit
zerland and to other districts of alpine scenery in Europe, and thus
matured    those profound and important views which he promulgated
on geological and other questious — in particular, on the subject of
glaciers.    It  is quite unnecessary,      and would    be  very presumptuous
on my part. to attempt any account or criticism                   of his works or
researches,    and indeed everything that could be desired                has in this
respect, so far as geology is concerned,          been excellently done by our
friend  Mr Geikie, in     the   minute and kindly memoir of Principal
Forbes which he lately read to the Geological Society.                 Appended to
that memoir will     be found a correct and complete list,          as  I believe, of
Principal Forbes' scientific writings, and the catalogue of our own
library will supply similar information.              I may shortly say, that
Principal    Forbes   was an  ardent     geologist  — that  from an early period
he   had been imbued with the enthusiasm for that branch of science
which prevailed among scientific men in Edinburgh                        in the first
quarter    of the present        century, and       that   he earnestly desired
 to see a school of geology        fully revived    and established among us.
    Principal Forbes, it is     somewhat       singular to observe, had on the
 motion of Dr Brewster          been      admitted a member           of the Royal
Society before he had attained his twenty-first                year.       The Keith
 Prize  was twice awarded         to him by the Council.           In  1846, on the
 death of Sir John         Robison,      he   was appointed to the           office  of
 Secretary of this Society, and for about twenty years thereafter he
 discharged the duties of the appointment with the most efficient
 assiduity    and   the  most    conscientious diligence.            His    desire   to
 maintain     the usefulness and the dignity            of the Society, and to
 preserve ite ranks and its discussions free from anything that was
 unworthy of a scientific body, and the pains that he took in pro
 curing and preparing for publication             the compositions which con
stitute its " Transactions," and on which its character and reputa
 tion will in a great measure permanently depend, were beyond all

 14                 Proceedings        of the Royal Society
praise,  and   were    both   proved     and   rewarded by the        condition     in
which he maintained          the Society while he was Secretary, and in
which he left it when he resigned that office
   On occasion     of his giving up the        office   of Secretary, the Royal
Society recorded the expression             of their sense       of his valuable
services in the following resolution : — " That the Royal Society
deeply laments that a necessity has arisen for the retirement of
Principal Forbes from        office as General Secretary.          That it desires
now to record      in its minutes its grateful sense of the obligation
under which it lies to Principal Forbes for the zeal and ability with
which he has acted as its Secretary for the last twenty years,                    for
the many important         discoveries and inquiries        in science which he
has brought      before   its meetings, and for the eminent degree                 in
which his exertions and example have contributed                     to its present
prosperity   ; and that, as a mark of the regard in which he has been
long held, alike     as an   office-bearer and as a cultivator          of physical
science,  he be requested      to sit to an eminent        artist for his portrait,
to be hung in the Society's apartments."
   On the removal of Sir David Brewster to the headship of the
University of Edinburgh, Professor Forbes was chosen Principal
of the United College of St Salvator and St Leonard in the Univer
sity of St Andrews.         His failing health, which, there           can be  little
doubt, had suffered much from excessive exertions in his mountain
excursions, and perhaps also from overstrained labour in some of
his scientific    researches,    made     the retreat thus offered        to him a
welcome refuge from the task of daily lectures to which he had be
come quite unequal.         For   a time after his removal to the retirement
of St Andrews,        he seemed       to be  rallying in strength, with the
assistance of his annual residence in the pure air and amidst the
interesting    scenery of Perthshire,         but the improvement           did not
continue, and his old ailment of haemorrhage from the lungs returned
with alarming       violence.      He left St Andrews         and   removed     to a
milder climate,      stopping ultimately        at  Clifton, where he died on
the 31st of December 1868.              We   are   told that " whilst his body
was reduced to the last stage of weakness,              his mind remained self-
controlled, unclouded, and peaceful to the end."                 His activity and
usefulness in his office of Principal of St Andrews University have
been borne     witness to, and a truthful        and touching      tribute paid to

                       of Edinburgh, Stusimi         18(59-70.                 15
  his memory, in the address           lately delivered by his excellent and
 accomplished successor Principal Shairp.
     Principal Forbes      had a certain reserve and apparent dryness of
 manner,     but  he had   a kind and noble heart, an unremitting zeal for
 the promotion of science, a conscientious desire to discharge every
 duty, an ardent love of truth, and a strong detestation of injustice.
 He was not unmindful of what he felt to be his own claims, but he
 also fought many a battle in vindication of what he considered to
 be due to others.
     The late Master of      the  Mint will    be readily enrolled by all who
 knew him, or who know what he has done, as another among the
 great names that Scotland can boast of in chemical science.
    Thomas Graham was born at Glasgow, on the 21st December 1805,
 and after passing through the usual course            of preliminary study in
 that city, he entered the University of Glasgow in 1819.               He early
 showed    a  strong taste for science, and a decided bias for chemistry
 as a  pursuit.     His father, it is believed, wished him to enter the
 Scotch Church       ;  but Graham        felt that his true vocation lay in
 another direction,       and his desire of penetrating          the secrets   of
 natural knowledge was too strong to be repressed.              Thomas Thom
 son was    then Professor of Chemistry in Glasgow University,             and  it
 cannot be doubted that from his instruction Graham derived great
 benefit,  and received a strong confirmation of his natural tastes in
 that direction.        After    graduating     at Glasgow,     he   repaired to
 Edinburgh, and studied for two years under Dr Hope, who, if not
distinguished by powers of original discovery, was an able and ele
gant expositor of the discoveries of others, and most successful in
conducting      the experiments by which his lectures were illustrated.
Graham       at this time also made           the acquaintance     of Professor
Leslie,    a man      of undoubted originality and of most diversified
knowledge, and with whom it was impossible to associate without
being stimulated to intellectual exertion and scientific inquiry.
    It  is probable that, during the time when he was engaged              in his
 University studies, both in Glasgow and Edinburgh,                 he was sub
jected to much         anxiety as to his prospects, and as to the proba
bility of his being       able to   justify, by  success, the choice which he
had made of a position            in life, which    could scarcely be said     to

  1G                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
  amount to a profession, and which, at that time in particular, pro
  mised few and scanty rewards for the efforts and sacrifices which               it
 involved.     In  these trials    it would   appear    that Graham was com
 forted and supported by the sympathy and affection of an excellent
 mother, with whom, when he was absent, he regularly corresponded,
 and to whom he confided his most intimate and anxious feelings.
    In  such circumstances,      it must    have been a source       of pride and
 satisfaction to him that, in 1829, when scarcely twenty-four years               of
 age, he was     appointed     Lecturer on Chemistry at the Mechanics'
 Institution, Glasgow, and in 1830 Professor of Chemistry at the
 Andersonian Institution, an event of which his mother just sur
 vived to hear.
    In  1837 he was appointed Professor of Chemistry              in the London
 University,    and remained      in that appointment till the year 1855.
 During the five and twenty years for which he thus occupied a
 professorial chair, first in Glasgow and then in London, Graham
 found himself in that position which was the one he would himself
 probably have selected        as    the best for carrying on his favourite
 plans of scientific investigation;         and that long period was accord
 ingly  devoted to the assiduous prosecution of his great object, in
 the course of which his enthusiastic          researches    were    rewarded by
 numerous important discoveries, which are not only in themselves
 valuable, but which must ever deserve the attention of chemical
 students, as examples of that assiduous application and persevering
 inquiry by which        alone the hidden         truths    of nature       can  be
 brought to   light.
    It is quite beyond my power to give any detailed account                 of Mr
 Graham's discoveries, or to make a just estimate of their value in a
science with which, in its rapidly           advancing and ever expanding
state,  I am   so imperfectly    acquainted    ; but  I believe the statements
on   the subject which        lately     appeared    in   the new periodical,
" Nature," may       be relied on as accurate and       just; and     I have   been
furnished from a high         authority     with some materials as to these
points, which      I  shall endeavour here to embody to the best                 of
my ability.
   Graham's tendency to the             prosecution of      scientific   discovery
showed itself while he was             yet a  pupil of     Professor     Thomson
in Glasgow.       He made some suggestions to that Professor                  as to

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1869-70.                                  17
the possibility    of water playing          an important     part in     the     con
stitution   of acids and         salts.     The Professor     was struck      by the
ideas   of bis young pupil,        and    encouraged him to continue his in
vestigations    on the subject.          This ultimately led to his splendid
researches in phosphoric acid, as to which he shows                 that its three
varieties —common        phosphoric acid, pyrophosphoric acid, and meta-
phosphoric     acid — differed only by containing           a different     number
of atoms of     water,    chemically combined with the an-hydride.                  He
followed    this inquiry up by researches on water in sails, and
showed that in a salt the different numbers are held with dif
ferent degrees of tenacity.             His attention   was early attracted to
the diffusion of gases.          The manner in which        gases  mix with      each
other,   and the permanence with which the intermixture                    is main
tained, are remarkably         different from what is experienced             in the
case of liquids    ;  and    it is probably      to this fact that we owe          the
stability of   the   proportions in which the ingredients of the atmo
sphere are maintained, a uniformity             which is so essential to organic
life.   The laws     also   according      to which    gaseous   diffusion      takes
place were found by Graham to               be  based upon mathematical rela
tions between their density and their velocity of diffusion, which
 were   at once   interesting      and    unexpected.      The laws     as to      the
effusion of gases into a vacuum, and their transpiration                   through
 narrow tubes, were also traced by him with indefatigable                 diligence
and complete success; and it is a fact of which we may be proud,
 that his first paper    on that subject was read           before   this Society.
 The importance of         these    investigations,    particularly    in connec
 tion  with the phenomena of osmosis, will probably be seen, in
 its full extent, in the clue which they seem to give to some of
 the most remarkable           facts in     physiology.      The discoveries of
 Dr Graham       were    due mainly,         it  may    be   said, to    his     close
 adherence to any subject on which he once                  entered.      He never
 quitted   it until, by steadfast attention, deliberate consideration,
 and varied experiment, he had extracted out of it every atom
 of scientific truth which it was capable of yielding.              The secret of
 his success   in this respect was probably not different               from what
 may be seen in other eminent              discoverers.    Newlon     ascribed      bis
 achievements not to genius, but to earnest and unremitting                    atten
 tion; and it must      be manifest       bow much more likely it          is  that a
    vol. vn.                                                               u

18                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
new truth should dawn upon the mind                   which has been long and
intently occupied with          a subject     than that it should       be  the  fruit
of a casual and transient consideration.               It was by this habit and
faculty of perseverance that Graham was enabled to do what he
did  ; it  was to this that we owe         all that   he has taught us as to       the
diffusion    of   gases   and   liquids,   as well    as his last and      crowning
discovery as to the nature         of hydrogen, of which, perhaps, the full
effect is not yet     fully  seen or recognised.
    At  an early stage of his inquiries            as to hydrogen, he had seen
that it was isomeric with some of the metals, but his later experi
ments went further still towards establishing the metallic character
of that gas.       He  showed that certain metals — palladium,            platinum,
and iron — can, under certain circumstances,                 absorb    considerable
quantities     of hydrogen               This   he termed the       " Occlusion     of
                                 gas.
Hydrogen       Gas."     Latterly, his investigations          were   made    almost
exclusively with palladium, which absorbs                 a much larger propor
tion of hydrogen than any other metal.                  The method      he pursued
 was to decompose         water by    a  galvanic    battery, the negative elec
trode, at which the hydrogen is liberated, being formed of a plate                  or
wire of palladium.          In  this arrangement, when the decomposition
takes place, oxygen is given off copiously at the positive electrode,
 but no hydrogen, or very little, appears at the negative in the first
instance, the avidity of the palladium for oxygen requiring that                     it
should first be saturated with              that    substance,   after which       the
 hydrogen begins to be given off.               In this way Graham succeeded
in charging palladium with            a quantity     of hydrogen, which, in the
 form of gas, would occupy             900   times the volume of palladium.
 The    palladium     so charged       retains    its metallic   appearance,      and
 differs from pure palladium,           very much as a metal containing               a
 small quantity of metallic alloy differs from the pure metal.                  From
 these    facts, Graham      inferred that hydrogen in its solid state was
 truly metallic, and to this substance, according to the usual ana
 lysis of chemical nomenclature, the name of hydrogenium was
 given, and a medal of palladium and hydrogenium in the alloyed
 state was struck in honour of the discovery.               Another of his recent
 discoveries is said       to have been       that, while    the gas shut up         in
 terrestrial    iron is carbonic oxide,         the gas contained       in meteoric
 iron is hydrogen.

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1869-70.                                L9
    Prior, I believe, to       the year 1850 the Mastership         of the  Mint   had
for a long time been           a political    office,   the occupant of which was
removable with the ministry with whom he was associated.                          The
individual who held it was, in this way, not a man of science, but
a  statesman of general intelligence and business habits, whose
duty it was to superintend and keep to their tasks the permanent
officials by whom the work                was understood and        performed.      In
1850 a change was made               in this respect, and apparently a change
for the better.        It  was determined         that the office should     be   held
by a man of science,           not connected or removable with the ministry
of the day, but who should give his talents and time to the actual
working of the department. The office, as thus remodelled, was
conferred upon Sir John Herschel, in acknowledgment of the high
eminence which he had attained in so many branches of science.
He held the       office  till  1855, when he resigned         it from   bad health,
and    Dr Graham        was then appointed.            He continued     to hold the
office and discharge its duties            till his death with the utmost dili
gence and efficiency.*
    All   who knew Graham concur in bearing testimony to the purity
and simplicity of his nature, and to the justice,                   generosity, and
kindness of his conduct.             He was physically too weak, and perhaps
too much engrossed with                scientific    objects, to enter much into
society    ;  and he had no ambition            for display, but was solely bent
 upon the discovery of scientific truth for its own sake, and for the
 advancement        of scientific objects.          He    has been   cut off in the
 midst     of  a noble     and useful      career, when it might have been
 hoped that some years          of  active investigation would still be allowed
 him,    and  from    which    it is not easy to estimate what results might
 have followed.        The   loss which science has thus sustained can only
 be repaired by      similar exertions      made      in a similar   spirit by  those
 who possess the natural qualifications that are essential to scientific
 inquiry.
    Dr Graham,         for some       time previous to his last illness,          had
occasionally gone         to Malvern for         a day or two at the end         of   a
week, and derived much benefit from the change.                         On the last
   *  If  any further change he contemplated in this department, it is to he
hoped    that it will not tend to deprive men of science of what is at once a
fair reward and a fitting sphere of usefulness.

20                    Proceedings    of the Royal Society
occasion, however, of his being there, he had over-fatigued himself
by walking, and caught a chill from falling asleep near an open
window.        The result    was an attack of inflammation          in one of the
lungs.      He returned immediately          to London,     where his medical
advisers from the first took an unfavourable view of his case, either
in its immediate or ulterior consequences.           He  died on 16th Septem
ber, after ten days' illness, having been assiduously attended by              his
sister and one of his nieces.            His remains   were    brought to Glas
gow, and interred         in the family     burying-ground      attached to the
Cathedral, where two months before he had erected a tombstone to
the memory of his parents and other members               of the family, space
being left merely for his own name and that of his only surviving
 lister.
      Charles Frederick Philip         von   Martius,   the greatest,    perhaps,
 and most celebrated botanist        of the  present  day, was born at     Erlan-
 gen, in Bavaria, in the year 1794.             His family     are said to have
 been    of Italian origin, but they      had been for some      time settled   in
 Bavaria, where his father had         a  medical appointment in connection
 with the court.        Young Jlartius received, in      the first instance,   the
 usual medical education, but when about eighteen years                    of age
 resolved     to devote     himself to botany, and shortly afterwards was
 appointed to     a  subordinate position in the Botanic Garden at Munich.
  His diligence in that situation, and           the merit    of   some treatises
  which be then published, attracted the notice of Maximilian Joseph
  1.,  who   was an ardent lover       of plants,   and   a  frequent visitor to
  the garden.       In  1816, when the joint expedition was concerted           by
  Austria and Bavaria to explore the natural history of Brazil, Mai tins
  was named       by the king as the Bavarian botanist, though then little
  more than twenty-two         years of age.      He immediately       set out on
  this enterprise, and was absent for a period of four years, having
  returned to Munich on the 8th of December 1820.                    The explora
  tions made by the two Bavarian travellers, Spix and Martius, who
  proceeded     in  a separate  direction, and over a wider field than their
  Austrian     associates,   were on a scale much larger and more compre
  hensive than any that had previously been attempted. The expe
  dition, we are told, irrespective of the sea voyage, extended over
  nearly 1400 geographical miles, and for months led through the

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1869-70.                             21
 most     inhospitable and dangerous regions of the New World.                 Both
 explorers, however, escaped without any important disaster on the
 road, and      they had the rare good fortune to preserve and bring
 home       their collections, complete and uninjured, through all the
  l,erils to which they were exposed.               These collections,   finer and
  richer than all previous and most subsequent                ones    from Brazil,
  were made over to the Academy.
       The task thus successfully achieved established Martius's reputa
  tion, and settled for life the special destination of his studies. He
   received from his sovereign distinguished             honours, and was recog
   nised by men of science as worthy of a high place among them.
   The publication of the narrative of this Brazilian journey, which
   appeared in 1823-31, and which, in consequence of the early death
   of Spix, was chiefly prepared by Martius, carried the admiration
   of his talents to a very high pitch.           There was here seen a worthy
   rival of Alexander Humboldt; and              readers were  at a loss whether
   to admire      most the copiousness of the information           furnished,     or
    tiie beauty of the diction, and the poetical and yet truthful power of
    the colouring, in which were presented all the characteristic features
    of those wonderful regions, with their productions and their inha
    bitants. A relative work at the same time was commenced, and
    continued in a magnificent series of volumes, exhibiting to scientific
    eyes the minute representation and description            of the natural ob
    jects, whether plants or animals, with which the expedition had made
     the travellers    familiar.    The    esteem    in which  these works were
     held procured for Martins the distinguished          honour of being elected
     a member      of the French Institute.         He  was enrolled in nearly all
     the other learned bodies in Europe         ;  he was appointed an Honorary
     Member of our own Society in the year 1855.
         After the accession of Louis        I. to the Bavarian   throne, Martius
      was appointed     Professor    of Botany     in the University of Munich,
•
      and subsequently      was promoted to be         Chief Conservator of the
      Botanic Garden.
         In  1823,  Martius began      his celebrated Monograph upon Palms,
      which was completed iu three folio volumes in 1845.                 It is con
      sidered one of the finest monuments of modern botany, and is said
      to contain    a description     of  582   different species  of Palm, while
      Linnaeus     had   only    given   15.   and    Humboldt    99.     It  was   to

22                  Proceedings of the Eoyal Society
this   work that his friends specially           alluded when, in 1864,            on
the jubilee of his graduation         at the Academy, a medal was struck
in his honour, dedicated         " Palmarum Patri," with the motto
                                                                                " Tu
 Pai.mis Resuroes ;" and the same idea was followed when, four years
afterwards, on 13th December 1868, his bier was bedecked                        with
palm leaves, and       a  similar motto inscribed       on his tomb.
    The last great work in which Martius           was engaged      is the
                                                                           " Flora
 Brasiliensis,"    which was continued, from time to time, upon a scale
 worthy of the subject, and at his death had reached its forty-sixth
part.    It  is to be hoped that it will be continued in the same spirit
 in which it was begun.
    Martius    was a most popular lecturer, and          in every way   a superior
 man.     His general intellectual        powers were very great, and his
readiness to communicate             his   knowledge       was  unfailing.       His
 hospitality   was liberal, and his best recreation, after the          labours of
each day, was the reception in his house of scholars, travellers, and
men of science, and more especially of young inquirers after know
ledge, whose projects and aspirations he delighted to encourage and
direct.    He died in his seventy-fifth         year  ;   but I regret  that   I  am
unable to state any particulars as to that event, or his last illness.
    Among those members whom we have this year lost by death                        is
the  late venerable and excellent pastor of St Stephen's Church, in
this city.     He took no prominent part          as a man     of science,  but he
felt an interest in its progress, and watched its rapid advance              ;   and
though not mixing actively in the proceedings or debates of this
Society,    he   strongly    approved of its objects and           recognised     its
benefits.     It  is an honour to have such men enrolled among us,
and when they are removed           in the  course of nature, they should        not
be deprived     of  the   just tribute   to which    their virtues and talents
are entitled.
   Dr William Mum           was a native    of Glasgow, the     son  of a Glasgow
merchant.       He   was a distinguished     student at Glasgow University,
and having chosen the Church for his profession, he was ordained                   in
the year 1812.       It is said that  his own predilection originally was for
the Church      of England,     and that he entered the Scotch Church              in
deference to his father's wish.           However this may be, the choice
then made by him was fully ratified by his ultimate convictions

                      of Edinburgh,      Session 1869-70.
He was first assistant, and afterwards              minister,   of St George's,
Glasgow, and was about the year 1822 removed to the New Grey-
t'riars'  Church, Edinburgh. On the erection of the parish of St
Stephen's in 1828, be was appointed to that charge, which he
continued      to hold   till bis  death on 23d   June  last.
    In every situation in which Dr Muir              was placed as a minister
be discharged       his parochial duties in the most exemplary and effi
cient manner; in particular            in St Stephen's parish, of which he
was     the pastor for forty years, not only his ministrations              in the
pulpit, but bis diligence in personal attention to his flock, his care
of the young, his kindness to the sick and suffering, and his
organisation       for the promotion       of education,  and    the diffusion of
sound Christian faith and active Christian              practice, were such as
to call    forth  the strongest feelings      of gratitude and admiration in
his congregation        and   parishioners.    His elders, embracing among
them some of the           most eminent and respectable of our citizens,
concurred in looking upon his pastoral services as invaluable, and
omitted no opportunity of testifying            their confidence in his char
acter and their sense of his worth.             Documents have been placed
 in my hands, by some of their number, which enable me to make
 these statements with a perfect conviction              that they are in no
 respect    exaggerated, and that Dr Muir was, in all his parochial
 relations, the model of a Christian           minister.     I  have read with
 peculiar interest the proceedings of his congregation in 1862, when,
 on occasion      of his completing the fiftieth year of his ministry, they
 placed at     his disposal the fruits of a liberal subscription among
 them, but which he declined to receive personally, and insisted on
  forming     into a sinking fund, of which          the proceeds     were to be
 annually applied to pious and charitable uses, parochial or congre
 gational.      I have  also read, with a perfect persuasion of its sincerity
  and truth, the address which the late excellent Dr Hunter delivered
  in 18C4, on occasion of Dr Muir being compelled to withdraw from
  active duty in consequence of a failure of eye-sight, with which
  he was visited.       That   address was obviously from the heart of the
  speaker, as it must have gone            to the hearts of those who heard
  him, and bears unequivocal testimony to the high character of the
  man who was the subject of it.
     This is not the place        to speak   of Dr Muir's     career or opinions,

24                         Proceedings        of the Royal Society
either on religious or on ecclesiastical questions.                               I   may ventuie,
however,         to make one or two observations in connection with these
matters.
     1.   Dr Muir, from         an early period of his ministrations,                      came to
occupy      a    somewhat peculiar position as                   a   minister.        He belonged
to what was called the             Moderate party in the Church, having no
sympathy with the               strong views either of popular rights                          or of
spiritual independence, which characterised the High Church Pres
byterians.          But the Moderate party had also the reputation, whether
well or     ill founded, of being rather                  too    moderate in their doctrinal
views;      and,      in    this respect,         Dr Muir's opinions                  and style      of
preaching were more decidedly and prominently evangelical, as it

     2.   Dr Muir's opinions            were          always listened to in the Church
Courts with           respect    and        deference;          but he was not altogether
adapted         to the position    of       a party leader,          which, in other respects,
he might have well attained.                      He had a fault, or what will be con
sidered such by some men     but it was that fault which a delightful
                                        ;
poet has ascribed to the greatest man of his own age — he was
                     " Too fond of the riyht to pursue the
                                                           expedient."
     It   has been         well observed          to me, by one          who      knew him well,
that it is      a   rare    thing, and anything                 but a disparagement, when
all that can be said against a man                       is,   that he followed conscience
exclusively, and valued integrity and independence too high for
any price to tempt him even to the semblance                             of   a   surrender.
     Perhaps his most marked characteristic                           was this high-minded
conscientiousness of disposition.His habit of making conscience
of everything made him appear stiff and unbending to those from
whom he differed in opinion, and many may think that he took
the alarm too soon and too sensitively when he thought that even
the outworks         of principle       were       in danger.          His    steadfastness     cer
tainly to what he held the truth never                          quailed;      his independence
was unshaken by what to others might                             even seem legitimate feel
ings.      His superiority        to    all selfish motives had in                 it   the essence
of chivalry.          Though to strangers his manner was reserved,                             those
who had the privilege of familiar                      intercourse with him knew that
beneath     the surface         there       lay   a   native geniality of temper which

as warm as ever beat          in human  bosom.
    Dr Muir was       an accomplished scholar, and     all along kept himself
abreast    of the literature and science of the day.         He was well read
in the classics, and had a more than usual acquaintance with the
literature of his own profession.         Suffering for a year or two before
his death under nearly total blindness, he had a reader always with
him, to read to him his favourite authors, not in English merely ,
but in Latin and Greek, and even Hebrew.
     Dr Frederick Penney, Professor of Chemistry in Anderson's
 Institution,      Glasgow,     was  born in London in        1817.     He   was
 bronght up as a professional chemist, having early shown a predi
 lection for that branch of science.         He studied under Mr Hennel of
 London     ;  and   it has been stated that      he  was present     when his
 instructor     was   killed, while conducting     some   experiments,     by an
 explosion      of fulminating powder.       Dr Penney recommended him
  self very early by important experiments and communications                 on
  chemical     subjects   ;  and in 1839, while only twenty-two         years of
  age, when the Chair            of Chemistry,   which   he   ultimately held,
  became vacant, he was recommended for the                 office  by the late
  Professor Graham, and unanimously appointed by the patrons.                 Dr
  Penney was a man of great talent, quickness, and intelligence,             and
  an excellent chemist, both theoretical and practical.            As a chemical
  analyst, he enjoyed a high reputation for his fidelity and accuracy,
  and,  I  should suppose,        must have derived a considerable income
  from that source.         In  one department, that  of  a scientific witness,
  I  can   bear   personal testimony to his ability and excellence.          His
  evidence in the witness-box was always clear, ready, explicit,             and
  consistent;     and he had one qualification       essential to every good
  scientific    witness, but which is certainly not possessed by all who
   place themselves in that position, — he underwent the operation of
   cross-examination        with perfect composure and good temper, and
   showed himself as ready to speak to any fact that seemed to bear
   against    the side adducing       him  as he  had   been to give evidence
   in its favour.        This demeanour, which every scientific witness
   should at least assume, made his testimony very influential and
   valuable.      In his private relations, Dr Penney appears to have

 been au amiable and agreeable            man, with strong feelings of affec
 tion to his friends, and much kindly consideration for the feelings
 of others.     He   was well    informed      and highly accomplished.        He
 was fond     of travelling     when he could command a holiday,              and
 his skill  as an   amateur artist enabled him the better to enjoy and
 perpetuate the beauties of the scenery which he visited.
    His frame     was never robust, and for some time past he suffered
 from a complication       of ailments, which terminated his life on the
 2d November 1869, at the age            of fifty-two.
    His funeral     was attended by many scientific friends and respect
 able citizens    of Glasgow, as well as by the chief office-bearers of
 Anderson's Institution, and the students of that seminary joined
 the procession     and proceeded      with it to the burying-ground.
    Ur William Seller,          an eminent       member of the medical pro
fession, and long an esteemed             Fellow of this Society, was born
in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, in 1798, the son of a respectable
merchant, who died while his family were children,                leaving them
under the charge of a widow, who was herself still young, and
who found that, in consequence              of losses arising from misplaced
confidence     in    others, she    must depend        on   her own    exertions
for the    family's     support.      She came to Edinburgh          as a better
field, both for earning a livelihood and educating her children, and
here her son     William had the advantage of the excellent educa
tion which the High School and the University afforded. He was
distinguished at both of these seminaries, and latterly was enabled
to assist his mother by his creditable exertions in private tuition.
    He became at the University a member of the Dialectic Society,
where he formed         many pleasing and permanent friendships             with
several of his contemporaries, including,           among others, Lord Deas,
Dr Aitken, for many       years the    Minister of Minto, and DrCumming,
Government Inspector of Free Church schools.                 With these gentle
men he maintained a         life-long friendship,      as well as with many    of
those whom he had attended            as private tutor, and who had learned
to respect   his learning and his virtues.          Ultimately he made choice
of medicine    as  his profession, and     took the degree of M.D. in August
1821.
    Prudential considerations        led   him soon     afterwards to uiiike his

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1869-70.                                    21
knowledge and abilities available in a form which generally brings
to thosewho adopt it less honour than its usefulness and its in
trinsic merit truly deserve. He opened a house for the reception
of medical students as boarders             during the College session, and
instituted classes for preparing such students for their examina
tion.   It   is not impossible that the department thus chosen by him
formed some impediment             to his success as a medical practitioner;
but no one who knew Dr Seller, or watched his conduct, could fail
to see, both in his choice and in the manner in which he followed
it out, proofs of his manly independence, and of his earnest desire
to promote medical science and maintain the dignity of his pro
fession.   His lectures and lessons, we believe, were admirably
adapted for that purpose, delivered in the most kindly and con
ciliatory    tone,      and   skilfully framed to        lead    his pupils       by easy
gradients to the most commanding                 views of medical knowledge.
His general learning and accomplishments were at the same time
suited in an eminent degree to illustrate and adorn medical
studies.      He   was an excellent classical scholar;            he was profoundly
acquainted with the intellectual           and    moral sciences,       for which he
had early shown a strong predilection              ;   and he was a proficient in
those physical       sciences which were most closely connected with his
own professional subjects.            The extent       and accuracy of his          infor
mation were only equalled by his readiness in communicating                             it
and his modest estimate of his own acquirements.
   His last   book, which he published in conjunction                 with    Mr Henry
Stephens, on "Physiology at the Farm," will illustrate at once, to
those who are capable          of appreciating     it,   the extent and variety of
his scientific knowledge, and some defects at the same time which
attended his mode of conveying instruction in this form.
   In that    volume there       isa   marvellous exposition of all the most
important facts and principles connected with the subject of animal
growth and nutrition, particularly as applicable to the rearing and
feeding of stock     ;   and the ground there travelled over in physiology,
anatomy, chemistry, and botany             is   so extensive, that no one who
was not     thoroughly master of all       these subjects could do them the
justice which has there been dealt to them.                     The only fault in his
dissertations      is   that they are too profound,             and   that   it   may be
necessary to find an interpreter to stand between                  the man    of science

and the practical farmer.   From this fountain, however, all in
structors desirous of communicating to those concerned a familiar
and available view of the truth on these subjects will be able to
draw the most important           and reliable     materials.      In   the prepara
tion of this book,         Mr Stephens, in      a pleasing letter       addressed         to
me, bears      testimony to the assiduity, readiness, and disinterested
zeal of Dr Seller, who declined all remuneration for his labours,
though offered from a high quarter, and was with difficulty per
suaded to let his own name stand first on the title-page before
that of his excellent associate, who in the scientific              department            of
the book felt how great a claim Dr Seller had to the commenda
tions due to the work.
   I am     not personally acquainted with his other productions, and
should be    ill qualified to form      an estimate of    their worth       ;   but a   full
account of these will be found in the notice of Dr Seller contained
in the " Edinburgh Medical Journal" for May 1869. That memoir
 is,
 I    believe, from the pen of Dr Alexander Wood, who was on
the most intimate terms with him, and who has shown his ability
both to appreciate and to record the talents and virtues of his friend.
   Mention    is   there made of the great merit of the lectures on Mental
Diseases which he annually delivered, under the Morrison                         Endow
ment, in the College of Physicians.   "We have called them
wonderful," Dr Wood says " they were truly so, whether we have
                                 ;
respect     to the    learning    they     displayed,     to the   acuteness            and
originality of the views which they enforced, or to the power of
mental analysis which they exhibited.    But," he adds, "   ever                 if
published, they will         require     some    gifted    and loving hand               to
popularise the style, and let the whole matter down to the compre
hension of the busy workers of our every-day world."
   The same memoir contains              a full account of the professional
honours which         he   attained.     Among the most distinguished of
these     was his appointment          as President  of the Royal College of
Physicians     from 1848 to 1850.            He was also the librarian of that
College and    a    councillor   for twenty years.        A   few years ago they
did him the honour to request him to sit for his portrait, to be hung
in the new hall, and the picture thus painted was among the last
works of the late Sir       John Watson Gordon.            Dr Wood thus speaks
of his personal character with equal kindness and truth                 :—

                        of Edinburgh,       Session 1869-70.                        29
    " His moral
                     qualities reached almost higher than his intellectual,
and were      the secret of the influence        he possessed, and of the affec
tion   with which he was regarded.                 His courtesy of manner and
delicacy    of   feeling   marked   him    as  a true  gentleman in all that he
did. In him sterling integrity, firmness of principle, unswerving
rectitude, and thorough persuasion             in his own mind, were combined
with a breadth of view, and            a tolerance    for the opinions, ay, even
for the weaknesses,         of others, as pleasing as     it is  rare.  Guileless as
a   child, he was yet sagacious beyond most men                ; while the delicate
susceptibilities       of his kind heart        prevented    him from saying or
 doing    anything       that could by possibility wound            the feelings of
 another."
     In society Dr Seller's       manners     were most    genial and agreeable,
 and he had the         power of attaching to himself all who made                 his
 acquaintance.        MrStephens,his "collaborateur" in the "Physiology
 of the   Farm," and who        came to know him only through their union
 in that work, writes to me of him — "            I never made      so dear a friend
 on so   short a notice."
     Until about the year         1865   Dr Seller enjoyed        a fair amount of
 good   health, and retained his active habits;             but shortly after that
 time his    constitution    gave way;       and when, after some interval, he
 sought    medical     advice,  a complication of disorders was discovered
 to  exist, including disease of the heart.
     Under     the    care  of Mr      Archibald     W. Dickson,         assisted   by
 other   eminent medical friends, the worst symptoms were kept in
 check for a time, but at last resisted the remedies applied to them,
 and made      it apparent that his end was approaching.                He   bore the
 sufferings    incident to his illness with the fortitude of           a philosopher
 and the    resignation of a Christian.           He discussed     with his medical
 attendants      every symptom of his malady, and its probable termina
 tion, with     the  same calmness      as  if the patient had been a stranger.
 He retained his courtesy and kindness to                all around him         to the
 very last.       His death    occurred    on the 11th    April    1869,   at the age
 of seventy-one.        The great    respect with which he was regarded            was
 shown by the number of those who, unbidden, were present at his
  funeral.     The College of Physicians, who had long considered him
 an honour to their body, attended in their official robes, preceding
  the coffin to the grave, and surrounding it while the last rites were

30                Proceedings of       the  Royal Society

one who had so many high attainments and so amiable a character
— so many solid and      so many agreeable       qualities.
   James Wardeop, one of our oldest members,              and long known as
a  very eminent surgeon, was born, in August 1782, at Torbanehill,
a small property which had been long           in his family, and which        has
since earned a marked reputation in a mineral and chemical as well
as a forensic point   of view.    He commenced the study of medicine
under the care of his uncle, Dr Andrew Wardrop, an eminent surgeon
in Edinburgh. He became assistant to Dr Barclay, the celebrated
anatomist, and was for some time house-surgeon in the Royal                 Infir
mary here.     He afterwards went       to London, to prosecute       his studies
in the lecture-rooms and hospitals of the metropolis         ;   and afterwards
passed over to Paris, though by        this time the    peace   of Amiens     had
been   broken off, and war had recommenced between                  France    and
England.     Had he been known as an Englishman,                 he would have
been   detained as a prisoner      ;  but he contrived to elude the vigil
ance  of the police whilst    he remained in Paris, and ultimately            suc
ceeded   in effecting his transit from France into Germany.                    He
attended various lectures at Vienna, and had there his attention
specially directed to the diseases         of the eye, for the treatment of
which he afterwards attained so high a reputation.                On returning
to  Edinburgh,     be commenced        the practice of his profession, and
very soon selected      surgery  as his department.           After practising
here for four or five years,    Mr Wardrop left Edinburgh, and settled
in London as a surgeon.        Instead of attending, however, the public
hospitals   there established,      he preferred     to institute     a surgical
hospital of his own, the wards of which were thrown open to the
profession gratuitously,     and where he had a weekly concourse                 of
visitors, when medical topics were made the subject of conversation.
This hospital     he continued    to superintend for about eight years,
when he found the labour that it involved was more than he could
undertake consistently with his other avocations.              In this manner,
and   from surgical     lectures which       he   delivered    in London,       Mr
 Wardrop's reputation      became     well established.      In    1818, he was
appointed Surgeon Extraordinary to the Prince Regent ; and when
the Prince, after his accession to the throne, visited Scotland, Mr

                           of Edinburgh,            Session 1869-70.                                      3l
Wardrop attended                  bim.     He is understood to have                      been a great
favourite with the king               ;   but, towards the last days              of that monarch,
a misunderstanding                 at Court arose              which excluded            Mr Wardrop
from attendance, in consequence,                          it     was thought,         of his having
complied too frankly with the king's urgent inquiry as to the
nature and probable termination of his disease.                                   There can he no
doubt that Wardrop was right in the opinion                                  he formed, though
whether the communication                     he made was consistent with the rules
of courtly etiquette is not easy to determine.                               It    is,   however, be
lieved that, from some of those who                               had    been     instrumental            in
excluding        him from the royal death-bed, Mr Wardrop ultimately
received        an   ample apology.                Mr Wardrop, though                    an    excellent
surgeon      in all       respects,       soon     showed        a    special familiarity              with
ophthalmic           surgery, and attained the highest reputation                                in    that
department, both               by   his writings and his practice.                       In    1813,    Mr
Wardrop published the well-known                           of James Mitchell, the boy
                                                          case
born    blind and deaf, who,              I   believe, only died in the present year.
The case excited          a   great deal of interest both among metaphysicians
and physiologists.  Mr Wardrop's account of       extremely in             it    is
teresting and curious. He bad partially succeeded in admitting
light to the boy's eye by operating for cataract, and the sight was
thereby improved,                 so as to       afford        the patient      the delight            that
colours     could convey, and which he keenly enjoyed, though his
vision    still remained             too imperfect             to become     a source          by which
practical information of external objects could be introduced.                                          Mr
Wardrop was           a   man of very varied tastes and talents.                               He   had   a
great     love and appreciation of art.                          He   was very fond of horses,
and frequented              the     hunting-field         till   a    comparatively           late age    ;
and    it   was      with     great satisfaction               that     he wrote      his essay on
the diseases         of   the eye     of that animal, which obtained                     a    prize from
the Board        of Agriculture.              It   has been said that he operated                     with
success     on several valuable race-horses                        and    hunters by couching
them for cataract, to the great gratification of their owners; but
whether the animals when so treated required                               a    pair of spectacles
or an     artificial lens         to supply the place of the extirpated humour,                         l
nm unable to tell.
 I      shall                             Mr Wardrop's works,
                 not here attempt any account of
which must be well known to medical men, who are most likely jn

32                  Proceedings of          the Royal Society
feel an interest in the subject.             An enumeration of them is given
in Pettigrew's       "   Medical Portrait Gallery," where also the inci
dents of his life are fully narrated.               I believe that he enjoyed a
peaceful and cheerful old age, and attained his eighty-seventh year,
without much suffering.              I have heard that he latterly        discontinued
the use of wine, and attributed               to that circumstance mainly his
continued enjoyment of health.                 He had always been a temperate
man, his favourite beverage              being tea.    Not very long before his
death he had the misfortune to lose his wife, who also attained a
great age, and latterly           his eyesight failed him completely.              This
he felt as a great privation,              but he bore      it with patience, and
never murmured.           He sank into        a state  of great    weakness,      which
gradually      led to his death without           any struggle.      He      was much
loved and respected         by all who knew him, and his reputation                   as
a  good man and as an excellent               surgeon, and especially as a dis
tinguished and scientific oculist, ought not soon to be forgotten in
1lis  profession.
    It  is said that he has        left behind him    a manuscript record         of his
recollections, which,        if   published, would in all probability, coming
from     a man   of his ability, observation, humour, and experience,                 be
highly interesting, not only to the profession, but                to the public.

1.   On the Geological Structure of some Alpine Lake-Basins.
                   By Archibald Geikie, Esq., F.R.S.
    In this paper the author reviewed the arguments by which            the
geologists     of Switzerland   endeavour to prove that the so-called
"orographic" lakes are essential parts of the architecture of the
Alps.      He showed from detailed sections of one or two lakes, parti
cularly of the Lake of the Four Cantons, that the amount of denuda
 tion, which the surrounding rocks had suffered,      demonstrated     that

  the lakes must be greatly younger than the plication         of   the strata
  of the Alpine chain   ;  that from the known effects of subaerial denu-
  datoni, the lakes must be, in     a geological sense, quite modern    ;  and
  that the Alpine lakes possessed no distinctive features which en
  titled them to be considered apart from the numerous lakes which
  are scattered  over northern Europe and America.          He  regarded the
  enormous development of lakes at the present period            in northern
  latitudes as a fact which could not be explained by reference to
  subterranean movements.         Such movements must have taken place
  in a late geological period, otherwise the lakes would have been
  filled up with sediment, as is going on every day.          He could not
 but think that the formation of such lake-basins was connected in
  some way with the action of the denuding forces, and he believed
  that the theory proposed        by Professor   Ramsay — that the rock-
 basins had been hollowed out by the ice of the glacial period — ful
 filled all the geological      conditions   of the problem,      and  would
 eventually come     to be accepted    even by the geologists    of Switzer
 land.
      2. Preliminary Notice of the Great Fin Whale, recently
           stranded at Longniddry.           By Professor Turner.
      This communication     was preliminary   to a more extended memoir
 which the author hopes to lay before the Society during the Session.
      The colour, general form, and dimensions of the animal, were
 taken when the whale was lying on the shore at Longniddry.               The
 observations on its internal structure were made whilst it was
 undergoing the operation of flensing at Kirkcaldy, or on specimens
 which were brought over to the Anatomical            Museum of the     Uni
 versity.    These specimens it was his intention to preserve in the
 Museum.       In conducting the examination        he had been ably and
 willingly   seconded     by the thoroughly      cordial  and enthusiastic
co-operation of his assistant      Mr Stirling, and his pupils Mr Millen
Cough trey, and    Mr James Foulis.
     Most of the  Fin Whales which had        been   subjected to examina
tion by British and Continental anatomists had been found floating
dead on the surface of the sea, and had then been towed ashore ;
but the Longniddry whale had got entangled, whilst living, amongst

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1869-70.                            35
the rocks and shoals, where         it was left   as the tide receded.         The
length    of the animal, measured from the tip of the lower jaw to
the end of the tail, 78 feet 9 inches.         The girth of the body imme
diately behind the flipper was 45 feet.            Its girth in line with the
anal orifice was 28 feet, whilst around the root of the tail it was
only    7 feet   6 inches.    The inner surface of the lower jaw,         close to
its upper and outer border, was concave,            and sloped inwards so        as
to    admit the      edge  of the upper jaw within it.          The lower jaw
projected      at the tip 1£ foot beyond the upper.          The length from
 the angle of the mouth to the tip of the lower jaw, along the
 upper curved       border, was 21 feet     8  inches.     The dorsum of the
 upper jaw was not arched in the antero-posterior                 direction.     It
 sloped    gently upwards      and   backwards     to the blow holes, from
 which a low but readily recognised median ridge passed forwards
 on the beak,       gradually   subsiding   some     distance behind      its tip.
 On each side      of this ridge   was a shallow    concavity.     Immediately
 in front of the blow holes the ridge bifurcated, and the forks passed
 backwards, enclosing the nostrils, and then subsided. The outer
 borders    of the upper jaw      were  not straight, but extended forward
 from the angle       of the mouth for    some    distance in    a gentle curve,
 and then     rapidly converging in front, formed a somewhat pointed
 tip.     Their rounded palatal edge fitted within the arch of the
 lower jaw.         The transverse diameter of the upper jaw over its
 dorsum, between the angles of the mouth, was 13 feet 3 inches.
 From the blow holes the outline of the back, curved upwards and
 backwards, was uniformly         smooth and rounded, and for a consider
 able distance      presented  no dorsal mesial ridge.        From     the tip of
 the lower jaw to the anterior border of the dorsal fin the measure
 ment was 59 feet       3 inches.   This fin had    a falcate posterior border.
 Behind the dorsal fin the sides of the animal sloped rapidly down
 wards to the ventral surface, so that        the dorsal and ventral mesial
 lines were clearly       marked, and the sides tapered off to the tail.
 The ventral surface of the throat, and the sides and ventral surface
 of the chest and belly, were marked by numerous longitudinal
 ridges and furrows.          When   he first saw the animal,        the furrows
 separating     the ridges were not more       than from    \  to  J inch   broad,
 whilst    the ridges themselves were         in   many places 4 inches in
 breadth, but as the body began          to swell by the formation of gas

3G                 Proceedings      of the Royal Society
 from decomposition,       the furrows     were   opened    up,  became    wider
 and shallower, and the ridges underwent             a corresponding    diminu
tion in breadth.        At the   same   time a considerable change took
place in the contour of the body in the thoracic and abdominal
regions, which presented a huge lateral bulging, giving a greater
girth than when it first came ashore.
    The flipper, which measured 12 feet            3 inches from root to tip
along its anterior convex border, projected from the side of the
body 31 feet 4 inches behind the tip of the lower jaw, and 14 feet
behind the angle of the mouth.              It  curved outwards and back
wards,   terminating     in a free pointed end.         The distance    between
the two flippers,       measured    over the back between           the anterior
borders of their roots, was 18 feet       6  inches.
    On the dorsum of the beak and           of the cranium,      on the back of
 the body, and for some distance down its sides,                the colour was
dark steel grey, amounting in some lights almost to black.                 On a
line with the pectoral flipper the sides were mottled with white,
and on the ventral surface irregular, and         in  some cases large patches
of   a silvery   grey or whitish      colour were seen.        An experienced
whaling    seaman,      Mr Walter Roddam, who            had   repeatedly seen
this kind of whale in the northern seas, told him that it was known
to the whalers     by   the name of "silver bottom."             The dorsal fin
was steel grey or black, except near its posterior border, where               it
was a shade    lighter    and  streaked with black lines.          The anterior
margin of the lobes of the tail, its upper surface near the root and
for the anterior two-thirds, were black, whilst the posterior third of
the same surface and        the  interlobular    notch were lighter in tint.
The upper surface of the flipper        was steel grey, mottled with white
at the root, at the tip, along its posterior or internal border, and on
the under surface     ;  white patches were seen on the upper surface
near the tip, and here they were streaked with black lines running
in the long axis of the flipper.        White    patches   also extended from
the root   of the flipper to the adjacent parts of the sides of the
animal.     The outside of the lower jaw was black, whilst the in
side  was streaked      with grey.      The tongue of the whale!          was of
enormous size.       The dorsum      was comparatively smooth in front,
but at the posterior part it was elevated           into hillocks which were
separated   by deep furrows.       The baleen      had   a deep    black colour.

and consisted         on each     side of plates which       projected from the
palate    into the cavity of the mouth.            The plates   were arranged   in
rows — 370 were counted                on  each   side  — which lay somewhat
obliquely across the palate, extending               from near the base of the
great mesial      palatal ridge to the outer         edge   of the palate.   The
plates   diminished in size so much, that             at the tip, where the two
sets  of baleen became continuous,            they were merely stiff bristles-
The blubber        varied much in thickness.            Mr Tait, by whom the
whale was purchased,           and to whom the author was indebted for the
opportunity      of examining the animal during the flensing operation,
stated that he had obtained             from the blubber, and from the inside
fat, 19 tons 12 cwt.         of oil ; whilst the skeleton, including the lower
jaw, weighed        9 tons 12 cwt., and the baleen,          including the gum,
about one      ton  ;   the weight of flesh,     intestines,   and  other refuse,
 was  estimated at about 50 tons.
    The author believed the whale to be an example of the whale
called   SteypireySr by the Icelanders, a description of which by
 Professor Reinhardt has recently appeared in the Annals of Natural
 History (Nov.         1868).     The SteypireySr has been identified with
the    Bal&noptera Sibbaldii or Physalus Sibbaldii of Gray.                  The
 Longniddry whale differed from the Balcen&ptera musculus (Pltysalus
 antiquorum,     Gray), or common Razor-back, in having            a broader and
 more   rounded beak, in the flipper being longer in proportion to the
 length    of the body, in the      baleen plates, fringes, and palatal mucous
 membrane,      being     deep black, in the plates being longer and broader,
in the   belly possessing a more silvery grey colour, and in the blubber
 being   thicker, so that the animal is commercially more valuable.
    The whale was with calf, but the foetus, a male, had been dis
 placed, and      thrown      out of the abdominal         cavity  into  a space
 between     the outer surface of the right ribs and the blubber. The
 displacement had probably occurred whilst she was being towed by
 the   tail across the firth from Longniddry to Kirkcaldy.                   The
 whale may have entered the firth in order to give birth to her calf,
 as there seems reason         to think that whales do frequent arms of the
 sea  for that purpose.          Although nothing definite seemed to be
 known      of the  period of gestation of the Fin whales, yet, from the
 length     of the    calf — amounting to nearly 20 feet, or about one
  fourth the length of the          mother  — he thought it    was probable that

38                    Proceedings     of the Royal Society
the whale was at or about her full time.               Several square feet of the
 foetal membranes were examined.                The outer surface of the chorion
 was   thickly studded with villi, which over large areas had no
special mode of arrangement ; but in some localities they formed
an irregular network, in others they were seated on long ridge-like
elevations of the chorion, and in other cases conical                 folds of that
membrane,       5  or  6 inches long, were closely covered with          villi. The
placenta was diffused, but with             a tendency to aggregation of the
villi where the chorion        was raised into ridge-like       and conical folds.
    The paper contained          an account       of the  vessels,   the   pharynx,
laryngeal pouch, the omentum, the intervertebral                  discs, the   cylin-
driform fibrous mass which supports the lower jaw, and a description
of the    atlas, axis, hyoid      bone, sternum and pelvis.           The sternum
was shown to be not a rudimentary                bone, but of considerable size,
consisting of three large          lobes     with a posterior pointed process.
The dissection of the foetus proved that the opinion entertained by
anatomists, that in the baleen                whales the sternum is a single
bone developed from one             ossific    centre, is not correct for all the
species.    For in this    Balcenoptera      the foetal sternum consisted of two
distinct    masses     of cartilage,    one     of which    corresponded to the
posterior pointed process, the other to the larger 3-lobed anterior
portion.     The pelvic      bones were also described.         In the   foetus they
were   still cartilaginous,     but had the same general form as in the
adult, which proved that in the process of ossification no important
change took place          in their external       configuration,    and that the
pelvis of the male differs in no essential feature from that of the
female.      From the appearance presented by the skeleton generally,
the large whale         was obviously       in the stage of growth which          Mr
Flower    has   termed " adolescent."

3.   Note on Aggregation in the Dublin Lying-in Hospital.
                          By Dr Matthews Duncan.
    In this   paper   it is pointed out that deliveries are a better means
of arriving     at an estimate of the healthiness            of  an hospital than
amputations      ;  that the deliveries        in the Dublin Hospital        are  re
 markably valuable because of their great number (nearly 200,000),

                      of Edinburgh,        Sestsion 1869-70.                    39
and of the lengtb of time of the hospital's operation (above 100
years) ; and that the evidence derivable from them relative to the
danger of confinement,          as regulated by the amount        of aggregation,
or number        brought     together at the same time, has never been
properly taken.
  It   has been asserted        by Dr Evory Kennedy and others, that the
mortality     is in direct proportion          to   the aggregation.      But   an
analysis of the whole data indisputably shows that in the Dublin
Hospital the mortality does not increase with the increased number
of the inmates, and does not rise with the aggregation. The mor
tality of this hospital is neither in the direct nor in the inverse
ratio of the aggregation.
  The data, indeed, seem to favour the view that the mortality
diminishes when the aagregation is increased. Certainly a smaller
proportional number die         when there were many in the hospital than
when there were fewer.

   The following Communications                     were read:   —
       1.   Ou a Method of Economising our Currency.                      By
                            Andrew Coventry, Esq.
  In    the outset, it was stated that the currency consisted mainly
of a large mass of paper, whose convertibility had been provided
for by Sir Robert Peel's Bank Bill of 1844-45, with which paper,
and the gold set aside for        it,   the author did not propose     to meddle.
But alongside of the paper there circulated            a   large quantity of gold,
and the object of his paper was to economise it.                Now, gold having
only three       uses —as    currency, in the arts, and to discharge debts
abroad —    it   was desirable that some arrangement should be thought

40                 Proceedings       of the Royal Society
of which might relieve it of          the first mentioned     service,  in wh ich
it suffers much waste, and set it free for the two others.
   The plan proposed        was to disqualify     gold, under legal penalties,
for currency or barter within the island, upon which it would flow
into the Bank, to be kept there for the security of the notes which
would take its place, and for the arts and foreign trade.               The gold
currency     being    shown     to  amount to       80  millions,    it was next
explained that, agreeably to an article in the "Economist"                    of 3d
July   last, the saving thereby effected          (in tear and wear, coining
and   recoining)    to the country would be          fully L. 56,000 a year, or
rather L.60,000       a year, as   L.4000 might       be added    for loss by fire
and shipwreck.         As   to   the expense, again, of the paper which
would be needed to represent the 80 millions of gold brought in by
the disqualification,     the   author proposed       to provide for     it in the
following way : — Let the Bank          have to itself two of the 80      millions
of gold, and yet be allowed to issue paper to the full amount of 80.
The uncovered part of the issue would be a slight extension of the
14 or 15     millions already privileged by statute,           and such an ex
tension has been often proposed,           and by able men.         In return for
the two   millions of gold, the Bank might very fairly             be expected to
provide the paper currency and pay the State                  L. 25, 700    a year.
These figures are arrived           at by the terms       of the arrangement
between     the Bank and Government             as  to the 14 millions being
adopted for the two millions          now.     Farther, a return to the use of
small notes in England was recommended, as the experience of
Scotland     showed     that certain     improvements       in engraving       were
complete preventives against forgery            ;  and he advocated      also gold
bars, a suggestion      of the late Mr Ricardo, instead of coins.
   The result of gain      on the whole would be, to the State L.60,000
and L.25,700, besides       L. 18,000 of profit to the Bank after defraying
the paper    currency— or, in all, L. 103, 700 a year, which, capitalised,
would be three millions.
   Such was      Mr Coventry's proposal.            But  he   added    that some
might    reasonably be inclined        to go further, and to take the whole
or part   of   the  remaining      eight of the 78 millions,        making some
compensation to the Bank, of course, seeing that              a reserve    of  78 of
gold against 80 of paper, large at any time, would be extravagant
when gold fell to be disused for currency.                Even if we were to

 assume the cost of 80 millions of paper to be not far short of the
 cost  of maintaining a gold currency of like amount, the scheme
 proposed would have this merit, that it would bring 80 millions of
 gold into the bank, of which 70 millions would be an ample reserve
 against 80 of paper — thus effecting a gain of Ten Millions. Mr
 Coventry showed, too, that bullion was seldom required to be sent
abroad    to any very great amount by the exchanges, and instanced
the year 1864, when the trade          of  the country amounted to nearly
500    millions, and the balance only      to 4£ millions,  or a trifle more.
 2.  On the old River Terraces of the Earn and Teith, viewed
      in connection with certain Geological Arguments for
      the    Antiquity of Man.          By the Rev. Thomas Brown,
      Edinburgh.
    The author described the circumstances which led him, in              1863,
 to begin   the investigation of these terraces, and showed he had traced
their course      along the Earn from Loch Earn to where they meet
 the tide.     He   had also examined the valley of the Teith, and had
 found the same       deposits from the head of Loch        Lubnaig     to near
Stirling. There are three different levels on which the terraces
lie at different heights above the river bed.         The lowest consists of
the present banks        of the stream and haughs or meadows ; above
this there      is an intermediate    terrace, which, in its turn, is sur
mounted by the highest.           Owing to the effects of denudation, one
or other    of these levels is frequently interrupted or obstructed, but
they are ever again found recurring, and the whole three present
themselves so frequently         as to show that this threefold         terrace
system is     the true key to  these valley deposits.    It was shown that
they were neither sea-beaches,         as some   geologists have held, nor
lake-margins, as has been maintained by others, but must have
been formed by the river itself, at some former age, when its
floods   had the power of rising to the requisite height.              All  the
three    terraces    are  found varying     in height at different points
according to the width of the        valley, the strength of the current,
and other      circumstances.     The lowest, which consists of the pre
sent banks,      &c., varies from 3 to 10 feet, according to    the   locality;
 the  second, from 15 to 24; while the third is from            35 to 60, or
    VOL.  VII.                                                        p

42                Proceedings of      the  Royal Society
even   more   above   the river bed.     Numerous         examples were given
of their outward form and inward structure to illustrate these views.
   The author next        proceeded    to describe       the exact geological
position of these deposits.        As the time of the kames or             escars
belonged to the close of the glacial epoch, so the formation of these
terraces  followed the time of the kames, and they were constructed
by river floods out of the pre-existing            collections of gravel, &c.
The fossil remains of the flora of Strathearn, which they enclose,
show that the climate of the period must have been as mild as the
present.
   Certain    geological   arguments     for the antiquity         of man    were
referred to, especially these deduced          from the gravel deposits of
the Somme in France and the Brixham cave in England.                        From
the height at which these         deposits with      flint  weapons    had been
found above the present river courses, it had been held that the
human period must be extended so           as to leave     time for the erosion
of the valleys.     The author    adduced    evidence to show conclusively
that the Scottish valleys had been eroded              down to their present
depth previously      to the   formation    of these old gravel deposits,
which are found at so great a height above the rivers.                 If, there
fore, the analogy     of the Scottish valleys and streams could apply
to those of France and England, the time needed for the erosion
of the valleys must be thrown out of the account.                 It was vain to
attempt to dissociate the formation of the valley system of France
and  England from that of Scotland,          as  if they were not analogous.
He   had  no doubt that these views would be established                ; but, in
the meantime,      it was at least  right that     men should suspend        their
judgment     till the question thus raised         had    been   thoroughly    in
vestigated.

 1   Experiments on the Colorific Properties of Lichens.                   By
            W. Lauder Lindsay, M.D., F.R.S.E, F.L.S.
    The author's   paper consists mainly    of  a Table  exhibiting certain
of  the positive results    of many hundred experiments       on the colour
 ing matters contained in or educible from Lichens.             The experi
 ments in question are partly a repetition, and partly an extension
on a more systematic and complete scale, of a series of researches
 made by the author between 1852 and 1855, the results of which
 were   originally submitted     to the Botanical   Society of Edinburgh.
 The present series of experiments includes the whole family of            the
 Lichens.     The Table represents mainly the effects of chemical           re
 agents on solutions of the lichen colouring-matters,            or colorific
principles, in boiling alcohol or water.        The nomenclature of        the
Colour-reactions     is that of Werner and Syme.        As the subjects of
his experiments, the author confined himself in great measure                to
the lichens contained in published Fasciculi;         so that comparative
experiments may hereafter         be made on   authentic specimens of the
same tpecies and varieties by other observers in other countries.         The
author's results are submitted as a mere pioneer contribution             to a
subject, which has been as yet most imperfectly worked out, viz.,
the Chemistry of the lichen colouring-matters;          but he trusts they
may furnish     a partial   basis for a future more exhaustive      series of
researches   to be undertaken conjointly by Chemists and Lichenologists.
    The present Table illustrates pro tanto —
I. The kinds of colour producible from lichens:          those, viz. —
       (a) Which      exist   ready formed in the thallus   — for  the   most
               part green, yellow, or brown, — and which are of little
               practical utility  ; and
       (b) The colourless colorific principles, which, under the action
               of ammonia and atmospheric oxygen, yield red or purple

               dyes of the class of which Orchil, Cudbear, and Litmus
                are the   familiar   types.
II.   The families, genera, or        species that possess    practical colorific
          value; as well as the relative values of colonic            species   or
          varieties.
III.    The irregularities        or  uncertainties   of colour-development,
           according to
       (a) The condition of the lichen operated on          ;
       (b) The condition of the reageut ; or
       (c)  The circumstances of experiment.
    There is thus a rough indication, on the one hand, of the so-called
 Dye-lichens ; and, on the other, of species and genera that are practi
 cally useless to the colour-maker.
     The present      series  of experiments, moreover,      has a direct prac
 tical bearing on
    I. The recent introduction        of Colour-lcsts as Specific Characters in
            Lichens    ;
   II.   The modern manufacture from Lichens              (e.g., in  France) of
           fast dyes, capable of competing successfully with the brilliant
            coal-tar colours and other dyes of recent introduction ; and
 III.   The   use, which     still lingers in certain parts of Scotland, and
            probably also of Wales and Ireland, of lichens as Domestic
            dye-stuffs.
  2. On the      Principles of Scientific         Interpretation in Myths,
       with Special lleference to Greek Mythology. By Pro
       fessor Blackie.
     Professor Blackie commenced by saying that, of all the branches
  of interesting    and curious learning, there was none which had been
  so systematically       neglected in this country by English scholars as
  mythology — a subject closely connected both with theology and
  philosophy,     and on which those grand intellectual             pioneers and
  architects, the Germans, had expended a vast amount of profitable
  and unprofitable        labour.     The consequence of this neglect was,
  that of the few British books we had on the subject, the most
  noticeable were not free from the dear seduction of favourite ideas
  which possessed the minds of the writers as by               a juggling witch

                     of Edinburgh,      Session 1869-70.                    45
craft, and prevented         them from looking on a rich and various
subject with that many-sided sympathy and catholic receptiveness
which it required. In fact, some of our most recent writers on
this subject have not advanced a single step, in respect of scientific
method,     beyond Jacob Bryaut, unquestionably the most learned
and original speculator on mythology of the last century; but
whose great work, nevertheless, can only be compared to a grand
chase in the dark, with a few bright flashes of discovery, and
happy gleams of suggestion by the way.              For   these  reasons,  and
to make a necessary protest against certain ingenious aberrations of
 Max Miiller, Gladstone, Inman, and Cox in the method of mytho
logical interpretation, he had undertaken to read the present paper;
 which, if it possessed only the negative virtue of warning people
 to be sober-minded        and cautious when entering       on a path    of in
 quiry, full of     bogs   below and clouds above, could not be deemed
 impertinent      at the present moment.
      One great fact as to the origin of Polytheism may         be  considered
 as   firmly established,    and   by general consent admitted — viz., that
 the great physical       shows and forces by which man finds himself
  surrounded      and conditioned,     assuming,   under    the influence    of
  reverence    and imagination,       various  anthropomorphic       disguises,
  constituted    the original council of the great gods.        When    we say
  physical,   however, we do not mean physical          in the material and
  mechanical      modern sense of the word     ; but we mean physical in       a
  sort of pantheistic sense, in which nature is regarded as everywhere
   interpenetrated,    inspired, and fashioned by spirit.       This being so
   and ascertained, be it noted, by an      overwhelming array of strictly
   inductive   evidence, there can be no difficulty         in predicating,    d
   priori, what the great     gods  of the Greeks, to whom     I shall  confine
   myself in this paper, must have been originally in their elemental
   significance.     They must have been those powers of Nature and of
    the human soul, or of Nature considered as animated by a human
   soul, whose display was most striking,         and whose     influence was
    most felt by primeval       man.     Those powers are — The sky, the
   earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the sea and rivers, the atmo
   sphere and winds, the subterranean forces, the underground world,
   and the unseen powers of darkness beyond the grave, the vege
   tative or generative principle, the fervid domain of moral emotions,

46                 Proceedings      of the Boyal Society
and the sovereign sway of intellect.           For   I  do not believe in any
period when man was merely a brute, or a nondescript creature,
half emergent from the primeval man-monkey or monkey-man.
Individual tribes of a low type, such as those whom my ingenious,
acute, and    learned friend,     Mr M'Lennan, calls by the undignified
name    of Totems, may always have existed         ; but in a general Totem-
state   of  an  embryo and        embruted humanity         I do not believe.
Hypotheses of this kind are the conceit of speculative scicence,
not historical fact.      Starting from this base of operations, our first
business is to look our gods fairly in the face, and by a reverential
and poetic study of their forms, attitude, dress, badges, and symbols,
to recreate the anthropomorphised           power in its original elemental
significance.     And this must     be done in an extremely cautious and
careful way, so as to make legitimate            our inductive     conclusions,
after the method of which such admirable examples are given by
Ottfried Muller in his " Prolegomena"            — a small book in respect
of bulk, but a truly great book in respect            of significance   ; and to
the principles    laid down in which it would be well           if some of   our
recent mythological speculators would seriously recur.             Mr Ruskin's
method of interpreting          the Greek gods       without such a careful
scholarly preparation, is mere brilliant trifling         ; and  all excursions
into the realms of comparative mythology and philology, after the
fashion of Creuzer and Bryant, without first taking sober counsel
from home materials, can result only in floating conjecture, not in
stable knowledge.         Now, to give an example of what           I  mean  : if
we take three      of the    principal  gods   of the Hellenic Olympus —
Zeus, Poseidon, and       Apollo— and    peruse them carefully,      I defy any
man who has a common amount of classical reading, and who,                  like
Wordsworth,      can   put himself     into the position      of the original
creators   of mythology, to form any other conclusion than that these
personages are mere anthropomorphic disguises of the heavens, the
ocean, and the sun      ;  and towards forming        this conclusion, with a
man who is entitled        to have   a judgment      on such    subjects, not a
single shred of Hebrew or Sanscrit, or any foreign                  organon    of
interpretation, is required.        It  may be interesting       to know that
Ztv? in its Sanscrit form means           bright  or shining ; but it is not
necessary    towards a well-grounded        scientific induction    of the ori
ginal significance of the god.

    But there are other      persons in the Pantheon whose significance is
anything but plain ; and in their case, unquestionably, recourse may
he had with advantage to etymology, first, in the native language,
of course, and then           in the kindred             languages, in some one of
which the original          form of the sacred                title may have been pre
served.      A striking example of the utility of native etymology in
fixing the significance of the Greek mythological personages is pre
sented in the familiar case of the Harpies, whose whole character
and actions, taken along with the open evidence of their Greek names
in Hesiod, prove, beyond all doubt, that they are the impersonated
forms     of such sudden gusts           and    squalls of wind as come down
fuequently on the Black             Sea or the       Highland lochs.                  But etymo
logy,  though a safe guide in such instances,      in                       is,      less obvious
cases, of all guides the most fallacious.  And this                                          what my
                                                                                     in is
distinguished friend Max Miiller, and some who follow                                        his train,
seem at  the present moment somewhat apt to forget. An etymo
logy, though not caught up in the arbitrary fashion of Bryant and
In man, but traced with the most cautious application of Grimm's
laws, is, after all, only       a   conjecture.          It   is   a   conjecture not in the
teeth     of all philological       analogy.        It   implies        a   possible, or, as the
case may be, a probable identity.    But alone, and without extrinsic
and real, as opposed to verbal indications,   affords no ground for
                                                              it                                     a
legitimate induction.            Nothing       is   more       common than accidental
coincidences      in mythological        names      — such         as the         Latin Hercules
and     the Greek Heracles          — which,    as scholars know, have                        not the
 most remote      connection.         Besides, even           if   the true etymology of
 any Greek      god   could be found in Sanscrit or any other language,
 the signification     of   the original        name          affords no sure clue to the
 character of the accomplished god.                      Our dictionaries              are     full of
 words whose ultimate           signification       has travelled so far away from
 its original, that the original meaning could supply no key to the
 modern usage.         Hop<t,vp(&;,    for instance, means dark in Homer, but
 in Horace brilliant        or shining.        Usage alone can inform us of this
 perversion or inversion            of the original meaning of words.                              But
if   this be true with regard to mere philology,                       it   is    much more true
 with regard to mythology.              The root of            a   word, like the stock of
a   tree, may remain stiff enough for centuries; but the human
 imagination, when employed in the forming of myths,   a kaleido                     is

scope   whose  changes are incalculable,            and whose        results are so
transmuted from the original         type as to be unrecognisable.                 On
these  grounds,   I   feel myself bound to protest in the                  strongest
manner against the fashion recently introduced                    by Max Muller
and   Mr Cox, of giving         a now   interpretation        of Hellenic       gods,
founded on no firmer basis than slippery Sanscrit etymologies, and
a few   ingenious    conjectures.      After reading          the     distinguished
German's lucubrations        on Hermes,       and Athena,         and    Erinnys, I
stand as unconvinced as before the portentous array of Protean
" Radicals," in the first volume of
                                           Bryant; it is only another turn
of the mythological kaleidoscope from the hand of a man who
combines the erudition,       (he  speculation, and the subtlety of his
people, with an eloquence and a taste seldom              surpassed      by the best
Englishmen     writing their own language in the best way — a man
whose character    I  respect, and whose instructive          intercourse     I  have
enjoyed now for a long series of years           ;  but, with regard to whose
speculations on curious points of Greek mythology,                 I  can only say,
Amicus Plato    sed   magis   amica Veritas.        And etymology is not the
only point on which      I  am forced to      dissent from Max Muller and
that large school of German thinkers of whom he is the spokesman
in this century.      A long familiarity with the writings of German
scholars has convinced me that there is a particular                   idiosyncrasy
in their minds which, when applied without qualilication                  in mytho
logical research, is peculiarly     apt    to mislead.        This idiosyncrasy
leads them to believe in no facts that they are not able to construct
from certain favourite presupposed          ideas.     Now,     I  believe in facts
as having an independent value, and a right to be recognised alto
gether independent of any favourite ideas which an interpreter of
facts may bring     to explain    them.      I  believe that one domain ot
myths is to be explained       by ideas  ;   but   I believe     also in a class   of
myths, of which the main root and stem are historical, and only
the outer limbs     and   flourishes mythical.          I  see    no presumption
whatsoever that the TrojanWar           represents a conflict between             the
powers   of light and darkness; that Achilles is                a degraded      solar
god, as  Muller would indicate, or a water god, as             is the fashionable
idea of most Germans.         The most improbable thing in the world
is that a nation     should have drawn a brush over all its human
memories,   and  left nothing     but myths of the Dawn and the Dark

 in the shape of European peeis and Asiatic princes.                    I refuse,
therefore, on the faith of a few specious etymologies, to see any
thing mythical in      the main action    of the "    Ilia*;"    and   I deem    it
a  waste  of brain  to seek the interpretation      of a stout old Thessalian
thane, from a Sanscrit epithet of the sun.              But India     is not the
only country     to   which    adventurous     scholars have travelled          in
search   of a key to unlock the mysteries of the Hellenic Pantheon.
Mr Gladstone,     as  it is well known, has reverted to the expedient          —
a  favourite   one with     our old theological      giants — of explaining
Greek gods through the medium of a primitive sacred tradition.
There might be no objection to this if the Hebrews had possessed
any original quarry of theologic material from which an Apollo or
an Athena could be built up; but the only idea that the Hebrews
could have suppbed to the Greeks was that of the one Supreme
God, whom no doubt we have in Zeus, but unaccompanied with
any special    Hebrew character by which he might be identified.
The same distinguished        scholar's most recent excursion into far
Eastern lands has not brought           back,   in my opinion, any more
valuable booty. That Aphrodite          and   Hercules were of Phoenician
extraction, at least contained       a strong admixture         of Phoenician
 elements, was known long ago         ; and few facts in early Hellenic
history  can  be considered more certain        ;  but beyond this, all pro
positions with regard to early Phoenician influence on the persons
of the Greek Pantheon, seem to me to stand on too slight a basis
of ingenious conjecture to      possess any scientific value.
    Having   made   these protests against the       brilliant,  but, so far as
Greece is concerned, in my opinion           barren    excursions of recent
 writers into the regions of comparative mythology,           I   have only to
                                                                        state of
say in conclusion, that the only safe method in the present
the science of mythology, is to confine our attention to the actual
forms and attitudes aud symbols of the gods as they present them
selves before us in their accomplished impersonation.               By tracing
Hermes, for instance, to the breeze of the early Dawn, nothing is
                                            a pretty fancy of the infant

merce    demands.     Athena, in the same way, the daughter of the
dark-clouded Jove, is the flashing-eyed maiden, because she repre
sents the feminine     aspect    of the sky, of which her sire represents
the masculine.      Juno, again, by many manifest signs, is certainly
the  earth anthropomorphised out of the physical yrj, just as Zttk
was out of ovpavos.       Then, again,       if Apollo  be the sun, Artemis,
his sister, without going further, must be the moon            ;  and Dionysus,
the wine god, whose Oriental origin and late introduction is certified,
stands by virtue of the phallic symbol manifestly an Oriental god
of the generative virtue, just      as Hermes was in Arcadia by the same
symbol proclaimed the patron of breeding to the sheep-farmers
of the Pelasgic peninsula.           Then, by the same process of look
ing   at what is before me, apart from German theories and Sanscrit
etymologies,    I reserve   a  considerable domain in the mythological
land for exaggerated and metamorphic history;                  not at all con
cerned that    I   may be looked on by the winged                 Germans as      a
dull, prosaic fellow, or a     disciple of the atheistic Euhemerus — for
Euhemerus      also  was not altogether          wrong, and the worship          of
human ideals as, at least, one element in many mythologies, is one
of the most accredited facts in the history of the human race.                And
if I seem to have achieved        a  very small thing when         I keep myself
within   these bounds,    I have at least kept myself clear          of nonsense,
which in mythological        science is as common as sunk rocks in the
Shetland    seas.    To Max Miiller,           and other Sanscrit        scholars,
I  hope  I shall always    be  grateful for any happy illustrations         which
they may supply of the general character of Aryan myths, and of
occasional coincidences of the Hellenic mode of imagining with the
Indian   ; and  I think the somewhat cold and unimaginative                race of
English scholars     are under no small obligations to him for having
taught them to recognise poetical significance            and religious value
in some legends,       which     passed    in their nomenclature for silly
fables   or worthless facts    ;  but   I   profess  to have     been   unable to
derive any sure clue from the far East to the most difficult questions
of Greek mythology; nor do         I expect that, when every obsolete word
in the Rig Veda shall have been thoroughly sifted and shaken,                     a
single ray of intelligible light will thence flow           on the      Athena of

1.   On   Reciprocal Figures, Frames, and Diagrams of Forces.
            By J. Clerk Maxwell, Esq., F.R.SS. L. & E.
    The reciprocal    figures treated of in this paper are plane recti
linear figures, such that every line       in   one figure is perpendicular
to the   corresponding    line in the other,     and  lines which meet in a
point in   one figure correspond to lines which form a closed polygon
in the   other.
    By turning one of the figures round 90°, the corresponding lines
become parallel, and are more easily recognised.                The practical
use    of these figures    depends   on  the proposition       known    as the
 "
   Polygon of Forces."       If we  suppose one     of the reciprocal figures
to   represent a system of points acted on by tensions or pressures
along    the lines of the figure, then,     if the forces which act along
these   lines  are represented  in magnitude, as they are in direction,
by the corresponding lines of the other reciprocal figure, every
point of the first figure will be in equilibrium.              For the forces
which act at that point are parallel and proportional to the sides of
a polygon formed by the corresponding lines            in the other figure.
    In all  cases, therefore, in which one of the figures represents         a
 frame,   or the skeleton of a structure which is in equilibrium         under
    tol. rn.                                                         ii

  54                   Proceedings     of the Royal Society
  the action of pressures and tensions in its several pieces, the other
  figure represents a system of forces which would keep the frame                  in
  equilibrium      ; and,  if  the known data are sufficient to determine
  these forces, the reciprocal figure may be drawn so as to represent,
 on a selected scale, the actual values          of all  these forces.
      In this way     a practical method     of determining       the tensions and
 pressures in structures has been developed.                    The "polygon of
            "
 forces has been long known. The application to polygonal frames,
 with a system of forces acting on the angles, and to several other
 cases, was made by Professor          Rankine in his Applied Mechanics.
 Mr W. P. Taylor,            a practical  draughtsman,        has independently
 worked out more extensive applications             of the method.          Starting
 from Professor        Rankine's    examples,    I taught the method to the
 class of Applied Mechanics in        King's College, London,        and published
 a short account       of it in the "Philosophical Magazine" for April
 1864.        Professor Fleeming Jenkin, in a paper recently presented
 to the Society, has fully explained the application of the method to
 the most       important cases occurring in practice, and          I believe   that
 it has been found to have three important practical                    advantages.
 It    is easily taught to any person who can use a ruler and scale.
 It   is quite sufficiently    accurate for all ordinary calculations, and is
 much more rapid than the trigonometrical                  method.       When the
 figure is drawn the whole process              remains visible,       so that   the
 accuracy of the drawing of any single line can be afterwards tested                 ;
 and     if any mistake has been made, the figure cannot be completed.
 Hence the verification of the process           is much easier than that of
 a long       series  of arithmetical    operations, including the use             of
trigonometric        tables.
     In the present paper       I have endeavoured       to develope the idea     of
reciprocal figures, to show its connection with the idea of reciprocal
polars as given in pure mathematics, and to extend it to figures in
three dimensions,         and   to cases  in which the       stresses,   instead of
being along certain lines only, are distributed continuously through
out the interior of a solid body.           In making this extension of the
theory of reciprocal figures,        I have   been   led to see the connection
of this theory with that of the very important function introduced
into the theory of stress in two dimensions by             Mr Airy, in his paper
"On the Strains in the Interior of           Beams"     (Phil. Trans. 1863).

                  of Edinburgh,         Session 1869-70.                        55
   If a plane  sheet is in equilibrium under the action of internal stress
of any kind, then a quantity, which we shall call Airy's Function
of Stress, can always be found, which has the following properties.
   At each point of the sheet let          a perpendicular      be erected pro
portional to the function         of   stress    at  that  point,   so that    the
extremities of such perpendiculars            lie in  a certain   surface, which
we may    call the surface of stress. In the case of a plane frame the
surface of stress is a plane-faced polyhedron, of which the frame is
the projection.      On another plane, parallel to the sheet, let a per
pendicular be erected of height unity, and from the extremity of
this perpendicular let a line be drawn normal to the tangent
plane   at a point of the surface of        stress, and meeting the plane at
u  certain point.
    Thus,  if points  be taken in the plane sheet, corresponding           points
 may be found by this process in the other plane, and              if both points
 are supposed to move, two corresponding lines will be drawn, which
 have the following property        : — The resultant of the whole          stress
 exerted by the part of the sheet on the right hand side of the line
 on the left hand side, is represented in direction              and  magnitude
 by the line joining the extremities            of the corresponding line in
 the other figure.     In the  case   of  a plane frame, the corresponding
 figure is the reciprocal diagram described above.
    From this property the whole theory of the distribution of              stress
 in equilibrium in two dimensions may be deduced.
    In the most general case of three dimensions, we must               use three
 such functions, and the method becomes cumbrous.               I have, however,
 used these functions in forming equations of equilibrium               of elastic
 solids, in which the    stresses   are considered as the quantities         to be
 determined, instead of the displacements, as in the ordinary form.
     These equations are especially useful in the cases in which we
 wish to determine the stresses in uniform beams.              The distribution
 of stress in such   cases   is determined, as in all other cases, by the
 clastic yielding of the material       ;  but   if this yielding is small and
 the beam uniform, the stress at any point will be the same, what
 ever be the actual value of the elasticity of the substance.
    Hence   the coefficients of elasticity disappear from the ultimate
 values of the stresses.
    In this way   I  have obtained values for the stresses            in  a beam

  56                 Froceedings      of the Royal Society
  supported in     a specified way, which differ only by small quantities
  from the values obtained by         Mr Airy, by   a method    involving cer
  tain assumptions, which were introduced in order to           avoid the con
  sideration of elastic yielding.
            2.  On the Extension of Brouncker's Method.
                             By Edward Sang, Esq.
     The operation in      use by the ancient geometers        for finding  the
 numerical expression for the ratio of two quantities, was to repeat
 each   of them until    some multiple     of the one agreed with a   multiple
 of the other    ; the numbers of the repetitions being inversely pro
 portional to the magnitudes.
     The modern      process,   introduced by Lord Brouncker, under the
 name of continued fractions, is to seek for that submultiple           of the
 one which     may be contained exactly in the other; the numbers
 being then directly proportional to the quantities compared.
     On applying this method to the roots of quadratic equations, the
 integer parts of the denominators were found to recur in periods              ;
 and Lagrange showed that, while all irrational roots of quadratics
give recurring chain-fractions, every recurring chain-fraction ex
 presses the root of a quadratic ; and hence it was argued that this
 phenomenon of recurrence is exhibited by quadratic equations alone.
    The author of this paper had supplemented Lagrange's proposi
tion, by showing that when the progression of fractions converging
to one root of a quadratic is continued backwards, the convergence
is toward the other root.        The singularity of this exclusive property
of quadratic equations led him to consider whether some analogous
property may not be possessed             by equations of higher      degrees.
Putting    aside the idea of the chain-fraction       as being merely acci
dental to the subject, and attending to the series of converging
fractions, he came upon a kind of recurrence which                 extends to
equations of all orders       ;  and which proceeds by operating on two,
three, or more contiguous terms according to the rank of the equa
tion.    In  this way a ready means of approximating          to the greatest
and to the least root of any equation was obtained.
    The following     cases were cited   : —
    If we  begin with the terms jL         ~, and form    a  progression    by

                              of Edinburgh,           Session 1S69-70.                                57
adding the respective members of the preceding                                 term to the doubles
of those of the last, thus —
                          1     1   3       7    17      41     99      239     .
                          0' 1' 2' 5' 12' 29' 70'                       169'
 we    form       the     well-known            series    converging          to the ratio        of the
 diagonal of a square to the side.
   Beginning with the terms                      0, 1,    if   we add    together the last two,
 thus—
                        0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, &c.,
 each term bears to the succeeding one a ratio approaching to that
 of the side of          a regular pentagon to the diagonal thereof.
      If we   assume the three terms 0, 0, 1, and continue                                the progres-
 t-ion by adding to the double                   of the last term, the difference of the
 two preceding ones, thus—
              0, 0, 1, 2, 5, 11, 25, 56, 126, 283, 636, 1429, &c.,
 the ratio of each term to the following approaches to that of the
 side to the greater diagonal of a regular heptagon.
   Or again, beginning                  with the          same three terms,             if   we form a
 progression by deducting the antepenult from the triple of the last
 term, thus —
                  0, 0, 1, 3, 9, 26,75, 216, 622, 1791, 5157, &c.,
 we obtain an approximation                     to the ratio of the side to the longest
 diagonal of a regular enneagon.
   From       these examples            it would         appear that important results may
 be expected from the study                     of this branch of Logistics. Now, the
 roots of quadratics were                   reached by the comparison of two magni
 tudes, wherefore those of cubics may result from the comparison of
 three incommensurables                 ;    and analogously for equations                    of higher
degrees.          The comparison of several magnitudes thus forms the
subject of the paper.
   Assuming three homogeneous quantities,                                A, B, C, arranged in
the order of their magnitudes, we take the second                                     5      as often as
possible from the greatest A, and obtain a remainder less than B                                          •
this remainder may or may not be greater than C.                                    If it    be greater,
we take       C   as often as possible from                    it,   and obtain     a   remainder    I)
less than         C,   the least of the three quantities.                  B,   C,   D may now       be

58                 Proceedings           of the Eoyal           Society
treated in the same way, and thus we form a series of equations —
                                 A =
                                        PtB    + 2,C +        D
                                 B = PlG       + 2aD +        E
                                 C = p4D + 22E +              F, &c.,
in which p   can never be zero, while q may be so.
   In  order to compute, by help of these quotients, the approximate
ratios of A, B, C, we may put                A„ A„ A^ &c. ; B„            Bs, B,, &c. ; C,,
C2,  C„ &c., for the corresponding successive values, and then                           we
obtain the equations —
                 A„ + i   =
                              Pn + i A„ + qn           An-i      +   A„-2,
                 B„ + 1   = p„
                                   + 1 B„ + q„ B„           -i   +   Bt -t,
                    +   1 = Pn +      1 Cn +      qn   Ct   - 1  +   Cn -  2,
which indicate a very simple arrangement, best studied from an
example.     Thus,     if the    successive       equations were       —
                              A    =-   2.B +      l.C + D
                               B   = 3.C +         2.D + E

multiply the newly found A hy the p above it ; the preceding A
by its q, that is in this case 3.2 and 1.1, and write the sum 7 as
the third value                   of A.           Again, taking the sum of the products
PtAt, g,As, and,                  as we           may call it for generality's sake, rtAt, we
have 2.7 + 2.2 + 1.1                           =    19 for    A4.        In       this way we obtain the
successive values of                      A.
     The values of B                      are found           in the         same        way,   observing that
B,   = 0,       B,   = 1.          So also are the values                        of C,    and   if it   be wished,
those of D, E, F, &c., obtained, the first effective term being de
layed a step, as sbown in the scheme.
     This method            was applied to the three irrational quantities, log 5,
log 3, and log 2 ; and the results were used in explaining the doc
trine of musical temperaments.

  The extension of this method                                    to more than three quantities                  is
easy.      In conclusion,                 an opinion was expressed,                      that as the Brounc-
kerian process applied to two magnitudes has already thrown great
light on the doctrine of                                squares,       this extension of                it   may be
expected         to do as much for the                            still higher departments of the
theory         of numbers.

[§60 (a)]        however the solid be moved, or bent, and whatever influ
ences      experienced from other bodies.                           The solid,     if   rigid and left
at rest,      must clearly continue at rest relatively                             to the fluid        sur
rounding       it   to an infinite         distance, provided there be no other solid
within an infinite distance from it.                         But   if there be any other solid or
solids at rest within any finite distance from the first, there                                will be
mutual forces          between            them, which,           if     not balanced by proper
application of force, will cause them to move.                                    The theory of the
equilibrium          of rigid        bodies in these circumstances might be called
Kinetico- statics         ;    but   it   is   in reality       a   branch of physical             statics
simply.        For    we know             of   no case of true statics in which some                      if
not all of the forces are not due to motion                             ;   whether as in the case
of the hydrostatics of gases, thanks to Clausius and Maxwell, we
perfectly understand the character of the motion, or, as in the statics
of liquids and elastic solids, we only know that some kind of mole
cular motion         is   essentially concerned.                    The theorems which         I       now
propose to       bring        before the Royal           Society regarding the forces                   ex
perienced by bodies mutually influencing                                one another through the
mediation of         a    moving liquid, though they are but theorems of ab
stract hydrokinetics, are of some interest in physics as illustrating
the great question of the 18th and 19th centuries                             :— Is action     at   a   dis
tance     a   reality, or      is    gravitation to be explained, as we now believe
magnetic and electric forces must be, by action of intervening matter?
  I.      (Proposition.)         Consider first          a     single fixed body with one or
more apertures through                    it   ;    as   a    particular      example,    a   piece of
straight tube open at each end.                              Let there      be irrotational    circula

proved [from § 63 Exam. (2.) ]* that the velocity of the fluid at any
point in the neighbourhood agrees in magnitude and direction with
the resultant electro-magnetic          force, at the corresponding point, in
the neighbourhood         of an electro-magnet        replacing   the solid, con
structed according to the following specification.             The " core,"     on
which the " wire " is wound, is to          be of any material having     infinite
diamagnetic inductive capacity,!           an<^ 16 *° ^e  °f the same   size and
shape as the solid immersed in the fluid.               The wire is to form     an
infinitely thin layer or layers, with one circuit going round each
aperture.      The whole strength of current in each circuit, reckoned
in absolute electro-magnetic measure, is to be equal to the circulation
of the fluid through that aperture divided by Jiir. The resultant
electro-magnetic force at any point will be numerically equal to
the resultant fluid velocity at the corresponding point in the
 hydrokinetic system, multiplied by
    Thus, considering, for example, the particular            case  of a straight
 tube open at each end, let the diameter be infinitely small in com
                                                       "
 parison with the length.         The " circulation      will exceed by but an
 infinitely small quantity the product of the velocity within the
 tube into the length.          In the neighbourhood of each end, at dis
 tances from it great in comparison with the diameter of the tube and
 short in comparison with the length, the stream lines will be straight
 lines radiating from the end. The velocity, outwards from one end
 and inwards towards the other, will therefore be inversely as the
 square of the distance from the end. Generally at all considerable
 distances from the ends, the distribution of fluid velocity will be the
 same as that of the magnetic force in the neighbourhood of an infi
 nitely thin bar longitudinally magnetised uniformly from             end to end.
     Merely as regards the comparison between fluid velocity and re
 sultant magnetic forces, Euler's fanciful theory of magnetism is thus
 curiously illustrated. This comparison, which has been long known
 as part of the correlation between the mathematical theories of elec-

tricity, magnetism, conduction of heat, and hydrokinetics, is merely
kinematical, not dynamical.   When we pass, as we presently shall,
to a strictly dynamical            comparison relatively to the mutual force
between     two hard steel magnets, we shall find the same law of
mutual action between two tubes, with liquid flowing through each,
but with this remarkable difference, that the forces are opposite in
the two cases       ;    unlike poles attracting       and    like poles repelling in
the magnetic system, while in the hydrokinetic                         there is attraction
between like ends and repulsion between unlike ends.
     II.(Proposition.) Consider two or more fixed bodies, such as the
one    described in Prop. I.    The mutual actions of two of these
bodies are equal, but in opposite directions, to those between the
corresponding electro-magnets.               The particular instance referred to
above shows us the remarkable               result, that through fluid pressure
we can have a system      of mutual action, in which like attracts like
with force     varying inversely as the square of the distance.   Thus,
if the exit   ends of tubes, open at each end with fluid flowing through
them, be placed in the neighbourhood of one another, and the enter
ing    ends be at       infinite distances, the mutual        forces resulting      will   be
simply attractions according to this law. The lengths of the tubes on
this supposition are infinitely great, and therefore, as is easily proved
from the conservation of energy, the quantities flowing out per unit
of time     are but      infinitesimally   affected   by the mutual influence.
     III.   Proposition      II.   holds, even   if   one    of the     bodies considered
be merely a solid,           with or without      apertures        ;    if with apertures,
having      no circulation         through them.       In such          a case as   this the
 corresponding          magnetic system      consists of a magnet or electro
 magnet, and a merely diamagnetic body, not itself a magnet, but
 disturbing     the distribution       of magnetic force around it by its dia
 magnetic influence.           Thus, for example,           a spherical       solid at rest
 in the field of motion surrounding              a fixed body, through apertures
 in which      there is cyclic irrotational           motion, will experience from
 fluid pressure             force through its centre equal and op
                        a resultant
 posite to that experienced by a sphere of infinite diamagnetic capa
 city, similarly situated in the neighbourhood of the corresponding
 electro-magnet.     Therefore, according to Faraday's law for the lat
 ter, and the comparison asserted in Prop.                   I.,
                                                   would experience

irrespectively       of the direction of the stream lines in its neighbour
hood    ; a result easily deduced      from the elementary formula for fluid
 pressure    in hydrokinetics.
     I have    long ago shown that an elongated diamagnetic             budy in a
 uniform      magnetic field tends, as tends an elongated ferromagnetic
 body, to place its length along the lines of force.               Hence   a long
 solid, pivoted on a fixed axis through its middle in a uniform stream
 of liquid, tends to place its length perpendicularly across the direc
 tion of motion ; a known result (Thomson & Tait's " Natural Philo
           "
 sophy,       § 335).    Again, two globes held in a uniform stream with
 the lines joining their centres, require force to prevent them from
 mutually approaching one another.            In  the magnetic analogue, two
 spheres of diamagnetic or ferromagnetic             inductive    capacity repel
 one another when held in a line at right angles to the lines of
 force.      A hydrokinetic      result similar to this for the case of two
                                                                " Natural Philo

 sophy," § 332.
     IV.    (Proposition.)    If the second body considered in §     III., that  is
 to say, a body either having no apertures, or,           if perforated, having
  no circulation      through the apertures, be acted on by one system of
  forces applied so as always to balance the resultant of the fluid
  pressure,     calculated for it according to      II.  and  III.  for whatever
  position    it may  come to at any time, and     if it be influenced, besides,
 by any other system of applied forces, superimposed on the former,
  it will move just     as  it would  move, under the influence      of the latter
 system of forces alone, were the fluid at rest, except in so far               as
 compelled to move by the body's own motion through it.                   A parti
  cular   case   of this proposition was first published many years ago, by
  Professor James Thomson, on account of which he gave the name
  of " vortex of free mobility " to the cyclic irrotational motion sym

 4. On the         Equilibrium of Vapour at a Curved Surface of
                    Liquid.      By Sir William Thomson.
     In   a closed vessel containing only a liquid and its vapour, all at
 one temperature,          the liquid rests, with its free surface raised or
 depressed in capillary tubes and in the neighbourhood of the solid
 boundary, in permanent equilibrium according to the same law of

G4                           Proceedings of               the   Royal Society
relation between curvature and pressure                                 as in vessels open to           the
air.  The permanence of this equilibrium implies physical equi
librium between the liquid and the vapour in contact with it at all
parts of its surface. But the pressure of the vapour at different
levels differs according to hydrostatic law.                                 Hence the pressure          of
saturated          vapour in contact with a liquid differs according to the
curvature of the bounding                        surface,        being less when the liquid is
concave,          and greater when              it is convex.           And     detached    portions     of
the    liquid in separate vessels all enclosed in one containing vessel,
cannot remain permanently with their free surfaces                                       in any other
relative positions than those they would occupy                                  if there were    hydro
static communication                     of pressure            between     the portions of liquid
in the several                vessels.      There           must be evaporation from those
surfaces          which are too high, and condensation into the liquid at
those        surfaces        which are too low — a process which goes on until
hydrostatic equilibrium,                   as   if    with free communication of pressure
from vessel to vessel, is attained.                             Thus, for example,         if   there   are
two large open vessels              of water, one considerably above the other
in level, and           if   the temperature of the surrounding matter is kept
rigorously constant, the liquid in the higher vessel will gradually
evaporate          until it is all         gone and condensed                 into the lower vessel.
Or     if,   as   illustrated by the annexed diagram,                        a   capillary tube, with
a    small quantity of liquid occupying                            it   from its bottom up to a
certain level, be placed in the neighbourhood of                                   a   quantity of the
same         liquid with       a   wide free surface, vapour will gradually become
condensed           into the liquid in the capillary tube until the level                                of
the liquid in         it     is   the same           as   it   would be were the lower end of
the tube           in hydrostatic communication                         with the large mass              of
liquid.           Whether          air be present above                   the free surface         of the
liquid in the several                    vessels          or not, the condition            of ultimate
equilibrium          is       the same; but the processes                       of evaporation and
condensation through                      which equilibrium                is   approached  will be
very much retarded by the presence                                 of air.      The experiments of
Graham, and the kinetic theory of Clausius and Maxwell, scarcely
yet afford us sufficient data for estimating the rapidity with which
the vapour proceeding from one of the liquids will diffuse itself
through the air and reach the surface of another liquid at lower                                  a
level. With air at anything approaching to ordinary atmospheric

density to resist the process,     it is probable it would    be too slow to
show any results unless      in very long continued experiments.          But
if the  air be removed     as perfectly as can be done by well-known
practical methods,      it is probable that the      process    will be very
rapid:   it would, indeed,    be instantaneous, were     it not for the cold
of evaporation     in one  vessel   and the heat    of condensation in the
other.     Practically,   then,   the rapidity    of the    process  towards
hydrostatic equilibrium through vapour between             detached liquids,
 depends on the rate of the conduction of heat between the several
 surfaces through intervening       solids and liquids.     Without having
                                       n
  made either the experiment, or any calculations on the rate          of con
  duction   of heat in the circumstances,      I  feel convinced that in a
  very short time water would visibly rise in the capillary tube indi
  cated in the diagram, and that, provided care is taken to maintain
  equality   of temperature all over the surface of the hermetically
  sealed  vessel, the liquid in the capillary tube would soon take very
  nearly the same level as      it would have    were   its lower end open    ;
  sinking to this level if the capillary tube were in the beginning filled
  too full, or rising to it if (as indicated in the diagram) there is not
  enough of liquid in it at first to fulfil the condition of equilibrium.

     The following     formulae      show     precisely the relations between
curvatures, differences of level, and differences of pressure, with
 which we are concerned.
     Let p be the density     of the liquid, and a that of the vapour ; and
 let  T be the cohesive tension      of the free surface, per unit of breadth,
 in terms of weight of unit mass,              as  unit of force.    Let  h denote
 the height   of any point, P, of the        free surface above a certain plane
 of reference,   which    I  shall call for brevity the plane level of the
 free surface.    This will be sensibly the actual level of the free
surface in regions,      if there    are any, with       no part of the edge (or
bounding     line of the free surface where liquid ends and solid
begins) at a less distance than several centimetres.                    Lastly, let
r  and r' be the principal        radii of curvature of the surface at            P.
By Laplace's well-known            law, we have, as the equation of equi
librium,
                           <p-<r)A-T(-            +        .     .     .     (1).

Now, in the space occupied by vapour, the pressure is less at the
higher than at the lower of two points whose difference of levels is h,
by a difference equal to ah. And there is permanent equilibrium
between vapour and liquid at all points of the free surface.                Hence
the pressure    of vapour in equilibrium is less at a concave than at a
plane surface of liquid, and less at a plane surface than at a con-
vex surface, by differences amounting to

vapour of the same liquid at the same temperature presenting a

    In strictness, the value of       cr to be used in these        equations, (1)
and (2), ought to be the mean density of a vertical column of
vapour, extending through the height h from the plane                of reference.

But in all cases to which we can practically apply the formulae,
according to present knowledge                         of      the properties            of matter,         the

    For vapour of             water at ordinary atmospheric temperatures,                                H is
about 1,300,000 centimetres.                       Hence, in a capillary                        tube which
would keep water up to a height of 13 metres                                         above          the plane
level, the curved surface of the water is in equilibrium with the
vapour in contact with                 it,   when the pressure of the vapour   less                    is
 by   about ysVirth of its own                amount than the pressure of vapour in
equilibrium          at   a   plane surface of water at the same temperature.
    For water the value of             T     at ordinary temperatures                     is   about '08 of
a   gramme weight per centimetre                       ;       and p, being              the mean        of   a
cubic centimetre, in grammes,                     is   unity.            The value of a for vapour
 of water, at any atmospheric temperature,                                is    so small that we may
 neglect  altogether in equation (1).
            it                                                 In   a    capillary tube thoroughly
 wet with water, the free surface                          is   sensibly hemispherical,                     and
 therefore     r   and    r'   are each equal to the radius of the inner surface
 of the liquid film lining the tube above the free liquid surface; we
 have, therefore,
                                             h   = -08     x    -   .

 Hence,     if   h   = 1300     centimetres,       r   = 00012            centimetres.              There can
 be no doubt but that Laplace's theory                              is   applicable without serious
 modification         even to     a    case      in which the curvature    so great (or    is
 radius of curvature             so small) as this.        But in the present state of
 our knowledge we are not entitled to push                                  it   much further.       The
 molecular forces assumed in Laplace's theory to be
                                                                                          " insensible at
 sensible     distances,"         are certainly            but little,          if   at all, sensible at
 distances equal to or exceeding the wave lengths of ordinary light.
 This   isdirectly proved by the most cursory observation of soap

G8                      Proceedings       of the Royal Society
bubbles.          But the   appearances        presented     by the black spot which
abruptly       ends     the series of colours at places where the bubble
is thinnest        before   it breaks, make it quite certain that the action
of   those    forces becomes sensible at distances not much less than a
half    wave      length, or      j-jItit °'     a centimetre.        There     is,   indeed,
much and multifarious evidence that in ordinary solids and liquids,
not merely the distances of sensible inter-molecujar action, but the
linear dimensions           of the molecules themselves, and the average
distance from centre to nearest centre,* are but very moderately
small    in       comparison      with the         wave  of light.
                                                           lengths Some
approach to         a   definite estimate of the dimensions of molecules
is   deducible from Clausius' theory of the average spaces travelled
without       collision                          Maxwell's theory
                            by molecules of gases,              and
and experiments regarding the viscosity of gases.          Having
perfect confidence in the substantial reality of  the views which
these grand investigations               have opened        to us,  I   find   it     scarcely
possible to admit that there can be as many as 10" molecules in
a   cubic centimetre of liquid carbonic acid or of water.                      This makes
the average        distance from centre to nearest centre in the liquids
exceed    a   thousand-millionth          of   a   centimetre   !
  We cannot, then, admit that the formulas which        have given      I
above are applicable to express the law of equilibrium between the
moisture retained by vegetable substances,                      such as cotton cloth or
oatmeal, or wheat-flour              biscuits,      at temperatures       far above         the
dew point   of the surrounding atmosphere.       But although the
energy of the attraction of some of these substances for vapour
of water (when, for example, oatmeal, previously dried at high                         a
temperature, has been used, as in the original experiment of Sir J.
Leslie, to produce the freezing of water under the receiver of an air-
pump),       is   so great that     it    might almost claim recognition                   from

fibrous and cellular            organic    structures      is   a   property of matter

      5.    On a Bow seen on the Surface of Ice.                            By   J.   Clerk
                           Maxwell, Esq., F.R.SS. L. & E.
     On the 26th of January, about noon,                   I observed        the appearance
of    a coloured       bow on the frozen surface of the ditch which sur
rounds S.          John's College, Cambridge.             Its   appearance       and position
seemed       to correspond with those of an ordinary primary rainbow.
I   at once made a rough measurement of the angle on the board of
a book      which      I had       with me, and then borrowed from                Dr Parkin
son, President of S. John's College, a sextant, with which                             I found
that the angle between the bright red and the shadow of the large
mirror was           41° 50', and that for       bright blue         40° 30'. The anglo
for the extreme red of the primary bow, as                          given in Parkinson's
Optics, is 42° 20', and that for violet 40° 32'.                     The bows formed by
ice crystals are seen on the same side as the sun, and not on the
opposite side.             I   suppose    the bow which         I   saw to be formed by
small       drops of water lying on the ice.                        If    the lower part of
each  drop          were    flattened, so as to        bring the point at which the
reflexion takes place nearer to the points of incidence and emer
gence, the effect would be of the same kind as that of a diminution
of the index of refraction — that    the angle of the bow would be
                                                 is,
increased.           How       a   drop of water can lie upon ice without wetting
it,   and losing its shape altogether,          I      do not profess to explain.
     Only    a     small part of the ice presented this appearance.                       It   was
best seen when the incident and emergent rays were nearly equally
inclined to the horizontal.                 The ice     was very         thin, and
                                                                                 I     was not
able to get near enough to the place where the bow appeared                                     to
see   if    the supposed water drops really existed.

1.   Note on the Atomic Volume of Solid Substances.                   By
      James Dewar, Lecturer on Chemistry, Veterinary Col
       lege, Edinburgh.
    The investigation of   the volume retained by different elementary
substances,     when combined in the solid condition,       has attracted
the attention of many chemists.          We   have  only to look at the
laborious memoirs of Schroter, Kopp, Playfair and Joule, Boullay,
Filhol, and others, to    be convinced   of the great amount of labour
expended on the subject. Nor is it at all remarkable that so many
workers should take to this field of research, when we remember
the simplicity of the laws regulating        the combining    volumes   of
gaseous substances,     and the probable extension  of some such  similar
law to the solid condition of matter.       Emboldened by analogy, the
forementioned workers endeavoured to find some constant to which
volumes of elements and compounds held the relation of some
simple multiple, and thus extend the apparent simplicity of Prout's
law of combining weights to combining volumes.          The great object
in view was evidently to extend the speculations and laws of Dalton
and Gay Lussac to the volumes of solid substances, and thus to
arrive at some general explanation of the results.       However credit
able the desire to reveal    simplicity from out of the apparent chaos,
no one,   in examining the subject,   can help arriving at the conclusion
 that the means employed to extract the seeming harmony from the
results were purely arbitrary.       It  does not follow,  however, that
 the results were fruitless,    although    no great generalisation   was
 discovered.     The solid state of matter is relatively far more com
 plicated than either the liquid or gaseous conditions.         The uni
 formity of expansion of gaseous matter, and the easy comparison
of liquid substances under similar conditions, enable us to arrive
 at some     satisfactory conclusions regarding the volume in these
 states:   but,  in examining solid matter, we have no guarantee

 that the substances       are under similar physical       conditions.    We
 cannot, therefore, expect the same uniformity in the results            ; but
 although, strictly speaking, we may entertain grave doubt on the
  real value of the results, yet, in some cases, we cannot help recog
  nising   Bome curious      analogies, especially   on   comparing    similar
 classes of compounds.         It is not the object of this note either to
  criticise or discuss the labours        and   speculations   of others, no
 originality being claimed in the subject matter itself, all that is
 original being merely the addition of a few new analogies.
     The first important discovery in the subject of atomic volumes
  was made by Schroter.         He observed that the equivalent volume
 of oxygen, obtained by subtracting the volume of metal in the free
 state from the volume of the oxide, gave, approximately,            the same
  value of  5 2  in the oxides of copper, zinc, cadmium, lead, mercury,
  iron, cobalt, and titanium.     In other words, the oxygen occupied      the
  same voII,Tne    in each combination.      Other classes of oxides gave a
  volume of twice, or half the above number.            In order  to arrive at
  the volume of the oxygen, Schroter started with the premises that
  the metal in the combined state occupied the same volume as the
  uncombined      metal.    Granting, for the present, that oxygen has
  a definite volume in combination in the oxides, it is clear that the
  volume obtained by difference         will vary with the volume of the
 combined     metal.     The   same   method applied to the oxides of the
  less dense metals would give a negative volume to the oxygen                 ;
 and in these       cases we   must admit condensation        to have taken
  place in the metal itself.        'We may have three cases, therefore,
  according    as   the volume     of the combined       metal  differs  from
  that of the uncombined.          If  it remains the     same  in combina
  tion,   we obtain    the real volume;      if it condenses, the volume
  is a minimum;         if it  expands, a maximum.          Seeing that the
  oxygen in the dense metals has the volume 5'2,             we may regard
  the greater and smaller volume obtained from some oxides as the
 result of condensation or expansion of the metal.            Supposing the
 above volume (5-2) to exist generally in the oxides, we would
 have a condensation in the less dense metals in combination,
 approaching very nearly, in the case of potassium, sodium, and
aluminium, to one-third, and in calcium, magnesium, and strontium
to nearly one-half, of the volume in the free state.                Thus far,

 then, this cumber would give a rough explanation                    in admitting
 condensation in many of the metals.
    I  have thought       that it would be interesting           to compare this
 volume with the volume of oxygen when it is combined with solid
substances other than metallic, und to take a series of analogous
combinations.         For this    purpose   the chlorine family is well fitted
in their respective combinations with potassium, and these with
oxygen.         The following table contains the best known density
determinations        and   volumes of chloride, bromide, and iodide               of
potassium, compared with the densities of chlorate, bromate, and

The total volume of the oxygen in chlorate of potash, on the sup
position the chloride of potassium retains its original volume in
combination, is 15; whereas it is only 7 in bromate of potash, if
we allow that the bromide         of potassium retains its original volume ;
and    it  appears   to occupy no volume       in iodate of potash, assuming
that iodide of potassium maintains its original volume.                         The
apparent disappearance of the volume of the oxygen, in changing
iodide of potassium into iodate, is analogous to the apparent loss
of volume of many salts in their water of hydration, the salt occu
pying the volume of the crystal water taken as ice, as pointed out
many years ago by Playfair and Joule.               It  is clear that, in assum
ing the halogen compounds of potassium as retaining their primi
tive volume in their oxidised derivatives, we place these compound
substances      in the  same position as the metals         in the simple oxides.
Now, we saw that in many oxides the volume of the oxygen
varied, and that, in all probability, from metallic condensation
taking place during the act of combination.                  The metals having
the   lowest density and the greatest atomic volume condense the
most in combining.              Generally speaking, if we examine the

 volumes of the halogen salts in the above table, it is clear that
 the equivalent      volumes increase, chloride of potassium being 37,
  bromide 44, and iodide 55'3, and their relative stability diminishes.
  The equivalent volumes of chlorine, bromine, and iodine are iden
  tical in the liquid state; and thus the formation of the respective
  potassium compounds is one of the results of unequal condensa
  tion, the co-efficient of contraction           in the formation of chloride of
   potassium being (H6, bromide 0 29, iodide 0'23 per unit volume.
   Their formation is attended with the evolution of very different
  amounts of heat.         The following table contains some of the con

     Generally speaking, the number found for bromide of potassium
  is nearly the mean of those attached to chloride and iodide.                             A
  similar observation       has recently been            made by   M. Yalsen in exa
  mining the equivalent capillary constants of                these      bodies.     Look
  ing at the atomic thermal number, there is a far greater likelihood
 of condensation taking place in the bromide and iodide of potassium
  in the combined       state,    than     in  case     of chloride, seeing that it
  would    be relatively far more       difficult to condense. But neither the
  chlorate, bromate, nor iodate can be produced through                       the direct
  addition     of oxygen to the respective halogen salt.                        And the
  chlorate, it is well known, evolves heat on giving off its oxygen,
  and thus necessitates an absorption of heat during combination.
 It  is just possible that the heat produced during the decomposition
 is the   result of the necessary expansion of volume in the chloride
 of potassium in combining with oxygen, and its return to its
normal volume on losing it. It makes no change in volume to
suppose that, in the one case, the oxygen is added as a whole to
the chloride of potassium, or, in the other, that it is between the

74                Proceedings     of the Royal Society
potassium     and chlorine,    each occupying      its individual volume
unchanged, but     it would alter greatly the heat evolved in      so doing.
If  oxygen combined with chloride of          potassium as a whole,    with
out any condensation taking place, the natural result would be an
evolution   of heat.    But  if the  addition of the oxygen diminishes
the co-efficient of contraction, as compared        with that of the    free
compound, then we have a physical           explanation   of the evolution
of heat on decomposition.        In this  case the actual work performed
by the condensation of oxygen is retained in a potential form, and,
therefore, reappears as heat on its decomposition.             If, now,   we
examine the mode in which the oxygen is attached to the respec
tive halogen compounds, we can trace, as a necessary consequence,
the retention of varying       amounts of energy.       Chlorate, bromate,
and iodate of potash are formed by a similar            chemical reaction,
according to the following formula of exchange, given in equiva
lents, the whole reaction supposed to take place in the presence of
water  : —
               6KO     +    6C1     =   5KC1     +    KCIO,

We have appended the thermal equivalents attending the for
mation of these bodies in a large volume of water.               It will be
obvious on comparing the formation of chlorate of potash, through
the above reaction, that it may be the result of absorption of heat;
whereas   it is certain that the formation of iodate of potash must
be  attended with an evolution of heat, or else cold must be the
result of their action.      In special experiments, made with the
object of determining      the thermal action, neither absorption nor
evolution of heat could be detected.         Thus the formation of iodate
of potash is attended with an      evolution of heat. This would, then,
accord with the easy transformation of the chlorates into iodates, or
of chloric acid into iodic acid, and the easy transformation of the
iodide of potassium into the iodate, through the action of perman
ganate of potash, seeing that we must have an evolution of heat.

possible explanation ; he is also well aware that many other ex
planations might be given, all, possibly, equally satisfactory.   But
a physical explanation, however far it may lie from the truth,
seems to convey to us           the clearest ideas of what may possibly take
place.
   There is one point connected  with the subject of volumes that
requires very careful attention.   All bodies in combining do not
unite with condensation ; that                   is,
                                     the volume of the compound
might exceed the volumes                   of the isolated constituents, and yet              a
large evolution of heat might take place during                        its formation.         A
well-known         example       is   that of iodide of silver.            Now, M. Fizeau
has shown that iodide of silver contracts regularly with increase of
temperature, and M. St Claire Deville has given an explanation of
this anomaly.             Deville believes that bodies combine at such                        a
temperature as would be required to transform                         the volume of the
compound to that of the sum of the volumes of its constituents in
the free state. Applying this to iodide of silver,        clear that        it   is
contraction must take place, and in all similar cases where we have
an increase        of volume.         One cannot help associating this increase
of volume to a purely physical change of state, such as the change
of water with expansion into ice.         Now, as Sir William Thomson
has proven         that pressure lowers the freezing point of water, and
Mousson         has actually       liquefied ice by enormous pressure,                  if   the
formation         of a chemical compound                    is   analogous to     a   physical
change        of state,   we ought to be able by mere                 pressure to decom
pose   chemical compound,
         a                    the formation of that compound
                                           if                                                 is
attended with an  increase of volume. No doubt, in order to get
experimental          proof of this fact,         we must use          a   relatively     weak
chemical compound, one attended with the evolution of no great
amount        of heat; and the well-known experiments of Joule                          on the
effect      of pressure on      amalgams,       seems to confirm           my anticipation.
Joule has shown that the                   amalgams         of zinc, lead, and tin      are de
composed by pressure alone, and these are the amalgams produced
with the least contraction of any.                     In   order to get definite proof of

the expansion, it           is,     of course, necessary to use the specific gravity
of mercury in the solid                   state.       Now, Joule states, as the mean                           of
his experiments, that mercury in the solid form has the specific
gravity 15-19, whereas in the above amalgams     would have the                     it
density of only 141.                      The observations of Matthiessen                             on   the
specific gravity of alloys enables us to confirm Joule's results                                       :   —

The specific gravity of the mercury used in calculating                                           the mean
density was 13-573.                  Now, seeing that there                       is    little or no con
traction, and even in one case     slight expansion, in taking the
                                                       a
above specific gravity of mercury, the higher density of mercury
given by Joule as the result of his experiments would necessarily
lead to an expansion in their formation.   To illustrate the effect
of pressure     on the composition                     of   an amalgam, let us take                   Joule's
experiments         on the tin amalgam.                               The         composition         of this
amalgam was 100 of mercury to 51-01                                      of tin, and the specific
gravity      10-518.        The effect of 5400 lbs.                        pressure       for thirty days,
changed the amalgam, so that                         it     had ultimately               the composition
100       of mercury to             384 of    tin.         It   is   natural to believe, therefore,
that the effect of pressure                      in this        case    is   quite analogous to the
inverse change of state, when                      a   body that has expanded in chang
ing its     state has been subjected to its influence.
     In   the early part of this paper we saw that the volume of oxygen
in some oxides, instead of being                            5
                                                            2,       was sometimes double                  this
amount, or even more.                       It     has      also been remarked, that                  if   the
metal in combining                   was to expand,                  the volume of the oxygen
would appear as             a       maximum.               This apparently large volume of
the   oxygen seems to belong to sub-oxides, such as sub-oxides                                                  of
mercury and copper, and oxide of silver.                                  If   we suppose, now, that
this large increase of volume in the oxygen                                        is   the result of an
expansion in the metal in combining with the normal oxide,                                                 it   is

possible that mere pressure     would decompose              these oxides, at least
in part, into metal      and the   higher oxide. The instability of a
body of this type, such as        sub-oxide of mercury, is well known,
mere    titration effecting the   liberation of metal with formation of
the higher oxide.       In this way, therefore, it           seems to support the
argument adduced.
2.    Note on Inverted Sugar.              By James Dewar, Lecturer                 on
              Chemistry, Veterinary College, Edinburgh.
     For some time past an animated discussion has been going on in
 the columns of the        " Comptes Rendus         de 1'Academie des Sciences"
 between      MM. Dubranfaut and Maumene regarding                 the nature of in
 verted sugar.       M. Dubranfaut, many         years ago, made many valuable
 additions to our knowledge concerning the composition and reac
 tions     of various     sugars, especially in explaining the result of the
 action of dilute acids on cane sugar.          He explained the levo-rotatory
 action      of inverted sugar,      and  its rapidly varying       power with the
 temperature, as the result of          a molecule    of water    in reacting with
 a  molecule of cane sugar, generating one molecule of glucose and
 one of lrevulose.        Dubranfaut believed that inverted sugar consisted
 of a mixture of glucose and larvulose in equal weights;               and although
  he did not make a direct analysis of the product, yet                he was    justly
 entitled to assume that it was          so constituted, seeing that, generally,
 it agreed with a mean of the properties of inulin sugar and dex
  trose.
      In order     to support the      above view,     he separated      levo-glucose
  from the inverted        sugar, through the      insolubility of the lime com
  pound, and       compared     its properties with pure laevulose.          The de
  composition would, according to Dubranfaut, be                as  follows  : —
                      Cl5HaOn     + H2O    =  CM         +  C„H,A
                        + 73-8                +56            -106
                                                    (-25)
      So   thoroughly had his       facts and explanations       been accepted       by
   chemists generally,        that, up till   a recent     date, no one discovered
   any flaw     in his researches,     and therefore    no   doubt was thrown on
   the validity of this theory.          Recently,   Maumene has reinvestigated
       7<iL.  VTI.                                                             L

78                    Proceedings      of the Royal Society
the composition of inverted sugar by analysis.                 He has attempted
to separate the two sugars through the action              of chloride of sodium.
The dextro-glucose forms a well-defined crystalline compound with
chloride of sodium, whereas the laevulose does not form any com
pound.       The results obtained by this method differ greatly from
theory.      Instead of finding 50 per cent. of leevulose, he found 88 per
cent.     In repeating the experiments of Dubranfaut             on the separation
 of levo-glucose by hydrate of lime,             he has not met with any better
 results   ; in fact, his results are quite opposed to those of Dubranfaut.
     Apart altogether from expressing               an opinion   on the merits     of
 the   views entertained by the different parties to this discussion,
 the author has thought            some    observations of the same         subject
 might not      be unworthy     of notice     at the present time.
     Linneman,       many years ago, applied the process of hydrogenation               .
 to the sugars that he had found so successful in treating the simple
 organic substances.          In the way named         he obtained mannite from
 inverted sugar, the following reaction taking place               : —
                             CAA        +  H,    = C,H,4O,-
  Mannite     bad    long been known to be the product of certain kinds
  of fermentation, and occurring          as a secondary product in the vinous
  fermentation     ;  but it was this elegant synthesis of Linneman that
  first clearly showed the connection.               But although inverted sugar
  can   be changed into        mannite, the next point that demands           a solu
  tion is the proving the inverted sugar to be composed                    of   equal
  quantities of dextrose and laevulose.             Are they both transformed by
  hydrogenation        into mannite?       or   is only one of them, and which?
   Linneman      seems     to have    directed his attention       to the solution
  of this question.          He  states   that it is only the laevulose      that is
   so affected.      The reasons why he entertains           the  above   views are
   not given.      In all likelihood       he thought     that, just   as Berthelot
   had   changed mannite by         a  peculiar fermentation into levo-glucose,
   so would the levo-glucose          in inverted sugar be hydrogenised into
   mannite.
      In   repeating the action of sodium amalgam on inverted sugar, I
   have not seen any reason why the one sugar any more than the other
   should be supposed         to generate      the mannite.     The following is      a
   description of     the mode by which the sugar was inverted and hydro

 adding one gramme of sodium in the form of a weak amalgam.
 The action took place without                any evolution       of hydrogen.          If
 the amalgam was impure, from the presence                       of other metals, it
 evolved hydrogen at once, and the solution became brown                        ;  other
 wise it remained perfectly clear.                After    one month      the solution
 gave no trace of sugar with              the alkaline copper solution.            It was
 then carefully          neutralised with dilute sulphuric          acid, evaporated
 on the water bath, the greater part of the sulphate of sodium
 separated by crystallisation,            and the residue treated with boiling
 70 per cent. alcohol, the solution               filtered, and     allowed to crys
 tallise.       Sometimes the mannite did not crystallise                 until all    the
 alcohol       had   evaporated,    leaving   a syrup that slowly assumed the
 crystalline        form.     The product had no rotatory power.                   In   no
 case was       the sugar entirely changed into mannite — a gummy                     sub
 stance was invariably           left, that would not crystallise          after expo
 sure to the air for months.                Mannitan,       or some     similar     body,
  may be one         of the products.
     Dextro-glucose         made    from honey gave          mannite     when     treated
  in the      same way, having exactly the same melting                 point as ordi
 nary mannite.            In treating milk sugar with dilute sulphuric acid,
 changing into gallactose and hydrogenising,                    dulcite    was not iso
  lated  ;  but    I  have not specially studied the reaction.

     The conditions of        a steady flow    of electricity in   a conducting sur
  face are completely          determined,     if  we know either the nature of
 the electrical distribution          throughout the surface, or the direction
 and   intensity of the flow         at every point.       On the first of these ways
of considering the question, the problem                 is solved  if we can express
the potential         v  at any point    as a function of the co-ordinates,            and

     From the           second point       of view,           we should                endeavour to deter
mine the lines of flow by equations of the form

   The curves determined by equations (1) and (2) are obviously
orthogonal, and since
we know, by a theorem                    of Lame           unci    Stokes,* that

Kirchhoff, in the year 1845, took up the problem for plane surfaces f
in the first of          the two ways we have                     indicated.            By        an application
of Ohm's law,            ho expressed          analytically                 the conditions to be satis
fied by v.            When the electricity enters and issues by                                    a    number of
individual points,             he found (apparently                  by trial) that an integral
of the form 2(a log     where      r),                r,     r2, &c., are the distances of the
point (x,  from  the
                 y)  successive                         points of entrance and issue, satis
fies these        conditions when the plate                       is   infinite.         For      a    finite plate,
it   is   necessary       that the boundary of the plate should be orthogonal
to the curves
                                                             = const.
                                         2(a log       r)                          .          .         .       (3).
     He was thus led to form the orthogonal curves,                                           who.se equation
be gives in the form
                                         2(a   [r,    R])     = const.             .          .         .       (4),
where       [r,   It]   is   the angle between                r        and      a fixed line R.                 These
equations he applies to the case of                                   a     circular     plate, completely
determining the curves when there                                 is   one      exit and           one      entrance
point in the circumference, and showing that in any case proper                                             a
number of subsidiary points would make the equipotential lines
determined by (3), cut the circumference at right angles.                                                       Kirch -

hofTs paper fc throughout           properly busied with the function           v, and
the stream lines are only dealt with incidentally.                        There is no
 attempt to give      a physical meaning to the equation (4).
     In 1848, Thomson drew attention to the orthogonal systems (3)
 and (4), as an example of Lame's theorem.*                      He showed that the
 rings and brushes of biaxal crystals are a special case of these curves.
  They correspond, in fact,       as we shall see, to the equipotential           lines
  and lines of flow in an infinite            plate with two equal sources            of
  electricity.
     Maxwell. in       1856,    suggested the application             to problems of
 electric currents of his beautiful theory of the motion of an imma
 terial incompressible fluid in       a  resisting medium, but does not appear
 to have developed       the suggestion.t
     The object of this paper is to show that, by regarding, in accor
 dance with Maxwell's suggestion, every point of exit or issue as a
  source or sink, spreading or absorbing electricity,               independently of
  all other  sources,   Kirchhoff    s  general equations may be deduced by
  easy geometrical processes, and extended to certain cases of flow
  in curved surfaces.        We shall, by this method,           be naturally  led to
  look mainly at the function u, which in the analytical investigation
  is subordinated to     v.    The equation      u  =    0  will  receive  an obvious
  physical interpretation,       and we shall      then proceed        to consider in
 detail the nature of the flow in certain special cases apparently not
 yet examined.
     If a source  P, in     an  infinite uniformly resisting plate, steadily
  give forth a quantity of electricity E per unit of time, the flow per
  second over the whole circumference of all circles with P as centre is
  equal.    Hence the rate of flow at each point of the circumference of
 such a circle is inversely as the radius =            -E—  .     The potential due
                                                       Z1TT

    The equation of       the lines   of flow follows at         once from the equa
tion of continuity.         Across any element ds of a stream                  line   sub
tending     angles d$, dd.lt &c., at the sources,               and   eZ6\' d&J, &c. at
sinks, no fluid must flow.            But the quantity of fluid per                second
reaching ds from P« is                 E.       The quantity withdrawn             by P'„
is         E.   Hence the differential equation of the stream-line is
                                  *16   -    S.de'   = 0 .
Integrating,                        16   -    23'  =   const.
where     6 and  ff are the angles between radii vectores and any fixed
lines.     If we   agree to reckon       6    in opposite directions for sources
and sinks, the equation becomes
                                       25    = a          .      .      .    .      (6).
    The following are elementary consequences of this equation :—
    (a.) When we have one source P and one equal sink P', the
stream line through any point Q has for its equation
                  261  =  QPP'    +  QP'P        =  j-      PQP'    = a.
Hence the locus of Q is a circle through                  P  and   P', which    is Kirch-
hoff's case.      The orthogonals are circles whose                 centres (R) lie in
PP'     produced,    and whose radii         =  VPR.P'R.
    (6.)  If  we have two equal sources and no sinks,                    or what is the

same       thing, sinks       at an   infinite     distance, the    stream    lines are
 rectangular hyperbolas.            For in this     case,

 touches the circle through PP'Q, therefore
                                    QNa   =   NF .    NP
   —   the equation of         a  rectangular      hyperbola through       P and P',
  whose centre is the middle point of                 PP',   and which     is referred
  to conjugate         diameters inclined         at angle a.       The orthogonal
  system in this case consists of the lemniscates rr1                    = c.    One of
  the hyperbolas consists of the straight line              PP',  and the line equi
  distant from       P   and  P'.    Dividing     the plate along the latter line,
  we have the case         of one source in a plate bounded in one direction
  by an infinite straight line, but otherwise unlimited or bounded by
  a  lemniscate of infinite        conductivity, having        P and its image due
  to the boundary line for poles.
      (c.)  To find    the image of any point in a circular boundary, i.e. to
  find the source which in combination with                 a source    at the centre
  of the circle,     and an equal sink at any other point,             will make the
  circle    a stream   line.
     Let   A   be  the centre of the circle,        and  P  the given sink.       In AP
take P', so that AP.AP' = AQ\                          Then PAQ and          QAF     are
similar triangles, and QPA              =   AQP'    .
    Therefore QAP + QP'A + QPA                    =   2*, or (6) is satisfied for any
point in the circle by assuming               at  P'  a sink = P.
    (4.) Hence        if  there be within     a  circle m sources and n sinks, we

84                 Proceedings      of the Royal Society
must assume the same number of sources               and    sinks without       the
circle, and n   — m sources at the centre.
   (e.) The straight line equidistant       from two equal sources          of the
same    sign is clearly     a stream   line for these     points.    Hence the
image of any point in       a straight line is an equal point, which is its
optical image.
   I  have constructed the equation
                                     23 = a
on the assumption that all the sources are equal, because the degree
of the stream line is equal to the number of equal sources (positive
and negative) to which the system can be reduced.                 For   if h, k  be
the co-ordinates of P, the equation becomes

an equation of the n,h degree        if there be  in all  n sources.
   The degree of the equipotential lines is also           =  n  if there    be an
equal number of sources           and sinks.    In general, if there         be m
sources   of one sign, and n    — in of another, and   m > n - m, 2m is        the
degree    of the equipotential lines.        This is  one    of many features
which make it more convenient to work with stream lines.
   It  is obvious from equation (8), that every stream          line must pass
through all the sources.        Thus, the circle in case (c), which passes
through no source, is not       a  complete stream line, the other branch
being the straight line      APP', which    passes through all the sources.
Distinct   stream lines can intersect only at a source,         for at no other
point can 20 be indeterminate.           Where two branches of the same
stream line intersect the velocity is necessarily zero, changing sign
in passing through      the point.     The physical meaning of a branch
is that two streams        impinge, and are thrown off with an abrupt
change of direction.

    Thus the branches make equal angles with                        each    other.     This
proposition depends solely on the relation                v«    = 0.      It   is therefore
true, also, for the equipotential lines, as is otherwise obvious.*
    The general nature of the           stream     lines will be different, accord
ing   as   the number of sinks is or is not equal to the number of
sources.      In the former        case,   2(0) = 0 is satisfied at all points
infinitely distant,       the radii being all parallel, and the positive
and negative angles equal in number.                      Hence        one    stream    line
has the straight line at       infinity  as a branch, or intersects the straight
line at infinity at right angles, and therefore has an asymptote.
This    stream line    will, in general,    be of the n    — 1th
                                                                      degree.      In some
cases    it may   be of a lower degree       ;  as,  for example, when the conic
at infinity is its other branch.               A  case of this sort        will   be given
below.       The other     stream   lines of the system cannot meet the line
at infinity, and cannot have asymptotes.                    However far they run
out, they must therefore loop and return.
    "When     there are more sources           than sinks, 20 becomes              indeter
minate at an infinite distance, as might have been anticipated from
the fact, that in this case there is a constant flow of electricity out
wards,     implying    a sink at an    infinite distance.         The line at infinity
is not in this case a stream line, and               will be    cut by all the stream
lines, which do not loop except at finite distances, and have all
asymptotes.
    The asymptotes, in this case, may                be easily constructed by the
aid of equations (6) and (8).
    At the infinitely distant point of contact the velocities due                          to
all sources      are  in the     same direction,       or the asymptote must be
parallel to the radii.
    If   there are m sources and n          —   m sinks, the stream line whose
asymptote makes an angle a with the initial line is obviously

   *  I have   since found that this result has been already proved for plane
curves by Professor Rankine and Professor Stokes             (Proc. R.S., 1867), and for
spherical harmonics by Sir W. Thomson and Professor Tait, in their treatise
on Natural Philosophy.

   So that each stream line has 2m           - n asymptotes    equally inclined
to one another.
   Transforming to rectangular co-ordinates,               and    choosing      the
asymptote as axis of x, (8) reduces to
                                                              = 0.

   Hence the asymptote        is such that the algebraic sum          of the per
pendiculars from the sources diminished by the sum of the perpen
diculars from the sinks is zero.             It  is obvious without       analysis
that this condition     is necessary, that the velocity perpendicular            to
the asymptote, at its point of contact with the curve, may be absolute
zero.   If  sinks weigh upward, all lines passing through the centre
of gravity of the system are asymptotes, and 2m — n of these lines,
equally inclined to each other, belong to one stream line.                     The
system must have a centre of gravity,              for by pairing sources and
sinks we produce couples which will always give a single resultant
when compounded with the weights of the extra sources.
   A complete system has no centre of gravity, but (14) is satisfied
for all lines perpendicular to the axis of the resultant couple. If
the axis of the couple formed by pairing a source and sink at dis
tance p„ makes an angle        \fpm with the axis of the resultant couple

point, and   has contact of the third order, or x has three roots = oo .
   The condition for this is obviously —

      this case not only 3(db    =   but 2(zfc   = 0. Hence (16)

no longer gives    fixed point on the asymptote, but only fixes its
                          a
direction.         A   further analytical               condition           is   easily found, but         is
unnecessary.           For in this         of gravity of the sources
                                           case the centre
coincides with the centre of gravity of the sinks. The stream lines
due to the sources alone would have the same sets of asymptotes
as those due to sinks.                One of these sets                is   necessarily asymptotic
in the complete system, which                            has       always one line with                   real
asymptotes.            The      set   will consist of              -   rays, all passing through
                                                                   a
the common centre               of gravity of the              sources and sinks, and equally
inclined to one another.
     Rectilineal Branches are asymptotes coinciding with their curves.
      Hence, in an incomplete system, all straight lines pass through
the centre         of gravity of         the system,          and belong to one stream line,
unless the centre of gravity be                         a   source.          In any         case they are
equally inclined              to one another, for              if   not branches of one stream
line, they would be so for the system got by removing the source
at their intersection.
      In    a   complete system there can be only one rectilineal stream line,
    unless sinks and sources have                a     common centre of gravity.                     In    the
                                                        n
    latter case, there can be at most                       straight        lines, forming           equally
                                                        ^
    inclined rays through that point.
      The condition            for   a   rectilineal          branch     is      in general that           the
    sources      must be either on the line or be two by two, each other's
    images on the line.              For   if   not, remove all the sources on the line
    and all pairs of sources which are each other's images in the line.
    Next, remove all          sources            of the line by placing equal
                                           on one side
    sources      of opposite sign at the place of their images   The straight
    line    is   stilla  stream line, and   on  one side of     there are no           it
    sources,     and therefore constant potential, which                              is   absurd.     Simi
    larly   it   can be shown that           a        circle   is  a   possible stream           line only
    when the sources            are on the curve or image each                              other.     From
    this    it   follows that no finite number of sources can give parallel
    rectilineal streams or non-intersecting                        circular streams.

     A similar investigation applies to equipotential lines. The image
of   a point in a rectilineal equipotential line is the same in position
as    the image in a stream line, but of opposite sign.                                         No source
can lie on an equipotential                       line.       Hence, to show that for right
equipotential line the points must image two by two, we have only
to remove all sources on one side of the line, placing equal sources
of the same sign at their images. The line is still equipotential,
therefore we may suppose                   it charged to constant potential, and all
sources removed.            Hence all stream lines become rectilineal, which
is absurd.       Similarly if a circle is equipotential, the sources must
balance       about it two by two, i.e., must be in a straight line with
its centre, at distances to which the radius is mean proportional                                              —
otherwise we can find a system reducible                                  to a single       point at the
centre     of the circle,        and    in which all stream lines                     are rectilineal.
Hence, no incomplete                   system can             have a rectilineal or circular
potential line.

      The radius of curvature may be similarly expressed,                                         but such
expressions can hardly have                   a     practical application.
     The   cases   of practical interest              are     mainly those where the number
of sources      is   small.          We      have already examined the cases                            of two

00                 Proceedings       of the Royal Society
sources    of the  same    or opposite signs.           We will now proceed        to
consider the cases that arise when there are three or four sources.
   Three Sources.    — In general the curves will                be cubic    passing
through the three sources, and having asymptotes determined as
above.     The direction      of flow at any point of the field may                be
found by observing that           if p be the angle between             the tangent
and a radius vector,
                                       sinp     =   Q

It  will sometimes     be possible to find the direction of flow geometri
cally by the following obvious theorem.
    If a  circle be described touching         a stream     line  at any point, and
cutting off from     the  radii vectores of that point, fractions of their
lengths, /i fi, &c., where fi is negative if the point of intersection
is in the radius vector produced, and also negative if the radius
vector is drawn from a sink, then —
                                     30)    =   0.
    When the number of            sources   is large this       theorem is not in
 general convenient, but it is often applicable where there are only
three points.
    The lines of flow       can, however, be        readily described with any
 degree   of accuracy when there        is one sink, by describing segments
 of circles with constant difference of angle through the sink and
 one source, and drawing          through     the other source        straight  lines
 with the     same    difference of angle.           The stream lines will         be
 diagonals of the quadrilaterals into which the field is thus divided.
 The   process may be extended to the case of two sources                   and two
 sinks by taking the intersections of two sets of circles.
    When there     are two sources      and one sink, the singular             points
 may be found       by an      easy   geometrical        method.      Let A, B, be
 sources,   C the sink, and     P  a point   of zero velocity.        The resultant
 velocity due to    A  and C is in the tangent             to the circle   PAC, and
 also — since P   is a  singular point — in the line PB.              Therefore —
                                   BPC = PAC          .
 Similarly
                                   APC = PBC          .
 Hence    PCA, BCP       are  similar triangles,        and there are two points

     1.   Two Sources and a Sink.                             — The conic is always                   a circle with
the sink as centre.                        If the           sink lies in the line of             the sources pro
duced, the radius                   of the circle is                 a mean          proportional          to the dis
tances      of the sink from the sources.                                       If the   sink lie between the
sources, the circle is impossible.                                   If    the sink       is the vertex         of   an
isosceles       triangle,           the circle passes through both sources, and all
asymptotes meet in the point of zero flow furthest from the sources.
If the     sink is half way between the sources, there are two straight
lines and a real and impossible circle.
     2. Three           Sources            of        the     same      Sign. — Every stream line has
three asymptotes, meeting in the centre of gravity, and inclined at
angles of         -g-
                        .    If     one         of    these     asymptotes becomes                a    branch, the
other branch                is  a   hyperbola, with centre of gravity as centre, and
axes      in ratio of ^3                   to    1.         If the   points form an isosceles triangle,
the hyperbola passes through the extremities of the base.                                                       If the
triangle        is   equilateral, the hyperbola coincides with its asymptotes.
If the     vertical angle              is       less than         -g
                                                                       ,   the rectilineal         branch       is   the
transverse axis             ;    if   greater than                         it   is   the conjugate.            If    the
points are all in                 a   line, the vertices of the hyperbola                                  lie on that
line, and are the points of zero flow, which are easily found.                                                  If one
point      is   half way              between               the other two, we have                two rectilineal
branches and two hyperbolas, the conjugate axis of the one being
equal to the transverse axis of the other.                                               The hyperbolas             are,
therefore, confocal.

     Singular Points. — If                  P, A      and     B   are sources,         C   and D sinks, there
is   a singular point                 at    if              the circles      APC, BPD,            and also      APD,
BPC touch at P.                     Hence, there are no real singular                                 points   if    the
sides of the quadrilateral                            ACBD intersect, unless all the points                           be
on   a    circle, which in this case contains all the singular points.
     Straight Lines. — The one stream line which has an asymptote                                                     is

gravity          of sinks and             sources            shall coincide, i.e., that                          AB, CD           are
diagonals of           a      parallelogram.                 The asymptotes must                            meet       at       right
angles, and the hyperbola                              is     equilateral.                  It     is     obvious, indeed,
that in this case the sources and sinks give separately sets of con
centric rectangular hyperbolas, of which the one passing through
the four points                  belongs to both sets, and                              is       the only asymptotic

   It  is easily shown that the stream lines orthogonal to these are
lemniscates with the same centre, passing through the four points,
one  of which    becomes   a circle   when the parallelogram              is rectan
gular.
   The ellipse appears to be an impossible conic for four points,
for conies occur in pairs orthogonal to each other. The orthogonal
of the ellipse must     be a confocal      hyperbola, which          is impossible,
the only hyperbola being that discussed above.                  Orthogonal circles,
however, are possible, and fall under two classes, according as all
the points are on one circle, or two on each.
   If  ABCD lie on     a circle, that circle       is obviously a stream line.
Let BA.DC produced meet in 0. Then OA.OB = 00. OD, and
the circle, with centre O and radius ^/OA.OB is the other branch
of the stream line. If O lies within the circle ABCD, the second
circle   becomes    impossible.      If   CA.BD        produced       meet     R and
CB.AD in     S,  R and S     are   centres of equipotential            circles, only
one  of which is real, unless the      second      stream      circle is imaginary.
We may take      as an example the case         of   a rectangle, points of the
same sign    lying  on the same diagonal.           Let the circle through the
four points be (2a and 2b being the sides of the rectangle)
                         *2 +    ,f - a" -     6' = 0      .
The other branch is the imaginary circle
                         x*  +   y> + a* +     62  = 0     ;
and we know that another stream           line is the hyperbola
                          ,f  - x' -    a* + b* = 0 .
Hence the stream lines are

 lemniscates as above.
   The equipotential circles degenerate into the straight lines
                           x =    0   and     y =      0  .
   If   O be the point in CD produced which is equidistant from A
 and B,     and OC.OD = 0A2 = OB*, the circle with 0 as centre
passing through      A,B is a line of flow.
   The circle having its centre P in AB produced, and passing
through CD, is obviously orthogonal ; and since PA.PB = PC

     It   is clearly impossible         that the same system should have two
pairs of circular stream lines                   of either of the                    classes    we have
analysed.       Nor    can    two complete pairs of different classes occur,
since otherwise two stream lines would intersect.                                        But three real
and an imaginary circle are                  possible,             if ABCD lie               on a circle,
aud at the same time obey the condition                                    for a pair of circles of
the second class, that       AB produced pass through the pole of

(imaginary) circle.

    Verifications   have been     sought by determining           equipotential
lines experimentally,      and superposing them upon drawings             of the
stream lines.      The experiments were executed by students in the
 Physical Laboratory. The process employed was essentially that of
 Kirchhoff, but the use of Thomson's galvanometers has made it
 much more rapid, as well as more delicate.

 the same sign within the hemisphere, one being the subsidiary
 source of the removed sink.            But in order that the distribution
 may remain unchanged, we must have the potential                     maintained
 constant at the edge of the hemisphere.              This may    be effected  by

 4. On    the  Kombi Arrow-Poison (Strophanthus hispidus, DC.)
     of the Manganja district of Africa.             By Dr Thomas R.
    Fraser.
                                 (Abstract.)
    In nearly every narrative of exploration in uncivilised tropical
regions,   accounts are given, often no doubt somewhat fanciful,         of
poisonous    substances which are said to possess the most remark
able properties.      Usually these poisons are of vegetable origin ; and
 the great majority may be included in the two divisions of ordeal
 and of arrow poisons, according as they are applied to one or other
of these     purposes.     Among the most remarkable of the ordeal-
poisons are the     Tanghinia veni/era of Madagascar, the Physostigma
 vtnenosum of Old Calabar, and the Akazga poison of the Gaboon ;
 and of the arrow-poisons, the famous Curara or Wourali of South
 America, and the Antiaris toxicaria of Java.
    The examination       of these  substances has not only proved of
great value to physiology, but practical medicine has likewise been
benefited —one of them, at least, being now an important medicinal
agent.
   In bringing      before the Society a few of the results of a recent
examination      of  a new arrow-poison, the author has to express his
gratitude to the President, who very kindly gave him the specimens
of poison with which the experiments have been made.                 These
specimens, consisting of a number of ripe follicles, were sent to Dr
Christison by    Mr Walker, and      were  collected in the expedition of
the late Bishop M'Kenzie.
   Several specimens of the poison have likewise been sent to Pro
fessor    Sharpey by Dr Kirk, H.M. consul at Zanzibar.            Dr Kirk
       " that the plant is a woody climber, growing in the forest, both
says
of the valley and hills, and found at various places between the
coast and the centre of the continent, above the Victoria Falls of
the Zambesi.        The  stem is several inches in diameter, and rough
outside.     The plant climbs up the highest        trees, and hangs from

100                     Proceedings of the Royal Society
one to the other         like   a bush vine.              The flowers         are   of   a pale yellow,
and last for but a short time during                           the months preceding the first
rains of the season (October and November).   The fruit is ripe in
June, and collected by the natives, who separate the rough outer
coat before drying          it,   preserving the more leathery inner covering
and the seeds."*
   Dr Livingstone gives some interesting information regarding the
poison in his " Narrative of an Expedition to the Zambesi and its
Tributaries."        He mentions that arrows poisoned with                                 it    are used
for killing wild animals only arrows destined for the more noble
                                              ;
object of killing men being poisoned with the entrails of small                                  a
caterpillar.       Dr Livingstone                              follow
                                              says that in hunting, the natives
                                                 "
the game with great perseverance and cunning — The arrow, mak             :
ing no noise, the herd   followed until the poison takes effect, and
                                      is
the wounded animal falls out                 ;     it     is   then patiently        watched         till   it
drops ;    a   portion of meat round the wound                       is   cut away, and all the
rest eaten" (p. 465).
  Dr Livingstone also says that the poisoned arrows are made in
two pieces. " An iron barb   firmly fastened to one end of small
                                             is                                                  a
wand of wood, ten inches or    foot long, the other end of which,
                                                 is a
fined down to        a    long point,                   nicely fitted, though not otherwise
secured,       in the hollow of the reed which forms the arrow-shaft.
The   wood       immediately           below the iron head                is    smeared         with the
poison.        When the arrow               is   shot into an animal, the reed either
falls to the ground at          once, or     is     very soon brushed off by the bushes                     ;
but the iron barb and poisoned upper part of the wood remain                                                in
the wound.         If    made         in one piece, the arrow would often be torn
out, head and all, by the long shaft catching in the underwood, and

  The follicles         examined by the author vary in length from about
nine and three-fourths, to about twelve and one-fourth inches, and
in greatest thickness from about one inch to three-fourths of an inch,
and they vary       in   weight        from about 130 to 330 grains.           They con

                        of Edinburgh,       Session 1869-70.                        101
dated 10th Dec. 1869,         —"   I  reopen your note to say that        I  have   just
dissected a flower, and conclude to name the Kombi plant Slrophan-
thus    hispid us, DC."        This plant belongs      to the natural order Apo-
cynacece.
    When the        seeds    contained     in   these  follicles    are bruised and
treated in a percolator with rectified spirit, a greenish yellow tinc
ture is obtained.         By distilling off   the greater part of the spirit, and
drying the residue         on a water bath, and in the exhausted receiver of
an   air-pump,     an extract is procured which weighs about 25 percent,
of the seeds employed, has an intensely bitter                   taste, and contains
about one half of its weight of an inert fixed oil.               From this extract
the     author     has   succeeded     in separating      a very     powerful     active
 principle.
     As, however,       the  greater number of the experiments have been
 made with the extract, the results of these experiments only will                    be
 described in the following          brief account of the physiological           action
 of the Kombi arrow-poison, it being understood that                 the action of the
 active principle is of the same character.
     When     a  small dose (t^th of a grain) of this extract is mixed with
 a few minims of water, and injected under the skin of a frog, no
 distinct symptom is            seen   until about half        an   hour, when the
 animal's movements            become somewhat sluggish.             Soon afterwards
 the respirations cease, some stiffness occurs in the thoracic extremi
  ties,  reflex sensibility      diminishes,     some    stiffness appears       in the
  pelvic extremities, and in about two hours after the administration,
  voluntary movements entirely            cease, and strong galvanic         irritation
  produces      no  effect,   even   when     applied to exposed         muscles     and
  nerves.     An examination         of the heart shows that it is completely
  paralysed,     the    ventricles   being pale      and    contracted, while        the
  auricles are dark and distended.
      It was obviously       suggested    by these phenomena that this sub
 stance acts as     a  cardiac poison; and, accordingly, some experiments
  were made in which the heart was exposed before the administration,
 of which the following is an example : —
     One-tenth of a grain of extract was injected under the skin of a
 frog.     Five minutes thereafter, it was observed that the ventricular
 systole was somewhat prolonged;               in six minutes, the ventricular
 diastole was imperfect, so that only portions of the ventricle diluted

 to admit     blood   from   the   auricles ; in six minutes         and   thirty
 seconds,   the greater portion of the ventricle was continuously pale

 like projection,     which   at times disappeared,       and   at other times
 only changed its position during the imperfect systole of the ven
 tricle; in   seven   minutes, the ventricle altogether ceased to con
 tract, while    the movements of the auricles continued               at nearly
the normal       rate; and in eighteen       minutes, the auricles       in their
turn became motionless, but, in place of being contracted and empty
 like the ventricle, they       were  distended and full of dark blood.
 Notwithstanding this absolute paralysis of the heart, respiratory
 movements occurred for thirty-five        minutes after the ventricle had
ceased    to contract, and the frog jumped about actively              for some
time after this.
    The experiments that have        been performed with birds and mam
mals have likewise shown that this poison acts primarily on the
heart.
    An endeavour      was made     to ascertain by what        mode    of action
these very peculiar      cardiac effects are produced.       With this object
experiments were made, in which the cerebro-spinal axis was com
pletely destroyed, in which the vagi nerves            were divided,      and in
which the peripheral        terminations    of the vagi were paralysed by
atropia, previously to the exhibition of the Kombi poison ; but no
important modifications were thereby caused, and it is therefore
obvious that the action on the heart is not exerted through                   the
cerebro-spinal nerves.       In other experiments, after complete cardiac
paralysis,    the surface of the heart was irritated          by galvanic    and
other stimulants, but no effect was thereby caused.
    Another very prominent action of this poison is that exerted on
the voluntary muscles, by which their activity is gradually impaired,
and finally completely destroyed,       so that the muscles are       quickly in
a  condition of true rigor mortis.
    Regarding     the other physiological     effects, it  is sufficient briefly
to mention that the sensory and motor spinal nerves, the abdominal
and cervical sympathetics, and the muscular walls of the stomach,
intestines, bladder, and uterus, are paralysed at an early stage,
although     not until the blood-heart has ceased to contract;             while

the lymph-hearts                of the frog maintain         a normal rate long after
paralysis of the blood-heart.*
   From these results it is apparent, that the primary action of the
Kombi arrow-poison is isolated in the heart, and that it may there
fore be included in the class of the cardiac poisons, — a class of
poisons whose action                has   been   most    accurately         defined by the
researches          of Kolliker, Vulpian, Pelikan, Hammond and Weir
Mitchell,          Hilton Fagge and Stevenson, Holme, Dibkowsky, and
others.
       5.   On Thebo-lactic Acid.                By     J.   Y. Buchanan, M.A.
  Thebo-lactic acid was discovered in Turkey opium by Messrs T.
& H. Smith, the eminent morphia manufacturers of this city.  It
was  examined by Stenhouse, and found to have the same composition
as lactic acid, from which, however, it was supposed by the Messrs
Smith to differ in the crystalline form of its copper and morphia
salts.      At present we         are acquainted with three isomeric lactic acids,
two    of them differing from             each other chemically,           whilst      the third
is distinguished           by its power of rotating           the plane of polarisation
of   light.        The last   named acid, having been but recentlyf                 discovered,
it is impossible to say whether it possesses any decidedly distinctive
chemical properties or not.                 The other        two, namely, the ordinary
or    eth yliden — and the ethylen-lactic          acids, possess perfectly distinct
chemical           properties, determined by the different relative position
in each       of   the alcoholic hydroxyl.        The following rational               formulae
express the different constitution of the two acids                    :   —
                    OH,                                           CHaOH
                    CHOH                                          CH,
                    COOH                                          COOH
              Ordinary lactic acid.                          Ethylcu-lactic    acid.
     They may be distinguished               at once     by replacing          in each         the
alcoholic       hydroxyl by chlorine.            We thus obtain from ordinary
 lactic acid the so-called a-, from ethylen-lactic                  acid, the        /3-   chloro-

in the above abstract harmonise in the most satisfactory manner with those
obtained by Professor Sharpey.

propionic acid.     These two bodies possess such different properties,
that they may be at once and with certainty recognised.
   The task, therefore, which       I set myself, was, by the assistance of
the chlorinated      acid, to determine the position in the molecule
of the alcoholic hydroxyl.        Thebo-lactate of lime, dried at 150°, was
treated with perchloride        of phosphorus in the proportion of two
molecules of the latter to one of the former.              This mixture was
heated in a retort, attached to the lower end of a        Liebig's condenser,
until the disengagement of hydrochloric              acid ceased,    when the
condenser was reversed and the volatile products distilled            off.    By
this means the decomposition is so complete that the residue, con
sisting of chloride of calcium, may be heated until the glass of the
retort softens without        carbonising   to  any very sensible       extent.
The distillate  was separated by rectification up to 111° into a residue,
which did not distil without partial decomposition, and a distillate.
The latter   was treated    with the necessary precautions* with water,
to obtain the chlorinated acid, and the former with absolute alcohol,
to obtain its ether.
   The acid thus obtained       possessed all the properties of that formed
from ordinary     lactic acid.      A chlorine determination       gave    32-95
per cent. chlorine.     The theoretical amount calculated from the for
mula C2H5C1Oa is 32-72.          Its specific gravity is 127, against 1-28
found for the acid derived from ordinary lactic acid. It passed
entirely between 185° and 186°        ; the boiling point of a- chloropro-
pionic acid is 186°.        The two acids     have  also  the same outward
appearance,    being colourless, uncrystallisable liquids, possessing the
same    smell, and exercising the same corrosive action on the skin,
unaccompanied by pain or blisters.
   The ether also    possesses exactly the same properties as that pre
pared   from ordinary      lactic acid.   A chlorine determination          gave
26-34 instead   of 26'01 per cent. demanded by the formula C5H9C1Oa.
They both boil at 144°, and have the same smell               ; they are also
both formed with great ease by heating their acids with alcohol and
sulphuric acid.
   It is thus evident that the chlorinated       acids obtained by the same
means    from the two acids under comparison            are  identical.     The
chlorine, therefore, in both cases, is united to the same carbon atom,

and consequently the acids,          in which this chlorine      is replaced by
hydroxyl, have this last named group attached to the same carbon
atom, and are therefore identical.
    It  is proper    to   mention     that all the above       experiments     on
thebo-lactic acid were repeated with ordinary lactic acid, and with
uniformly identical results.
    The copper salts of thebo-lactic         and   of ordinary lactic acids  were
prepared     side by side, as nearly as possible under the same con
ditions,    and in similar    vessels, and     on comparing     the two salts, it
was impossible to detect the slightest difference in their crystalline
form.      The  free acid in concentrated solution produced          no effect on
the plane of polarisation of light.
    I  am engaged at present on the further             comparison of the acids,
and hope to have the honour of communicating                  my results to the
Society on a future occasion.
    In concluding,       I take this opportunity of expressing my best
thanks to the Messrs Smith, who in the most liberal manner placed
at my disposal a large quantity of perfectly pure thebo-lactate of lime.
 6.   On the Bones of a Seal found in Red Clay near Grange
     mouth, with        Remarks        on    the Species.        By Professor
     Turner.
    Towards the end of last autumn, one of my pupils, Mr William
Stirling, B.Sc.,    requested    me to determine         some bones which     had
been found whilst       sinking  a new shaft for a pit in the Grangemouth
coal-field.      On examination,        I  found these bones to be the two
 halves of the lower jaw,     a fragment of the upper jaw with some loose
teeth, the right temporal bone, the atlas with fragments of other
vertebrae,    the glenoid part of the left scapula, the right astragalus
and femur, and small fragments of other bones of the skeleton of                 a
seal.     The animal had not      reached the adult state, for the epiphyses
of the femur were not united to the shaft.                 The  bones  were   im
 bedded in a stiff red clay.
     Early in the present year,          I  was informed by Mr Stirling, the
manager of the Grangemouth collieries, that Mr Burns, of Glasgow,
had obtained     some seal's bones from          the same locality, and had ex
hibited them at a recent meeting of             the Geological Society of Glas

106                 Proceedings     of the Royal Society
gow.     Through the courtesy of Mr Geikie              and  Mr Croll of the
Geological     Survey,    I have had the opportunity of examining              the
bones    obtained by Mr Burns, which          undoubtedly    formed     a  part of
the skeleton of the animal, some of the bones of which              Mr Stirling
had previously given to me, for         I found  amongst them the missing
condyloid epiphysis of the right femur.           These consist of one of the
cervical, and of fragments of other vertebrae, of portions of the ribs,
of the left occipital condyle, of a portion of the innominate bone
and acetabulum, and of digital bones, more especially the terminal
phalanges.
   On a visit to the locality a few weeks ago,              Mr Stirling gave
me the following particulars : —
   In the summer of last year a new shaft            was sunk on      Towncroft
Farm,     Grangemouth,      to reach    the coal   in that district.*      In the

   * In a paper read before the Geological Society of Edinburgh, May 1869,
and published in their Transactions, Mr Jas. Croll has given an account of
the geology of this district; and in a paper read before the Geological Society
of Glasgow, April 2, 1868 (Transactions, iii. p. 183), Mr Jas. Bennie has
recorded the results obtained in the course of " boring" operations in the valley
of the Clyde near Bowling, the haugh of Balmore, the valley of the Kelvin,
and round by the south-eastern end of the Campsie Hills into the valley of
the Forth, near Grangemouth, which reveal that " a great deep hollow
stretched from sea to sea, fairly splitting Scotland in twain."

Whilst removing the blue mud and sand, superficial to the channel
bed, the    lower end of the left humerus of a large red deer was met
with.
    The seal's bones were found near the bottom of the pure red clay,
at a depth     of nearly   80 feet from the present surface of the soil, and
nearly 68 feet below the present sea-level.            The shaft of the pit       is
530 yards distant        from the Carron river to the south, and 1680
yards from the estuary of the Forth on the east.
    That bones of      a species of seal have occasionally been found im
bedded in clay, in the middle district of Scotland, is a fact well
known to naturalists.          But the relations which       these bones had to
the surface, and to the present sea-level, differ in some important
particulars from those of the Grangemouth seal.
    In  1825,   Dr Knox* directed attention to the bones of a seal found
near Camelon, in a bed of clay 90 feet above the present level of the
 Forth. Dr David Page describedf and presented to the Museum
 of Natural History in this city the almost perfect " skeleton of a
 seal, found    in the Pleistocene clays of Stratheden,"          150 feet above
 the present sea-level, about 16 feet from the surface           of the soil, and
 about 5 miles     inland from     the influence   of the tides.J Dr Allman
 on two occasions § exhibited to         this Society bones of a seal — in the
 one instance, obtained from the         Tyrie clay-field, Kirkcaldy,      30 feet
 above the present sea-level,         18 or 19 feet from the surface of the
soil, and a quarter of       a  mile from the shore of the Forth;           in the
other instance, from the clay-field at Portobello, about 20 feet above
 the present high-water level, and about 15 feet below the surface of

    X Since my paper was read to the Royal Society, Dr Page has informed me
that he obtained a second young seal's skeleton from the Stratheden clay,
which is now in the Museum of Natural History, St Andrews. Nearly perfect
skeletons of the surf and eider ducks, Oidema and Somateria, were found in the
same clay.      Dr Page also tells me that he has obtained seal's bones from the
brick clays at Garbridge and Seafield, near St Andrews ; from a brick-field
at Dunbar; and from brick clay at Invernetty, Aberdeenshire.           These clays
 are in the same horizon as the Stratheden clay.      I find also that the skeleton
 of the young seal, in the St Andrew's Museum, has been carefully described
 by Mr R. Walker {Annalt and Magazine of Natural History, Nov. 1863).            He
 shows clearly that it is not Callocephalut vitulimu, and he considers it to be a
young individual of P- groenlandiau.       I have not yet examined this specimen.

of the skeleton of       a seal,    obtained from a brick-field         at  Errol, 45
feet above the present sea-level, and about             1^  mile from the estuary
of the Tay.       The   bones were well imbedded in the brick clay, which
also contained shells such as are now found in the polar seas, and
which testify to the arctic rigour of the climate at the time when
the clay was deposited.
   As to the character of the clay in which the             bones of the Grange
mouth seal were found,         Mr Peach, who       has surveyed the district, and
Mr Geikie,       and    Mr Croll, pronounce it to have been deposited
under decidedly arctic conditions.              Mr Peach also tells me that the
Grangemouth clay is continuous with that at Camelon, near Falkirk,
 where the seal's bones which           Dr Knox examined           were   found, and
that it possesses the same characters as the Stratheden                      clay, in
which lay the skeleton of the seal described by Dr Page.
   Mr David Robertson of Glasgow                has also examined the        Grange
mouth red clay with reference to the occurrence in                     it of minute
organisms.       He reports that         he has found two species           of Foru-
minifera, Polymorphina compressa (D'Orb)and Nonionina asterizans
(F. & M.), and one species of Ostracoda, Cytheropteron montrosiensi.
This Ostracod Mr Robertson             states to be common in the brick clays
of Annochie,       Dryleys, Errol, Elie, and Bannie on the east of Scot
land, which       deposits contain arctic shells not now living on the
British    coasts.
   Mr Bennie       also informs me that        Mr Robertson     has obtained from
the muddy sand and fine sandy clay which overlie the Grangemouth
pure red clay, fragments             of shells, the TeUitia balthica, a shell
which,     Mr Jeffreys      states,   agrees    exactly with similar fragments
found by Professor Lilljeborg            at Upsala.      No fragments of shells
have as yet been found in the red             clay itself.    The geological evi
dence is in favour      of the view that      the Grangemouth        clay is glacial,
and belongs to the same class as other undoubtedly glacial clays on
the east coast of Scotland.            The difference in the relation to the
present sea-level between            the Grangemouth         clay and the other
clays presents no difficulty in placing them in the same category ;
for we have but to suppose that, during the period of submergence,
when     these     clays were formed, the water in the Grangemouth

 locality was some 200 feet deeper than in the districts of Stratheden
or of Errol, so that the change in the relative position of land and
water    which has taken place since that time             has caused the Strath
eden     clays to be elevated 150 feet              above  the present sea-level,
whilst the Grangemouth            clay is some 60 or 70 feet below it.
     I  shall now proceed to inquire into the characters of the bones
of the Grangemouth          seal, with the view of determining        — lsi,Wbether
the animal was of the same species as the seals whose bones have
been      found in beds of clay in Scotland by other naturalists                ;  and,
2d, Whether the species is or is not the common seal, Callocejihalus
vilulinus, which now frequents our coasts.
     With regard to the first part of the inquiry,                 I  have compared
 this Grangemouth seal with the Errol seal found by the Rev. Thomas
 Brown, with the skeleton from Stratheden, and with the bones of
 the Portobello         seal,   which   form a part of the natural            history
  collection in the Museum of Science and Art.                 I  may mention, that
  the bones      from Portobello have received some important additions
  since     Dr Allman drew attention to them at the meeting of this
  Society ; for Dr Andrew Balfour, by whom they were discovered,
  has added       to the collection    one-half of the lower jaw and several
   teeth.
      As regards the Errol seal, the bones recovered wore vertebrae and
  ribs,   of which two only, viz., the atlas         and one of the lower cervical
  vertebras, have representatives in the Grangemouth                  skeleton.      The
   Errol    seal   is an older animal, and the bones are larger and more
  completely ossified than those of the Grangemouth seal                  ; but when
  due allowance        is made for the difference in age, their form and
  general      characters are so much alike that             I   believe them     to be
  animals of the same species.           The materials for comparison with the
  Portobello       and Stratheden seals are, fortunately, more com plete            ; for
  in them, as in the Grangemouth              seal,   the lower jaw and teeth are
  almost perfect, and the femur, scapula, and other bones are repre
  sented in each skeleton.           All three animals      were immature, for the
   epiphyses of the thigh bones are not yet anchylosed to the shafts.
   The atlas of the Portobello            seal  is somewhat less in its antero
    posterior   diameter      than in the one from Grangemouth,               and     the
   distance   of the inferior dental foramen from            the hinder end of the
   lower   jaw  is greater in the Portobello and         the Stratheden than in the
                                                                              p

Grangemouth       specimens.      These differences are,     I believe,  merely
individual    and not specific.     On the other hand, there is so close a
correspondence in the general form of the lower jaws, in the num
ber and cuspidation        of the teeth, and in the mode in which they
arc implanted in their sockets, that            I am of opinion these seals
were animals of the same species.              This identity in the specific
characters of the seals found in the clay formations on the east
coast of Scotland       furnishes   an  additional    argument in favour of
the view, that they have been deposited at the same epoch                     and
under the same         conditions.     We   may    now inquire     if this clay
seal corresponds with the present          British  species, the Gallocephalus
vitulinics.

    Dr Knox     stated    that the Camelon seal was identical           with the
 species now inhabiting the Forth, and many other naturalists who
 have written     on this matter aro inclined         to the same     view.    At
 the time when Dr Knox wrote, the specific differences between the
 various northern seals had not been precisely made out, and the
 determination is even yet one of much difficulty, unless the skulls
 and teeth can be compared with each other.              Dr Knox    does not say
 what the bones were which came under his observation, so that we
 have now no means         of knowing how far        he had in his possession
 the materials for making an exact comparison.

                     of Edinburgh,         Session 1869-70.                       Ill
    Dr Page expresses himself with more reserve regarding the Strath-
 eden seal.     He looks upon it "       as a pretty widely divergent variety
of the common seal,       if not  a distinct species    — a point, however, which
yet awaits the precise determination of the comparative anatomist."
    I  have now carefully compared the jaws (more especially the
lower, which are best preserved), and the teeth of the Grangemouth,
Stratheden,      and Portobello       seals,   not only with       the adult skulls
and teeth of the common seal, but with a young skull of that species,
apparently      about the same age as the fossil specimens, and               I have
no hesitation     in saying that they       are not    of the   same species.    The
number of teeth is indeed the same, but the character and mode of
implantation      of the molars exhibit important differences. In the
clay seals,    the number of cusps in the premolar and molar series
does not exceed four, and this number is              distinctly marked in all but
 the first and last.     The    second cusp in each tooth is the largest, but
 it does not preponderate very greatly over the first and               third  cusps,
 and the bases     of the crowns     are not much swollen.           The teeth    are
 set  in the jaw in longitudinal              series,   one   directly behind the
 other.
    In   the young      of the common        seal the cuspidation      of the lower
 molars is not so uniform as in the clay seals                ;  the last molar has
 four cusps, the penultimate has five, and the third and second only
 three.    One cusp preponderates largely over the others, and the
 base  of the crown is swollen.        The molar      teeth, also, are set obliquely
 in the jaw,     so that one tooth not       only lies in front, but somewhat
 to the outer side of the one behind it. This oblique setting of the
 grinders is also seen in well grown specimens.
    The upper molars in the clay          seals are smaller and more delicately
 formed than in the common               seal.      They    are,  as a rule,  tricus-
 pidate, and with, as      a  rule, the central cusp the largest.          They    are
 not set obliquely,       and the more anterior             do not overlap those
 which lie behind.         In the common          seal, again, the anterior cusp
 is usually the biggest, and the upper,            like the lower molars,     are set
 obliquely.
    I have   also compared the jaws and teeth of these clay seals with
the   skulls of Phoca       barbata,    Halichoerus      gryphus, and Pagophilus
groenlandicus, northern seals, which possess the same general dental
formula.      With barbata and yryphus there are so many points of

112                Proceedings     of the Royal Society
difference that    I cannot regard them as identical.       With    the Green
land seal, again, the points of       resemblance are, in some respects,
very striking.      They   agree  in the number, mode of arrangement,
and relative size of the cusps, and in the mode in which the teeth
are implanted     in  the jaws, though the teeth are set closer together
in the fossil than in the Greenland species.          Unfortunately,     I have
not had access to a young skull of the Pagophilus groenlandicus, or
to an adult clay seal, so that the materials for comparison have
not, in this respect, been as perfect as to enable me to identify the
species   with accuracy. The examination, however, which                 I  have
made, leads me to think that these young clay seals may be either
immature specimens of the Pagophilus groenlandicus, or of a closely-
allied species.     But it will be difficult to express a positive opinion
until adult skulls    are compared with each other, and the skulls         of the
clay seals be compared with the crania of Pagomys fcclidus, crania
of which are not yet in my possession.

    Since this paper was read to the Society,         I  have received some
additional material of considerable importance in connection with
the determination of the species         of seal found   in the glacial clay-
beds   of Scotland.     Dr Howden     has kindly   sent me the bones of an
adult seal, found in glacial marine clay at Puggiston,             three miles
from Montrose.*         Through Mr William Livesay           and  Dr M'Bain,
 I have had the opportunity of examining three crania of the small
arctic seal, Pagomys fcetidus, Gray (Phoca hispida, Cuvier).               These
 skulls were from two adult and one young specimen.f
    The bones from Montrose          included several     vertebrae   and ribs,
pelvis, scapulae, and the long bones of the extremities,               together
 with the two halves of the lower jaw and the left upper jaw.               They
 were found    thirty feet below the surface, about three quarters of a
 mile from the tidal estuary of the South Esk, and about five feet
    * The geology of this district has been carefully described by Dr Howden
 in the Trans. Kd. Geolog. Soc. 1867-68.
    t These skulls were procured in the Spitzbergen seas during the arctic
 expedition conducted last summer by Mr Lamont.

                   of Edinburgh,      Session 1869-70.                        113
above the present sea-level.       I have compared these bones with the
corresponding bones in the skeleton of the common seal, and have
satisfied   myself that they belong to animals of different species.             I
have also compared them with          the bones of the other clay seals
already referred to, and am of opinion that the Montrose seal is an
adult of the same species as the Stratheden, Portobello, and Grange
mouth specimens.        Comparing the lower jaw of the Montrose seal
with that from Grangemouth,         depicted on page 110, we find that
they have the same general form, differing from each other only
slightly in size ; that the teeth have the same characters, and are
implanted in the jaw after the same manner.
   If we compare the lower jaw of the adult Montrose clay seal with
that of an adult Pagophilus groenlandicus, we find important dif
ferences    in size, which are expressed       in the following      table,    the
dimensions being taken in straight lines —

   On the posterior border     of the ascending ramus of the lower jaw
of  P.  groenlandicus, a large triangular       tubercle projects obliquely
backwards and inward; in the clay         seals, both adult and immature,
the corresponding tubercle is not triangular, and has the form of an
elongated almost vertical ridge.        The teeth in the adult clay           seal
are set more closely together than in       P.   groenlandicus, and though
the cusps in the fossil are considerably worn, yet there is not that
preponderance of the central cusp over the anterior and posterior
cusps   in the fossil, as in the Greenland        seal. The comparison of
the temporal bones,      and of the upper jaw with its teeth, of the
adult fossil with the Greenland       seal also showed     important differ
ences, so that 1 am constrained        to give up the idea, at one time
thought probable, that these seals were of the same species.
   I have now instituted a comparison between the lower jaws               of the
adult clay seal and of the Pagomys fectidus, and find they correspond

114                Proceedings      of the Royal Society
much more closely, not only in form, but in dimensions.            The corres
ponding dimensions of the latter to those of the clay seal already
given in the table, being respectively 4 inches, 0-8 inches, 1"2 inches,
and 1'4   inches; the differences, therefore, being       so trifling  as to be
merely     individual.      They both possess the elongated ridge-like
tubercle on the posterior border of the ascending ramus, and a deep
masseteric fossa on its outer surface, which is bounded posteriorly
by a ridge ascending to the outer end of the condyle, which ridge
becomes continuous         with that on the posterior border already re
ferred to; in both the lower border of the horizontal             ramus is in
curved opposite the last molar tooth, behind which incurved portion
it sweeps backwards and outwards in a graceful curve;                   in both
the arrangement and cuspid at ion of the teeth are closely similar,
although the intervals between the anterior molars are somewhat
greater in P./cetidus,       than in the fossil.
   The upper jaws and temporal bones in               the  two seals closely
correspond in form.
   The affinity, therefore, of the fossil seal to Pagomys fectidus is
very close, — so close, indeed, that        I  should not consider myself
justified in pronouncing them to         be distinct species.
   So far, then, as     I have had   access to materials for comparison,       I
am inclined     to think that the    seal, the remains    of which   are found
in the brick-clays     of Scotland, corresponded with the now existing
small arctic seal,     P. fectidus.
   I  am not aware that there is any satisfactory evidence to show
that this northern        seal ever visits our shores at the present day,
so that we may consider the determination          of its bones   in the brick-
clays to be an additional piece of evidence to those advanced from
other data, that at the time when these clays were deposited an
 arctic climate prevailed over Scotland.

   The following Communications               were read     : —
1.   On the Rate of Mortality of Assured Lives as experienced
    by Ten Assurance          Companies in Scotland            from 1815 to
    1863.      By James          Meikle,     Esq.      Communicated           by
    Professor Tait.
    The mortality of    assured lives is introduced by a short statement
of the process followed in the obtainment of the rate of mortality
among the male population           of England and Wales during seven
teen years, and in which the results are compared with the rate
obtained by following the same process with the male population of
Scotland   during ten      years.    A statement     is given   of the method
employed for collecting        the facts referring to assured lives, and of
tabulating the results with the view of extracting, not only the
total numbers entering upon and dying in each year of life, but of
exhibiting the experience of several highly interesting and impor
tant sections of risks, and more especially with the view of show
ing the nature and benefits accruing from the           assurance   of selected
healthy lives.
    The subject generally is divided into the consideration of the
mortality on    healthy lives —males—females — and diseased lives.
                              Assured Male Lives.
    In treating of healthy lives —males — a comparison is          made   of the
actual number of deaths during each quinquennial period of life, with
 the number which might have died according to the Carlisle table
 and the Actuaries'     table of 1837.      The   rates of mortality    at each
 age, summed      in periods of five     years, are also compared.       These
 comparisons point out that the Carlisle table exhibits a greater rate
of mortality up to age fifty, and a lesser rate at higher ages than the
experience    of the  offices  ; and that the Actuaries' table, at nearly
all ages, is slightly greater than that of the Offices.           A short  com

116                         Proceedings      of the Royal Society
parison is made of the rates of mortality of male lives according to
the three English life tables and that derived from the population
of Scotland, already referred to, with the mortality of the selected
healthy assured              males of the ten Scottish offices.                       A   very general
view of the benefits of selection is thus obtained.                         The assurances
on healthy male lives are divided into two classes                       — assurances with
profits, and assurances              without profits       ;    the mortality of the " with
            "
profit          class   exhibiting results in       a   highly favourable direction, and
of the "         without 'profit" class      in an unfavourable direction                    — the   one
being 10 per cent, and  7 per cent, less than the Carlisle and Actuaries'
tables respectively, and the other about 12 and 13 per cent, greater.
   The foregoing comparisons of the actual and computed number
of deaths at each year of life are reclassified in another form, so as
to exhibit the actual and computed deaths out                          of the entrants at each
age, and          thus show how far      one aggregate          table of mortality expresses
or represents            the experience of its several parts or sections.                         These
comparisons are made with the Carlisle and Actuaries' tables, from
which it will be seen that neither table accurately measures                                          the
experience of sections of entrants.                     Young entrants exhibit a greater
mortality than estimated by either table.                              There      is,     at same time,
exhibited          a    similar comparison of       the experience               of   the ten offices,
derived from the aggregate male lives, reapplied to the                                           several
sections of entrants, which points out in                      a    still more marked manner
the inappropriateness of               one   aggregate table of mortality to measure
the experience of its sections.                  There         is   also exhibited the            extent
of the deviations, favourable as well as unfavourable, in each yeai
of    the       assurances,    from which      it   will       be seen     that the deviations
are    highly favourable during              the first four years, and that after the
fourth year they are almost always unfavourable.
                                     Assured Female Lives.
     In considering            the mortality of females, there             is,   in the first place,
given       a    comparison of the difference between the mortality of males
and of females of the population, and of the Actuaries' table of 1837,
pointing out that             a   nearly similar relation exists between the results
of these           tables     with that experienced between                      male       and   female
assured          lives in the Scottish offices,                viz.,
                                                                greater mortality of
                                                                       a
female life up to age forty-five.                   On the other hand, the male and

                          of     Edinburgh, Session 1869-70.                                          117
female Government annuitants                     of 1829 and of 1860 exhibit                  a greater
mortality of male life               at   all    ages.     An explanation of these dif
ferences        is offered.       A comparison is then                made between the actual
number of deaths and rate of mortality, of healthy assured females,
with the computations                    according to the Carlisle                  and Actuaries'
tables.       There      is,   at same time, given        a    table, showing the favourable
and unfavourable deviations of the                       one    aggregate table of mortality,
as   a   measure of the experience of sections of entrants.                              From this
table    it   will    be seen that neither the Carlisle nor the Actuaries' table
correctly measures the mortality of female assurants under age thirty                                       -
five; and        it   will     be inferred from the results given, that the table,
based upon the aggregate experience                       of    assured female lives, cannot
measure         the aggregate experience and at same time accurately re
present       the mortality of its sectional parts.

of deaths and of the rates of mortality, according to the Carlisle and
Actuaries' tables, there  given view of the rates of mortality expe
                                    is           a
rienced on assurances               effected with participation              in profits and with
out participation,             and an explanation              is   given of the reason            of the
greater mortality of assurances without profits, by pointing out that
a    very much greater mortality                  has been experienced on assurances
(without profits) effected for temporary periods, averaging about 40
per cent, on lives under age 50.   The relation of the aggregate to
the sectional experience, as in the case of male and female lives
separately,       is   shown with similar results.                   A    very full comparison         is
thereafter effected              between the mortality               of   assured    lives with the
mortality of the population.                    After comparing            these aggregate expe
riences,      a   comparison        is   made    between        the rate of mortality expe
rienced on assured lives, excluding the light mortality of the first
year, first two years, &c., of the assurances, and the general aggre
gate rate of mortality of the population, with the view of pointing out.
in this form, the relation of the mortality of assured lives, after the
effectsof selection have subsided, to the mortality of the population.
The effect of selection is thereafter considered in its proper manner,
and comparisons                made between the mortality of                        persons        in the
same quinquennial                period     of life,     but arranged          according to the

years while selection is in operation is balanced by a heavier mor
tality thereafter,         and    showing further that that heavier mortality
is considerably          greater than the general average                     mortality    of    a
single aggregate mortality table.                    These are exemplified in various
forms.       The comparisons,            however,       are    all   based   upon lives    once
assured.         There    is,   finally, given in one view the rate of mortality
experienced on all entrants of each age, during each year of assur
ance, as the true exponent of the rate                      of mortality     on assured   lives,

by about 20 per cent.              The       diseased       lives were thereafter broken
up into sections,         according to the nature of the imperfections                       for
which the extra charge was made, and showing the rate of mortality

annual premium for assurance of L.100 at death, showing the extra

  The second principle is based upon a formula, which expresses the

  several differences are given in both cases, and the results applied

    2.  Notes on Indian Society and            Life in the Age when the
        Hymns of the Rigveda were composed. By John Muir,
        D.C.L., LL.D., Ph.D.
                                    (Abstract.)
       The paper began by stating, that although the hymns of the
  Rigveda exhibit a simpler and less developed stage of religious be
  lief and conception than     we find   in the works of the earliest Greek
  poets, and a system       of ideas   wildly   diverse,  both from the my
  thological    forms and the theosophic opinions, of the later Indian
  pantheon, and of subsequent speculation         ; and although many of the
  customs and practices of that early age are different from those of
  later times, we are not to suppose         that in the former period the
  condition    of society  was of a very primitive       description.   On the
  contrary, there are many signs of a considerable progress in civilisa
   tion and culture then existing.          The opinion of the late Pro
   fessor  H. H. Wilson    on this head was then quoted      ; and as one proof
  in support of the position, the variety and occasional elaborateness       of
 the metres in which the hymns are composed was referred to.
     1.  Some account was then given of the country occupied by the
                                 — of which a considerable portion is con
Indians of the Vedic era

 120               Proceedings of    the  Royal Society
sidered   to have been cultivated, though        much was also covered by
forests — and of their villages   and cities, or fortified places, and     their
houses.
   2. A sketch    was then given of the manner in which            a priest  of
the Vedic age may be supposed         to have spent the greater part of
the night watching for, and hailing, with hymns and offerings, the
appearance     of the several deities, the Asvins — Ushas (the Dawn),
Agni (Fire). Surya (the Sun), &c.,         at the times when they were
supposed    respectively to manifest themselves.
   3. The discrepant opinions of two Sanscrit scholars, Professor Max
Miiller and Dr Bollensen, on the question whether or not the
Indians made images of their gods during the Vedic age, are adduced,
but it was considered that the question is not ripe for decision.
   4. It  was next stated that   this tract of country was divided into
numerous principalities,     governed by their respective kings, who
appear to have lived in considerable state, and to have been possessed
of  a good deal of     wealth, both in cattle and goods          of different
descriptions.
   5. Reference was made to the existence         of both rich and poor in
the communities, and some verses,      in praise of liberality to the latter,
translated from the original, were read.
   6. Some particulars    relating to domestic relations, and life and
manners, were then given.        Polygamy     appears   to have existed, but
not of course as the rule.   It was considered a misfortune for a woman
to grow old unmarried.       Women appear, sometimes at least, to have
been allowed to choose their own husbands.            According to    a hymn
of the Atharva-veda,     the remarriage of widows seems to have been
permitted    ; and from averse of the Rigveda, it appears probable that
a widow could marry the brother of her deceased husband, when the
latter had died childless.       Allusions     to  conjugal   infidelity and
sexual immorality     occur.
   7. It  was stated that considerable attention seems         to have been
paid to personal decoration, as reference is made, in various places,
to elegance of dress, and to the use of jewels.        No mention     is made
of cotton as a material for clothing      ;  though, as the plant      is con
sidered to be indigenous in India, and the use of light cotton cloth
seems    essential to comfort    in so warm a climate,        it is probable
that it was well known.         Wool    is mentioned      in various    places.

 The hair appears to have been occasionally worn wound or braided
 upwards          in       a   spiral form.
     8. Barley, at least,                  if   not wheat also, and no doubt other grains,
 were used as food.                   The       flesh of kine also seems to have been eaten.
 Wine (from what material distilled does not appear) was drunk by
 people of the upper classes, contrary to the usage of the later
 Hindus.
     9.      A hymn, descriptive of the variety of men's                          tastes and pursuits,
 was given             in       a metrical        translation, in which various professions
 are mentioned, viz., those of poet, priest, physician, carpenter                                :   the
 construction of chariots is often alluded to; and working in iron or
 other metals, and in hides, must have been common, as the mention
 of weapons of war and other metal implements, and of leather, is
 constantly occurring.                          Weaving, too, was of course practised, and
 boat      building understood,                   as boats are frequently referred to.               The
 caste system does not seem to have been developed during the earlier
 part of the Vedic era                 ;    but in a few of the later hymns Brahmans are
 mentioned             ;       and in one text the names of the four castes Brahman,
 Rajanya, Vaisya, and Sudra, occur in conjunction.                                  A free translation
 was given             of      a hymn in which the Brahmans and their observances
 appear to be satirised.                        From what       precedes under head 8,         it will
 be seen that agriculture                        was practised, and specific references to            it,
 and apparently to irrigation                        as   auxiliary   to   it,   occur.
        Playing at dice was a favourite amusement of the Vedic
      10.
 Indians, as appears from numerous texts.        hymn, in which the        A
 miseries of gambler's life are strikingly described, was given in an
                       a
 English metrical                  dress.        Gaily    dressed dancers or actors are referred
 to as   exhibiting their performances.
       11.Theft and robbery are alluded to as common offences.
      12. As animals, wild or tame, mentioned in the Rigveda, kine,
 horses,          sheep, goats, dogs,              deer, boars, buffaloes, apes, wolves, and
 lions, are adduced.   Elephants, too, are alluded to in the Rigveda,
 certainly as wild, but whether or not as tame also      not so clear.                is
 Among birds, pigeons, falcons, vultures, ducks, swans, and quails
are referred               to.

              need scarcely be said that wars were frequent in the Vedic

 them was also given in verse. War chariots were in use, and banners,
 defensive armour, and various kinds of offensive weapons, bows and
 arrows,    spears, &c., are referred to.
    14.   Finally, allusion   was again made to the number and elaborate
 ness of the metres      in the Rigveda; and as regards the occasional
 beauty and variety of the illustrative        imagery, the moral depth of
 many of the sentiments, and the power of observation exhibited in its
 contents, reference is made to the hymns to the Dawn, and to seve
 ral of those adduced in the course of the paper.             In  a few hymns
 we find the beginning         of speculation   on the origin of    all things.
 One of these was communicated, rendered into English verse.

                      1. Livingstone's Recent Discoveries.
    In   1866 the indefatigable    Dr Livingstone is again in Africa, with
the determination of filling up the great gaps in our knowledge of
the lake region from Nyassa to Tanganyika,              beginning    the great
journey from which he has not yet returned.
    News arrived in England, in September 1866, that the traveller
had, for a     third time, entered the Rovuma river,      and had succeeded
in penetrating for 130 miles from its mouth, where he had found               a
friendly chief, whose residence he intended to make the starting-
point of his expedition to the northern end of Nyassa, and the
south of Tanganyika.           A long period of silence then intervened,
during which we were ignorant of the whereabouts of the traveller,
till  a report was brought to the east coast by some lying Johanna

                    of Edinburgh,        Session.1869-70.                       123
men    who had deserted him, that Livingstone              had been murdered
near the south end        of the lake.       This report, however,        was dis
credited by the head      of  the  Royal Geographical Society,          and a boat
expedition sent out by the Society, under the leadership of                      Mr
Young, confirmed the opinion of its untruth.
   From his more recent letters, we learn that Livingstone                   passed
round the southern end of Lake Nyassa, where he seems                      to have
struck into nearly the old route of Lacerda and Monteiro, along
the water parting between the tributaries of the Zambezi and the
Nyassa.
   Passing   at a distance of about twenty miles to westward               of Chin-
yanga, the furthest point which he had reached in his excursion of
1863 from Nyassa, he got into the valley          of the Loangwa or Arangoa.
The greater part of Livingstone's           subsequent    route is contained in
his letter of date   July  1868.      In this  he says  — " Leaving the valley
of the Loangwa, which enters the Zambezi at Zumbo, we climbed
up what seemed to be a great mountain mass, but                   it turned out   to
be   only the southern edge of an elevated region, which is from
3000 to 6000       feet above     the sea.     This upland may be roughly
stated   to cover a space south of Tanganyika               of some 350 miles
square.    It  slopes   to north and west, but        I  have    found no part of
it under 3000 feet of altitude.            The country of Usango, situated
east  of the  space indicated, is also an upland.           .  .  .  Usango forms
the eastern side     of a great but    still elevated valley. The other, or
western side, is formed by what are called the Kone Mountains,
beyond the copper mountains of Katanga."
                                  "
    Livingstone continues — The southern end of the great valley,
enclosed between Usango and the Kone Mountains, is between 11°
and 12° south.       In   11° 6' south, ascending from the valley             of the
 Arangoa,    we were fairly on the upland."               This     was perhaps in
 January   1867, or about the middle           of the rainy season       here.   He
 writes — "As     we    advanced,     brooks, evidently       perennial,    became
 numerous.      Some of     these brooks went eastward,            to fall into the
 Loangwa;     others went north-west, to join the Chambeze."                    The
 Chambeze,    with all its     branches,    flows from the eastern side into
                                                  "
the centre   of the great upland valley,            which," says Livingstone,
•'is probably the valley         of  the  Nile.     It  is an interesting river,
helping to form three lakes, and changing its name three times in

 124                 Proceedings     of the Royal Society
 the 500 or 600 miles of its course.          I crossed   the Chambeze in 10°
 34' south, and several      of its confluents, north and south, quite as
large as the Isis at      Oxford, but running faster, and having hippo
potami     in them."
    Livingstone reached       a place called Bemba, on the plateau,             in
 February 1867, and fixed its position in 10° 10' south, 31° 50' east.
 Proceeding northwards, in         April 1867, he discovered      Lake Liemba.
 It  lies in a hollow, with precipitous sides          2000  feet down, on the
 northern slope of the upland.           " It  is extremely beautiful,     sides,
 top, and bottom being covered           with    trees  and other vegetation.
Elephants, buffaloes, and antelopes feed on its steep slopes             ; whilst
 hippopotami,      crocodiles, and fish swarm         in the waters.    It  is as
perfect a natural paradise as Xenophon could have desired.                    On
 two rocky islands men         till the land, rear goats, and catch fish.
 The villages ashore are embowered in the oil palms of the west of
 Africa."
    " Four considerable streams flow into Liemba, and a number of
brooks, from 12 to 15 feet broad, leap down the steep bright                  red
clay, such are the rocks, and form splendid cascades, that made the
dullest of my attendants pause and remark with wonder."
    Livingstone     does not give any note of the direction        of these four
rivers, which flow into the lake         ;  but it appears     a necessary   con
clusion,    from its position,      that these should       have their rise on
the higher side of the plateau, and flow to the lake from the
east.
    " The lake is from     18 to 20 miles broad, and from 35 to 40 miles
long.     It  goes off to north-north-west,       in a river-like prolongation,
                    —
two miles wide it is said to Tanganyika." Livingstone continues
       I
— " would have set it down as an arm of Tanganyika, but that
its surface is 2800 feet above the level of the sea, while Speke
makes the lake Tanganyika 1844 feet only."                  The observation of
Livingstone      here confirms the opinion       of Mr Findlay, given in an
able paper read before the Geographical             Society in 1867, in which,
by a recomputation      of the thermometer heights        measured by Captain
Speke,    he came to the conclusion that        Tanganyika Lake       was at an
elevation of 2800       feet  above   the sea;      and that, since its fresh
waters    must have an outlet, this would most probably be found to
be to northward.

   Livingstone continues—"        I tried   to follow this river-like portion
of Liemba, but       was prevented     by a war which had broken out
between     the chief of Itawa and a party of ivory traders from
Zanzibar.     I then set off to go 150 miles south, then west till past the
disturbed district, and to explore the west of Tanganyika,                but, on
going 80 miles,     I found an Arab party, showed them            a  letter from
the Sultan of Zanzibar, which           I   owe    to the kind offices of his
Excellency Sir Bartle Frere, late governor of Bombay, and                  was at
once supplied with provisions, cloth, and beads. . . . After                 peace
was made,     I visited Nisama, the chief of Itawa, and having left the
Arabs, went on to Lake Moero, which                I  reached on the 8th Sep
tember 1867.       In  the northern    part Moero is from 20 to 33 miles
broad.     Further south it is at least 60 miles wide, and it is 50
miles long.      Ranges of tree-covered mountains flank it on both
sides, but at the broad part the western mountains dwindle                  out of
sight."
   Lake Moero is the central         one    of the three     on the Chambeze
river.    The river runs into Lake Bangweolo, at the head of the
valley, and on coming out of it assumes the name of Luapula.
The Luapula flows down north, past the town of the Cazembe, and
12 miles below it enters Lake Moero.              Passing up the eastern side
of Moero, Livingstone came to the Cazembe's town.                  It  stands on
the north-east      bank of the lakelet Mofwe.            This is from     1  to 3
miles broad, and nearly 4 long.          It    has several low reedy islands,
and yields plenty of fish, a species          of perch.    It is not connected
with the Luapula or Moero.
   "  I was forty days at Cazembe's," says Livingstone,            "  and might
then have gone on to Lake Bangweolo, which is larger than either
of the other lakes, but the rains had              set  in, and this lake      was
reported to be very unhealthy.         I then     went north for   Ujiji, where
I have goods, and     I  hope for letters   ;  for  I have heard nothing from
the world for more than two years         ;   but  when I got within thirteen
days of Tanganyika,       I was brought     to a standstill by the abundance
of water in front.      A  native party came through and described the
country as inundated, so as to be waist deep, with sleeping places
difficult to find.      This flood lasts till May or June.             At last   I
became so tired     of inactivity that    I    doubled   back on my course to
 Cazembe."

  126               Proceedings       of the Royal Society
    In   this attempt to reach      Ujiji, Livingstone     appears to have    in
 tended to reach the west side of the Tanganyika by the road which
 Captain     Speke reported from          Warruwa     (evidently   the   Rua of
 Livingstone) to the ferry by which he had crossed from Ujiji ; and
 it was apparently during this attempt that Livingstone obtained,
 by actual observation, the report which he gives of the lower course
 of the Luapula.      He says — " On leaving Moero at its northern end,
 by a rent in the mountains of Rua, the river takes the name of Lua-
 laba, and passing on north-north- west forms Ulenge             in the country
 west   of Tanganyika.      I   have only seen it where it leaves Moero,
 and  where it comes out of the crack in the mountains of Rua."
    The flat inundated country beyond this point seems to have been
his turning-point. He says — " To give an idea of the inundation
which, in a small way, enacts the part of the Nile lower down,                  I
had to cross two rivulets, which flow into the north end of Moero—
one,   the Luo, had covered a plain abreast            of Moero,    so that the
water on a great part reached from the knees to the upper part of
the chest.       The plain was of black mud, with grass higher than
our heads.       We had to follow the path which the feet of passengers
had worn into deep ruts.         Into   these places we every now and then
plunged, and fell over the ankles into soft mud, while hundreds
of bubbles rushed up, and bursting emitted a frightful odour."
    Having returned to Cazembe's in about February or March of
1868, Livingstone seems to have gone south at the beginning of
the dry season, to Lake Bangweolo, from which his letter is dated
in  July    1868.
    The next news     we have    of the great traveller is in a letter from
Ujiji,  on   Lake Tanganyika, dated May 1869. He appears to have
reached     this point by the eastern side of Tanganyika,            not by the
western as before attempted       ; since he writes in the above letter,   " As
to the work to be done by me,            it is only to connect the      sources
which     I  discovered from 500 to 700           miles south of Speke and
Baker's, with their Nile.        The volume of water which flows north
from latitude 12° S., is so large, that       I suspect I have    been working
at the sources     of the Congo      as well as those    of the Nile.    I have
to go down the eastern        line of drainage to Baker's turning-point.
Tanganyika and Nyige Chowambe (Baker's ?) are one water, and the
head of it is 300 miles south of this.             The western and central

                   of Edinburgh, Session 1869-70.                             127
lines of drainage converge into an unvisited lake west or south-west
of this.    The outflow of this lake, whether to Nile or Congo, I
have    to ascertain."   From the above it would appear that Living
stone had made an excursion          northward from       Ujiji,  either by land
or on the lake, to ascertain the union of the Tanganyika with the
Albert Nyanza.
    News has since been received, which shows that Livingstone was
still at Ujiji in July  1869.     In January of this year,       a report arrived
 from the west coast of the continent,            describing    the fearful end
 which the traveller had come to, of his being quartered and burnt                ;
 but this report turns out to be an old story of date          June   1868, with
 its plot laid on the Zambezi, and at this time we know that Living
 stone was safe on the Chambeze lakes.
                        2. The Sources      of the Nile.
     The main point of interest in the latest travels of Livingstone,
 and that which gives to them a distinctive importance over the
 great accomplishments        of his former journeys, is that in            these
 Livingstone has undoubtedly visited and beheld the long sought-
 for sources of the Nile. It is true that there is considerable doubt
 as to which    of the basins that     he has   explored will ultimately        be
 acknowledged as the cradle       of the Nile   ;  but this at least is certain,
 that the real head streams        have been visited by Livingstone, and
 the long-vexed question has, by these last explorations, resolved
 itself into  a choice between    two or perhaps three main streams.
     Livingstone himself     has   apparently no bias in favour of one or
 other, so that the discussion is a perfectly open one.               The three
 rival head    streams  are — first, the feeders     of Lake Liemba; and,
 second,   the Chambeze and its lake chain, both of which rise near
 the eastern edge of the great longitudinal plateau of the side of
 Africa next the Indian        Ocean   ;  the third is the source        recently
 claimed for the Nile by Dr Beke, in his " Solution of the Nile
  Problem,"* the Great Casai or Kassabi river, which rises nearer
  the Atlantic side, in 12° S.      Of the first of these, the feeders of
 Lake Liemba, we may say, with             almost absolute certainty,         that
 they are   tributaries  to the  Nile, and it is    most   probable that they
are  the sources   of that river.    Livingstone has found these rivers
                          * Athenseum,   Feliruary  1870.

128                      Proceedings of the Royal Society
flowing into Lake Liemba; a river-like prolongation unites Liemba
and Tanganyika,               these two appearing to be at the same level          ;    then
Tanganyika         and        Nyige Chowambe, which is evidently the Albert
Nyanza, are one water, and that the last is a reservoir of the "White
Nile is undoubted.
  The union of the second presumptive head stream, the Cham-
beze, with the Nile, is less apparent ; indeed, the balance of evi
dence     seems to show that             it must   be the head     of the other great
river of Africa, the Congo.                 If     the Chambeze prove to         join the
Nile, then       the streams to the       Lake Liemba         become mere tributaries,
since the course of the Chambeze is by far the longer of the two.
The     feeders    of Liemba and the Chambeze                  rise,   however, side by
side, on the eastern plateau.                The Chambeze flows down into the
central    valley        through       Lake Bangweolo,          and     then   northward
through Lake Moero.    Livingstone describes Lake Moero as begin
ning 12 miles below the position of the town of Lunda, the capital
of the Cazembe (lat. 8° 40' S., long. 28° 20' E.), whose position
may be laid down with tolerable accuracy from the former journeys
of the Portuguese travellers.                Since Livingstone proceeded               north
from Cazembe's town, along the eastern     shore of Moero, in his
attempt to reach Ujiji in 1867, the great bulk of this lake must lie
to the westward of the meridian of Lunda, or about 120 miles to
westward of Tanganyika.                  Dr Livingstone       has seen the river at its
outflow from the lake, and also at the point                           where   it emerged
from the crack in the mountains of Rua, when, according to his
own observation,               the river turned       to    north-north-west     to form
Ulenge, a third lake or marsh in the country west of Tanganyika.
This north-westerly turn would carry the river quite out of the
direction of the Nile basin, and the higher side of the continent
being to the east,               the probability     is,   that the river continues to
curve to the west.
   Again, the valley of the Chambeze, in the plateau where Living
stone crossed         no doubt, one of the greatest hollows in the
                        it,   is,
high     land,     so     that      the height     of the river        bed   here may be
taken at 3000           feet, the lowest level of the limits which                Living
stone gives to the undulation of the plateau, or only 200 feet
above the level of Tanganyika.     Descending into the great
valley to Lake Bangweolo from the plateau, the Chambeze must

have a considerable              fall; from Bangweolo to Moero there must
be     a second     descent.           The Cazembe's country,                   which       extends
round     to the     south of Tanganyika,                        is described      as    flat,    and
its    rivers    are currentless            and stagnant.            If    Moero        were at a
higher level than Tanganyika, would not the river which                                      leaves
it take   a course over the level country instead                         of facing towards,
and    making its way through a crack in the mountains                                northward     ?
Seeing that the river                does force its way through these mountains,
the presumption           is,   that Moero      is   at   a   lower level than Tanganyika           ;
and    if this   be the case, the river              which       descends       from   it   through
the mountains can never again ascend to the level of the Nile lakes
to    join them, but must find some other course.
      With regard to the third advocated source, the Kassabi river, of
which     Dr Beke affirms            it   to be his belief that       it   is   the head stream
and upper course   of the Nile of Egypt, the difficulties of its joining
the Nile appear to be even greater than the last. The upper course
of this river only has been explored.     It springs in the Mossamba
Mountains, which are on the inner borders of Angola and Benguela,
its sources being          close to those of the Quango river,                    a   tributary of
the Congo.          The Kassabi           is   known to flow northward                as far as 8°
S.    to westward    of the capital of the Muata Tanvo.
   Dr Livingstone crossed its head on his journey from the Zambezi
to Loanda    and the reports which he collected from the subjects
                ;
of the Muata Yanvo's kingdom, all tend to prove, that whatever
direction its middle course may take, in its lower course the Kassabi
flows round to westward, and    joined by the Quango. The trader,
                                               is
Graca, who penetrated to the Muata Yanvo capital in 1846, says,
that " the territory of this chief    shut in by the great rivers
                                                      is
Kassabi and Lurua      tributary of the Kassabi)."
                                (a
                                                   " These rivers,"
he continues, "flow into the river of Sena" (the Zambezi).     The
latter part of this statement we now know to be incorrect      but,                          ;
taken as    a    whole,   it    indicates an easterly bend in the lower course
of the river to enclose the kingdom of the Yanvo on the west and
north, and to flow as           if   to the Zambezi.              The Hungarian traveller,
Ladislaus Magyar, has penetrated furthest of the three who have
visited this region, and his information seems to agree well with this
last.  He reports that the Kassabi, after forming the waterfall of
Muewe (in about 11° S. latitude), bends gently to northward                                   ;   but

130                  Proceedings     of the Royal           Society
further on        takes an easterly direction            in its lower course,                and
reaches a breadth      of   several miles at the place where              it   touches upon
the extensive lake Mouva or Uhanja.
  Now,       if   we turn the Kassabi        river eastward in latitude                  8° S.,
in agreement with the          above description, we find that                 it   meets the
position which Livingstone's           letters give to Ulenge,                  the lake or
marsh to which the Chambeze river flows, and whose waters                             Living
stone tells us by report, in his recent letters, are taken up by the
Lufira, a large river which, by many confluents, drains the western
side   of the great valley.
  Is not the Lufira, then, the lower               course   of the Kassabi, and the
Lake       Ulenge of Livingstone,          whose     waters are taken up by the
Lufira — the Uhanja lake of Magyar, which the Lower Kassabi
touches upon ?
  The      same difficulties which appear           in   the way   of the Chambeze
river and lake chain joining the Nile, hold also against the Kassabi,
which, from the above reports, would seem to join this river at Lake
Ulenge.
  Next, the question arises, if these rivers do not form a part of
the Nile system, where then shall we find an outlet for them ?
The answer to this is plainly, in the Congo river.
   The Congo        was described by the           Jesuit missionaries, who first
                                " violent
visited its mouth, as so                    and so powerful from the quantity
of its waters, and the rapidity of its current, that it enters                         the sea
on the west   side of Africa, forcing a broad and free passage (in
spite of the ocean) with so much violence, that for the space of 20
leagues it preserves its fresh waters unbroken by the briny billows
which encompass it on each side."                  In the introduction              to his nar
rative of his expedition to the Congo, Tuckey says,
                                                                      "   If the calcula
tion be true that the Congo, at its lowest state, discharges into the
sea two      millions of cubic      feet    of water in     a second,      the       Nile,   and
the Indus, and the Ganges, are but rivulets                    compared with              it,   as
the Ganges, which        is   the largest of the three, discharges only about
one-fifth     of that quantity at its highest flood."                 This estimate             is
greatly exaggerated, but Tuckey actually found that this vast river
has    a   width of two, three, or even four miles, whilst flowing with                         a
current of two or three miles an hour (p. 342), and this not at its
mouth, but inland beyond the mountainous coast regions.                                 Such    a

                      of Edinburgh,       Session 1869-70.                    131
  vast river    cannot be formed in a short course, but must have its
  rise far   in the interior of the continent.
     If we take the Kassabi river and its drainage to the Nile, where
 shall     we find    a sufficiently   lengthened      course  for the Congo ?
 Tuckey's unelaborated notes give the opinion that the "extraordi
 narily quiet rise of the river shows it to issue from some lake, which
 had received almost the whole of its waters from the north of the
 line;"      and again, he says, "   I cannot help thinking that the Congo
 will   be   found to issue from some large lake or chain of lakes, con
 siderably to northward of the equator."              The reason of Tuckey's
 supposition that the lakes, which evidently maintain the volume
 of water in the Congo, would be found north of the equator, is
 this, that he found       the rising of the river beginning on the first
 days of September.         At  the time of his journey little or nothing
 was known of the times of the rainy               seasons   in Central Africa
 from actual experience.         Since then the traveller Burton has told
 us   (in his account of the expedition to Tanganyika, R. G. S.
 Journal, vol. xxix.), that in the latitude of Tanganyika the rain
 sets   in at the end of August, lasting till May; and Livingstone
 says,   in his latest letter, that he did not proceed to Lake Bangweolo
 from the Cazembe's capital, where he arrived             about the middle of
 September, because the rains had         set  in. Lake Ulenge lies between
 these latitudes, so that the rise of the waters of the Congo on the
 first of September is perfectly explainable without the necessity of
 taking its reservoir lakes to the north of the equator ; if the lakes
 were     there, the rise of the Congo would        occur at a much earlier
period of the year, as we shall afterwards notice, and, indeed, the
space in which Lake Ulenge lies, seems to be the only one on the
continent whose rainy        season  would agree with the observed rise
of the Congo.
       3. The    Physical Features of   the   Lake Region and   the Lakes.
     The great highlands of the world encircle and turn their steepest
verge towards the Pacific and Indian Oceans; the slope is gentle
towards the great plains which surround the Atlantic and Arctic
Seas.       Africa is no exception   to  this rule, since it presents to the
Indian Ocean the abrupt descent of the plateau which extends
along its eastern       side from the Cape Colony to Abyssinia,         north

 132              Proceedings     of the Royal Society
 ward.   It is true that the whole of South Africa is a plateau, with
 a general elevation of about 3500 feet, and that the outer edges        of
it rise steeply from both coasts; but the eastern side is the higher
of the two, and the law of a general slope towards the Atlantic is
 maintained on its surface.       The Lake Region occupies the central
 part of the eastern,    or higher side, of the South African plateau,
and here the line of descent to the coast-land of the Indian Ocean
is marked continuously        from north to south  ; first by the south
ward continuation of the outer slope of the Abyssinian        table-land,
then near the equator by the edge on which the great mountain
peaks   of Kenia     and  Kilima Ndjaro rise; farther south by the
Rubeho Mountains, up which Burton           and Speke ascended     to the
plateau;   and then by the N'jesa Mountains,         which wall in the
 Lake Nyassa.      Farther south the cataracts of the Shire river,      35
miles in extent, show where this river tumbles over the edge of
the plateau, and the Zambezi breaks through        it at the narrows of
Lupata.     Below this steep edge the coast-land slopes     in gently to
the sea, and is diversified by wide plains or scattered    hill ridges.
   The high surface of the South African plateau inland is hollowed
out in the wide high valleys which contain its lakes and great
rivers.  The most northerly of these depressions in the Lake Region
is that of the great lake reported by the ivory trader Piaggia, who
approached within 60 miles of its northern shore.          This lake  ap
pears to lie  in a  high valley on the northern edge of the plateau
of South Africa, or rather in a recess of the northern lower land,
partly shut in by the slopes of the plateau southward, and the
mountain    range which the traveller saw rising to south-westward
beyond the lake, is perhaps only the steep northern edge of the
southern plateau here.
   The wide depression in which the Victoria Lake lies is shut in
eastward by the continuation of the Abyssinian highland into the
South African plateau.        This valley appears to include the basin
of the Bahari N'go, which is believed to be a vast salt marsh, or
perhaps a sort of backwater of the Victoria Lake, and its slope is
to north-westward, towards the angle       of the northern lower land
which is formed by the inner side of the Abyssinian highland run
ning north and south, and the northern edge of the plateau of
South Africa, which has a direction from east to west.

    Between     these   two northern      depressions lies the deeper          and
narrower valley      of the Nile, which contains the Tanganyika                and
Albert Lakes.        The beginning of this depression may be said to
be at Lake Liemba, which lies sunk 2000 feet down in the edge of
the plateau north of Lake Nyassa; then it opens out into a wider
valley to the east of Southern Tanganyika,             but again closes     in the
northern     part of that lake, and        is only a    little wider where      the
Albert Lake is sunk between the             edge  called the Blue Mountains
and the part of the plateau which separates                 this depression from
the higher one of the Victoria Nyanza.                  To south-west of Tan
ganyika the narrow valley of the Upper Nile appears to have an
opening into that one which contains the Chambeze and its lakes,
 made known by Livingstone,             in the low-lying country of the
 Cazembe.
    This valley of Bangweolo and Moero Lakes seems to be most com
 pletely surrounded on all other sides ; by the high plateau of Usango
 eastward, by a narrower portion of it called the Muchinga                  Moun
 tains southward, and again by the Kone Mountains,                 and a broader
 part  of the plateau, the copper country of Katanga,               on   the west.
 The only other opening       or outlet into this valley is apparently the
 rent in   the mountains of Rua, through which the river makes its
 escape   to join Ulenge. Westward is another and wider                depression
 — the wide high plain which forms the kingdom of                       the   great
  Muata    Yanvo,     watered by the Kassabi        River, and stretching       out
 between the Mossamba Mountains                where   the river rises, and the
 plateau of Katanga, which separates the Yanvo's from the Cazembe's
 valley.
     The Zambezi valley       closes   the Lake Region southward.              The
  Zambezi is the exceptional       river of Africa, since it breaks through
 the higher      side  of the plateau     to reach    the Indian Ocean.          Its
  sources, however, seem to be on the inner side of the plateau,
  springing    on the western    slopes   of  the Kone Mountains,        and flow
  ing first   to the south- westward.          The vast basin of this river
  (about 568,000 square miles) is comparable to that of the Volga,
  and would make more than one hundred river basins such as that
  of the Thames.
     On the west, the waterparting           of the Zambezi valley at Lake
  Dilolo is apparently but little     elevated above the plain      of the Muata
     vol. vn.                                                             ¦

side appears to rise to the range             of the Kone and Muchinga Moun
tains, and the valley becomes                deeper and narrower where it cuts
through the high edge of the plateau eastward,               to reach the coast.
  Lake Nyassa, a tributary lake of the Zambezi, lies in a deep
longitudinal hollow near the edge of the plateau, only retained
by the high barrier of the N'jesa Mountains.   The narrow valley
of the Shire river, which flows from     continues this hollow to

  The whole extent of water surface in this Lake Region       then            is
nearly 100,000 square miles, an area not far short of that of the
British Isles.   more definite notion of the great extent of these
                  A
inland seas of fresh water may perhaps be obtained,                if   we observe
that a direct passage across the Victoria Lake, from shore to shore
(in its presently believed extent), corresponds in length to voyage       a
across our North Sea from Hull to Rotterdam, or from the east-
most land of Scotland at Peterhead, to the Norway coast.
   The more important of the rivers of the Lake Region have been
noticed in speaking of the routes taken by the travellers who have
discovered them. One of the main hindrances to the exploration

                      of Edinburgh,    Session 1869-70.                      135
of South Africa, is the difficulty of making use of these rivers               as
highways into the continent.         The   coast rivers of the Lake Region,
 or, indeed,     of the whole of Eastern Africa,           are barred    at their
 mouths by the aggregated debris which they carry down, raised in
banks on the coast between the downward current of the river and
the opposing monsoon, or trade           wind, blowing       towards the coast.
 If this   bar is passed at the mouth,     still the navigation      even of the
largest rivers cannot cross the edge of the plateau where cataracts
and rapids form a new obstruction.           The   vast lakes of the interior,
and their great connecting rivers, however, present great lines of
navigable water, which in a higher civilisation               would be utilised
 for busy traffic, the line of the Nile basin in the Tanganyika              and
Albert lakes alone affording         an   unbroken voyage of about 900
 English miles.
    Piaggia, the traveller who       has been      nearest    to the great lake
 which lies to the north-west of the Albert Nyanza, reports a great
 river called the Buri, flowing to westward,            at some days' journey
 from   Kifa (his furthest point), and which           issues   out of his great
 lake.     The  same river has been     reached,    at some distance from its
 supposed     outlet, by the brothers Poncet (French ivory traders), who
 have   long trafficked in this region, and they express the opinion
 that this river unites the equatorial lakes with Lake Tchad, by
 means     of the Shari river. This they proposed to prove by an ex
pedition on it in boats.       The question, What becomes of this great
 river? which, at its outlet from the lake, is so large as to be only
passable in boats, is an interesting one.            It is certainly no tribu
 tary of the Nile, and the two most probable lower courses which
 it may have are those of the Shari to Lake Tchad, or of the Benue
river to the Niger.       If it ultimately proves to flow to Lake Tchad,
it will give    a striking evidence of the vast amount of evaporation
 which must exist in the region of that lake, since it has no outlet             ;
but the Benue river seems to be its most probable course, for at its
confluence with the Niger, the Chadda, or Benue, is the larger river.
The Ogowai river is also a possible lower course for the Buri, but
if the   lake reported by Piaggia be,     as we suppose,       on or beneath the
northern edge of the plateau of South Africa, it seems only natural
that the river from        it should seek the lower land to northward,
than   turn westward along the northern slope of the plateau.

4. The Nature      of the  Surface of the Lake Region Its Great Fertility.
    Africa, the only one of the continents which has a large extent
of land on each side of the equator, presents a series of zones, each
of which has a different nature of surface, and these belts correspond
very closely with one another on the opposite sides of the equator.
The central area of Africa, below the equator, in the zone of long
rainy seasons, or of almost constant rain, is a region characterised
by dense forests, and a most luxuriant overgrowth of vegetation,
comparable to that of the selvas           of the Amazon     River in South
 America, which occupy the same equatorial position on the globe.
To north and south of this forest            zone is a belt of less wooded
country, merging gradually into open cultivated            or pasture lands.
 Next,     these  grass   lands pass into the two great almost rainless
deserts of the Sahara in the north, and of the Kalahari southward.
 Beyond the deserts, at the extremities of the continent, the outer
 slopes of the Cape Colony in the south, and of the plateau of
 Barbary, the
                   " Tell " country, in the north, present a second zone
of fertile and cultivated country.
     The Lake Region extends from this central forest zone, in which
 the equatorial lakes are formed, through the more open belt           of less
 wooded country southward, as far as the Zambezi valley, and              this
 area     is almost everywhere        adorned with    the choicest natural
 varieties of shady forest, with luxuriant underwood, or clumps of
 trees with rich grassy       plains between.
                        5. Climate   of the Lake Region.
     Nowhere more than in this central region of Africa are the sub
  jects of temperature, rain, and winds, more         closely interwoven, or
  mutually dependent, the one upon            the other.  In the   passage   of
  this area beneath the sun, a low atmospheric pressure is produced
  by an ascending heat column, and by the condensation of vapour in
  this  ;  the winds flow into the ascending column, and bring with
  them the moist air of the ocean, which, condensing in copious
  floods of rain, reduces       the temperature, whilst causing a further
  opening, into which        the winds blow with increased power.          The
  area    of low pressure, with its attendant circumstance of winds        and
  rains, always tends towards that part of the continent             which    is

                   of Edinburgh,       Session 1869-70.                 137
vertically beneath the sun's rays, and thus moving up and down
the face  of the land within the tropics, gives the wet and dry, the
cold  and hot, seasons of the year in this region.            On the coast
the seasons    are sharply defined      : the continental  and the oceanic
monsoons      divide the year between either a single or a double
wet and   dry season    ; but in the high interior plateau in which the
lakes are situated,    the winds are drawn into the pendulating         area
of low pressure from the ocean, nearly throughout           the year, and it
is only when      extreme limits of the tropical       zone come directly
under the sun, that a higher barometric pressure, an outflow          of the
winds, and a consequent dry period, is experienced here.
   In the coastland under the equator, the country explored by the
German     traveller Brenner, the mean temperature of the year is
S5°-l (mean     of three daily observations), the highest observed tem
perature    (of 92°-8) having occurred in January, and the lowest
(73°-4) in May.       The rainy season here sets in with the south-east
monsoon in April, and lasts till the end of June.               The second
rainy season, which we shall notice, taking place farther south in
September and October, is almost lost at the equator.            The north
east monsoon       brings a cloudless sky of clear blue, and begins to
blow here    in November, lasting till March, and in this       season  rain
is never   thought of.
    At Zanzibar Island, six degrees south of the equator, the mean
temperature of the year is nearly 80° Fahr., rising in January to
an average of 83°, falling in July to 77°; and it has a double rainy
season, a stronger in March,     April, and May, when the column of low
pressure has passed this latitude in moving northward ; and again
in a weaker in September and October, when the low pressure
 passes  in its southward    course,   at which times the monsoon winds
change from the north-east,           blowing   out of Asia towards South
 Africa, to the south-west, blowing from Africa towards the Asiatic
 continent.     In  the low countries, beneath the edge of the plateau,
 about   Zungomero, Burton tells us that the rain is constant, except
 for a single fortnight in the month of January; at most times the
 sun shines    through a vale of mist with a sickly blaze and a blister
 ing heat,   and the overcharge of electricity is evinced by frequent
  and violent    thunderstorms,      so that   the climate   of Zanzibar    is
  equally ruled by these two great land masses.         On the Mozambique

138                 Proceedings       of the Royal Society
coast the winds are again ruled by the African continent only, and
the year is divided       into a dry and wet season.            From April    till
November the undeflected south-east trade wind blows upon this
coast,  and either from the lowness of the land or the shelter                  it
obtains from the high island of Madagascar, this wind brings the
dry season.      From November          to   March the north-east monsoon,
here   at its furthest     south limit, having         passed   over the warm
Indian   Ocean,    brings the rainy season.
   On the plateau inland,           the climate and seasons        are different.
The   mean annual temperature          of the table-land in the neighbour
hood   of the Victoria Nyanza was found by Speke and Grant to be
only about 68° Fahr., a temperature not greater than that of the
south coasts of the Mediterranean, a climate not unsuitable to
Europeans, since a hot summer in England is far more oppressive.
   The rainfall in this high region is also             an exceptionally    small
one for a tropical country, having been found to be only about 49
inches, or not so much as that of many parts of England, and this
may partly be accounted for by the fact that this part of Africa is
deprived of all rain from northerly winds, which come overland, and
the prevailing east winds lose much of their moisture on the high
eastern   slopes of the plateau before reaching this region.
   The traveller      Burton      gives an account of the very different
climate of the deeper       valley of the Tanganyika Lake.             Here the
rains divide the year into two unequal portions of eight and four
months, — namely, the wet monsoon, which commences with violence
in the end of August, and lasts           till May, and the dry hot weather
which completes the year.             During the wet monsoon (1858) the
prevalent    winds were       constantly changing.          The most violent
storms came up from the south-east or south-west of the plateau of
Umyamwesi, to westward of the lake.               Here he says that there are
but two seasons,      a summer and winter, and the rains begin in the
middle of November.           " The moisture bearing wind in this part of
Africa is the fixed south-east           trade,   deflected   into a periodical
south-west monsoon."            Further south in the Cazembe's country,
the rainy season      appears    from Dr Livingstone's letter to begin in
September,    and he says that the floods        in the country    west of  Tan
ganyika last    till May  or   June.    In the northern part of the Zambezi
valley   the traveller     Silva    Porto    found the rains set in on the

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1869-70.                        139
Arangoa     river in February, and they ended with him on the
eastern   side of the Nyassa in June.
    On the    Zambezi river in the Makololo district, Livingstone
observes    that the rain follows the course of the sun, since it falls
first in October and November when the sun goes over this zone
southward.       When the tropic of Capricorn is under the sun in
December, it is dry, and December and January are the months in
which the droughts are most severe in the countries              between the
 Zambezi and the Kalahari.          When the sun turns again to north
ward in February, March, and April, the great rains of this part
 of the Zambezi valley are experienced.
                                6. Population.
    The Lake Regions of Africa are well peopled. Behm, in his
 "
    Geographical Year-book," has estimated the population of that
 part of Eastern Africa, which lies between the equator, the line of
 Lake Tanganyika, the Cazembe's country,                and the Portuguese
 colonies on the coast, at 3,500,000.        This gives    a density of popu
 lation of about six to a square mile, but is apparently rather under
 than above the mark.        It is true that the slave trade must reduce
  and disturb the population      of this part of Africa to   a great extent,
 since many thousands of slaves are annually brought down to and
 exported from the harbours on the coast         ;  but, on the other hand,
 travellers in this region report a continuous         population.    Captain
 Grant describes the part of the Lake Region which he traversed             as
 too   thickly  peopled  to harbour many      wild animals ; the shores of
  Lake Tanganyika are, according to Speke, " thickly inhabited by
  numerous tribes ;" and in his voyage on Lake Nyassa, Livingstone
        " Never before in Africa have we seen anything like the dense
 says,
  population of the shores of Lake Nyassa, especially in the south.
  In  some   parts there seemed to be an unbroken chain of villages.
  On the beach of well-nigh every little sandy bay, black crowds
  were standing gazing at the novel spectacle         of a boat under  sail."
     The inhabitants of the Lake Region appear to belong entirely to
  the negro or negroid race, but are closed        in to north and south by
  peoples  of a different stamp.
     The Niam Niams who inhabit            the country     north of the lake
  reported by  Piaggia,   and west of the   Albert Lake, who had formerly

 140              Proceedings     of the Royal Society
 the reputation of being " half men and half dogs, with a fan-like
tail," and of having a disposition to eat their fellow-creatures,
prove, on nearer inspection      by the traveller Piaggia, to be men of
powerful, regular, and fine figure, of stately carriage, with bronze-
coloured skin, long hair, and thick beard, barbarous indeed in their
customs, but not cannibals.        They  are considered to be identical
with the interesting race of the Fellatah, the dominating people              of
the western    Soudan, or are perhaps a step between             these and the
Gallas of the east.
   Burton describes the peoples he met with between the east coast
and the Lake Region      : — " The Sawahili of the Zanzibar            coast are
sprung from the intercourse of foreign traders and emigrants, Phoe
nicians, Jews, Arabs, and Persians, with the African aborigines.
The Balonda     people of the kingdom      of  the    Muata Yanvo, to the
west   of Lake Tanganyika,      are almost pure negroes        ;   and between
these and the mixed east coast there is a tolerably regular grada
tion of negroid races from east to west, brought about partly by
long intercourse with foreign settlers, and in part by intermixture
with the non-negro races of North         Africa.       The high     road from
the coast to   Ujiji runs through comparatively quiet and peaceful
          " Cannibalism,"                    " is rare in Eastern Africa,
races."                       says Burton,
and results either from policy or necessity."
   The  aspect   of the great mass of this negroid race is not unpre
possessing.    They   are tall and well-made       mulattos, rather above
the European standard.        A giant or   a dwarf is never seen.           The
people of the maritime regions have         rough dirty skins of          a dull
pale black,  like that of diluted Indian ink       ;  from the central ele
vation of the eastern plateau the complexion improves, and further
inland the yellow skin, so much prized in Eastern Africa, appears.
From the Unyamwesi plateau to Tanganyika Lake, in those lower
levels where heat and humidity are- in excess, the people become
lamp black, without a shade of brown.          The negroid races appear
to extend down the outer slope       of the continent to near the Zam
bezi valley southward.
   Livingstone    speaks   of the negro peoples      of  the shores    of Lake
Nyassa ; and Silva Porto describes the natives he met with in the
northern watershed of the Zambezi valley as " hospitable negroes."
   The River Zambezi is nearly the boundary between the negroes

 or negroids    of the Lake Region,      and the Kaffir races of South
 Africa.
     South of the Zambezi       the kingdom    of Mosilikatze     has been
 made    up of the remains       of a number of formerly independent
 tribes conquered by the Matebele Kaffirs pushing northwards ; and
 Sekeletu's Makololo kingdom, in the Upper Zambezi valley, was
 founded by a former ruler who led this conquering       Kaffir tribe from
 the head   of the Orange river northward, and incorporated the van
 quished tribes with this one to form his kingdom.
     The most important kingdom of South Africa is the empire of the
 Muata Yanvo, whose        subjects are purely negroes.    The dominion
 of this potentate seems to reach from the Mossamba Mountains,             at
 the head of the Kassabi river westward, to the town of Shinte,           on
 the   Leeba   river, and the Muchinga Mountains southward,              and
 thence round to the southern part      of the Tanganyika Lake.
     The northern extent of this kingdom is as yet unknown.             The
 Muata Yanvo's empire includes that of the Cazembe, who is his
 vassal, and who rules for his sovereign over that part       of the king
 dom which      is separated from the main portion by the desert or
 mountainous country of Katanga.         The fertile and thickly    peopled
 area, known     to be under the sway of this great Central         African
 ruler, is far greater than any of the kingdoms of Western Europe,
and might be compared in extent to the united         bulk of France     and
Italy.
    In conclusion,    we may glance at the enormous labours          of the
great traveller Livingstone,      to whom the world is indebted       for so
vast a portion of its knowledge of the African continent, and whose
recent travels have given a fresh interest to this part of the globe.
The area of South Africa, which Livingstone has already explored,
and not only explored, but in great part surveyed with accuracy,
has an extent of about one million of square miles.       It is difficult to
form a correct notion of the space covered by such an area; and it
may help to give an idea of the work which has been accomplished,
if  we remember that the united areas of      all the western kingdoms
of Europe — France,    Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain — would scarcely
make up the extent      of land which Livingstone    has  virtually   added
to the known world.

     2.   On the Steady Motion of an Incompressible                                                    Perfect
               Fluid in Two Dimensions.                                        By Professor Tait.
   While discussing some of Mr Smith's applications of Maxwell's
ingenious idea of representing galvanic currents by the motions of
an imaginary fluid (ante, p. 79),   was led to the present investi   I
gation.         I     have since found that, as was only to be expected,                                           I
had been anticipated                       in    a great many                  of the results         I obtained —
especially         by Stokes, in the Trans, of the Cambridge Phil. Soc.
1843.          Still it appears to me that  have a few novel results to    I
communicate.
     If   \p   = const.             be    the equation of a current-line,                              Stokes    has
shown that —

                                                                                   JW'
where     /is       an arbitrary               function.
     By the integrationof this equation various singular results are
obtained, especially as to the nature of the families of curves which
can be lines of flow.
     The equation of lines of equal pressure is then formed, and from
it corresponding results                        are derived.                   A   curious result is obtained
when the motion is irrotational;                                     in which case there is a velocity-
potential           <f>,   and we        have—

The method                 is   also applied to certain cases of motion which, though
not steady, can be treated as                                   if       they were steady — viz., cases in
which      a    given state of motion                           is   propagated in the fluid by transla
tion or rotation                ;   so that to        a      spectator moving in                  a   given manner
in   a    plane parallel to the fluid, the motion appears to be steady.
Thus, for instance, we can treat as steady motion the case of two

    This is    a quaternion      investigation into the circumstances of fluid
motion,      especially with reference to the case of vortices.                     The
method       employed is very similar to that which                      I gave to the

 the equations       of fluid motion and of continuity              are —

 where     r is the density, and         P  the potential of the applied forces.
     The principal transformation                  is   effected    by    means   of the
 curious theorem in kinematics
 Thus, for instance, we have from the equation of motion
                                     V<D<ro- = 0,
 because              - 2j is obviously         a scalar.       The above theorem then
              <J*^P
  gives
  which proves that         if  <J <r  is ever   zero for any particle        of the fluid
  it must remain so for that particle.

   The following self-evident propositions were employed for the
deduction of several curious consequences —
   (a.)             4x  = (x + l)2      -   (x  - If,
or, " Every cube is the difference of two squares,               one at least  of
which is divisible by 9."
   (6.)   If
                               x2   +    y3  = &     ,
then

This furnishes       an easy  proof of the impossibility          of finding two
integers the sum of whose cubes is a cube.

1.   Facts as to Brain- Work ; in Illustration of the New and
    Old Methods of Philosophical Inquiry in Scotland.                         By
    Thomas Laycock, M.D.
    A few words in explanation       are needed.     In my summer          course
of lectures on Medical Psychology and Mental Diseases delivered
in the University,      I have to investigate the human mind in its
practical relations to the body, and especially         I   have to teach how
each influences the other, so that the physician, or any intelligent
person, may be able to modify these            relations     beneficially.    The
 starting-point   in  these   inquiries   is the fundamental         fact of ex
 perience, that no changes in the mind or the consciousness of what
 ever kind can or do arise, or continue, without a corresponding series
 of changes somewhere in the brain-tissue.           This fact being held as
 certain as the fact of gravitation, the solutions of the problems to
 be solved depend upon a knowledge of the relations which the
 two series   of phenomena      bear  to each other   ;   for which knowledge
 it is necessary to analyse and classify the varying states of con
 sciousness on the one hand, and the changes in the brain-tissue
 which correlate them on the other.            As to the last mentioned, it
 is certain that     they are vital;     they come,      therefore, under      the
 sciences of Life collectively termed biology.
     But all molecular changes in living tissues, of whatever kind
  they may be, and consequently those of the brain, can be brought
 also within the circle of molecular physics, for they can all be
  resolved   into motion of something,          whether we designate that
 something     an  atom,   a molecule, a vortex,        a ring,   or a centre of
 force.    They   are due,   therefore, to energy;         or, as distinct   from
 mind, to motor energy.          The Rev. Professor Haughton, M.D., of
Dublin University, was led by experimental research to the con
clusion, that as much motor energy is expended in brain-work in

146                  Proceedings         of the Royal Society
five hours as in muscle- work — say by a street-paviour                      —in ten hours.
Although all the changes going                   on in   living tissues may         be    finally
resolved into chemical changes, — a fact well illustrated by Dr W. B.
Richardson,        and by Professor          Crum Brown's           and      Dr Thomas R.
Fraser's valuable researches            into the connection               between        physio
logical action and chemical composition,                     lately communicated to
the Society, — they are distinct                 from those    induced in inorganic
matter by chemical affinity,            and hence the need             of connoting            the
energy by the term vital.Now the distinguishing character of that
energy, whether manifested in plants or in animals, is adaptation
of all motion to ends. Evolved in the brain, this vital energy is
manifested as mind, and life is thus spiritualised.                              I would     even
venture to say that matter is thus im materialised, for since all
statesof consciousness correlate motion of something, it is not the
connection of mind with mere ponderable or brute matter we have
to discuss, but      of mind with adapted motions in infinite variety.
All   external impressions received through the senses and exciting
states   of consciousness can be resolved into motions that can be
exactly measured,         in regard to impressions           on the eye and ear, and
all internal impressions passing from                    one part      of the brain or of
the body to another part, can be resolved also into an energy cor
relative with motion, termed vis nervosa.                     So that psychology by
this method        is,   in   one sense,     a   department of physics;             in   a   wider
sense    it   is
               a   science or philosophy of nature, and therefore differs
essentially from modern physiology, which                     is    only     a   restricted de
partment of physiology in the true and ancient sense of the word.
In fact, the method       I     adopt   is   an adaptation     of the ancient Aristo
telian method to modern philosophy, and in adopting                                it   with me,
the Faculty of Arts of the University would only return to                                a   for
mer arrangement of work.                Sir William Hamilton               observes on        this
point    to the effect, that " Aristotle's treatise On                       the   Soul being
(along with his lesser treatises                 on Memory and Reminiscence,                    on
Sense and its Objects, &c.) included                 in the Parva Naturalia, and
he having declared that the consideration                     of the soul          was part     of
the philosophy of nature, the science of mind was always treated
along with physics."*

                      of Edinburgh,        Session 18(59-70.                  147
     The cause    of this change in Faculty-work           was, in fact, the  rise
of different methods of philosophical            inquiry named the reflective,
which discarded        all observation and experimental research what
ever.     Sir William Hamilton explicitly taught that the only ex
ternal condition needed for philosophical               inquiry is a language
"              of embodying         the abstractions of philosophy without
    capable
figurative ambiguity," — a condition not yet attained, however, nor
likely to be.       "With      this one condition,"      Sir William    declares,
" all is given    ; the philosopher requires for his discoveries no pre
liminary preparations,         no apparatus     of instruments and materials
.    ...   it is only  necessary     that the observer enter into his inner
self [and here is truly a figurative ambiguity of language] to find
 there all he stands in need of."* Hence the reading and writing
of books, and discussions of opinions, are the proper results of
 reflective inquiry.       It was    to his extreme devotion to the literature
 of philosophy       that was due        that lamentable palsy of the sign-
 making organs, the right hand and speech-muscles, termed aphasia,
 with which he was afflicted, for these were overworked in the acqui
 sition of that immense erudition which distinguished                 him.    The
 locality of the brain-disorder in         these cases is  in the anterior  lobes,
 more especially the posterior third of inferior frontal convolution.
      Although the principles of the reflective method there laid down
  by its greatest modern           master exclude observation and experi
  mental research,       Sir William Hamilton did not neglect physio
  logical inquiry. My own researches into the reflex and unconscious
  functions of the brain, made twenty-five years ago, were.rewarded by
  his highly valued approval and friendship, because he saw in them
  the physiological       side   of his doctrine of "latent" consciousness;
  but the kind of inquiry he followed was physiological in the re
  stricted sense of a physiology of the human brain, and not in the
   wider sense of a science           of nature.    But  I  do not advocate this
   restricted method as the best or even a true method of philosophical
   inquiry, nor do    I wish     to defend the errors to which it leads.           I
   speak   only for my own method           as just explained.
      Matters    being thus,      it interested    me to read the manifesto       of
 principles and methods which my reverend and respected colleague,

148                   Proceedings         of the Royal        Society
the Professor of Moral Philosophy, gave forth when he took posses
sion of his chair in November 1868, and which he published under
the title of        "Moral Philosophy               as a Science and         a    Discipline."
In this      essay he specially criticised            the physiological          method, and
in such a way that the Professor of Physiology thought                                     it ex
pedient to        publicly controvert his views.             The facts   I       have to place
before       the Society having a reference to this criticism,                       I   quote    it.
Professor Calderwood said,                " There     are evidences    of great activity
on the part        of upholders of       a sensational philosophy, differing                   only
in its modifications from that which Scotland formerly rejected
under the leadership of Reid and Stewart.       In conjunction with
this revival of sensationalism, there is eagerness not only to com
bine physiological           and    mental science, but even to question the
sufficiency of our investigations regarding the facts of consciousness
— to make nerves and muscles the only safe approach to a science
of mind, — and to proclaim the necessity of making physiology the
basis    of psychology.            The    consequence       of this    is,   not only that
mental philosophy            is   being encumbered with irrelevant investiga
tions concerning such physical processes as mastication and respira
tion, and such physical experiences as toothache and cramp in the
stomach,         but we are involved in all the hazard connected with the
use     of   a   false method."      I        gather from this sentence                  that my
reverend colleague, however opposed                       or misinformed          he may be
as to    the physiological         method, certainly means not only to defend
and resolutely maintain the sufficiency                   of the reflective method                as
laid down by his great master, but to assert its superiority over the
Aristotelian        method of observation and research.                  Now,        it   is   upon
these points that       I     join issue with him.           I   shall select two prob
lems for illustration,            taken from my respected colleague's own de
partment, viz., the nature of belief and of personal identity, being
guided to the selection by his own declaration, viz.,
                                                      " The
                                                            supposi
tion that physiology can lead us to philosophy of mind,                              is   doomed
to rejection by       all   to whom      it    is   clear that our personality             is    not
essentially connected with our body, which                       is   only       a   temporary
dwelling," &c.              In this condemnation of physiology                    is     included
the assertion of       the psychological proposition that mind, considered
as an energy or principle,               is   separable    from life, and that            it   only
occupies the living body as              a    temporary tenant.       Now, the holders

of this opinion have, in common with the physiologists, a belief in
a future life, and follow two methods of inquiry as to that truth of
religion, viz., the confirmatio veri and the inquisitio veri.                The
spiritualists (so-called) have adopted the latter or scientific method,
the orthodox philosophers the former.               To this end they state
certain propositions       as unquestionable.      Firstly, that every man
assuredly believes he is a mental unity, one, or Ego            ; secondly, that
" our thinking Ego . . . is
                                        essentially the same thing at every
period of its existence," — I quote Sir William Hamilton, vol. i.
p. 374 ; and,     thirdly, that the evidence upon which these assumed
beliefs are    founded is sufficient, being that of consciousness itself.
In other words,       I feel assured   that  I am one and the same        person
that    I ever   was, and therefore     I  am   one and    the same.      Is this
evidence sufficient ?        Can we rely absolutely and       without    need  of
 verification upon the veracity of consciousness manifested as belief?
 To answer this question clearly, it is necessary to understand how
 beliefs arise and are modified.        Now, since according to the funda
 mental fact that every state of consciousness coincides with corres
 ponding     molecular     change in brain-tissue,      we   conclude that all
 beliefs, being states of consciousness, must be coincident with such
 changes.      Is this conclusion true in fact    ?   First,  as to the Ego.    A
 man, like other mammals, is one in body — a corporeal unity — in
 accordance with the fundamental biological law of organisation ad
 hoc.    The belief that    he is one, or Ego, bodily, is founded upon his
 knowledge of this fact.         The belief that   he is a mental unity, or a
 thinking Ego, correlates,       as I shall shortly show, the unity of cere
 bral function      manifested in the various states of consciousness of
 the man at any given moment.               But the belief that this Ego,
 whether corporeal or mental, is essentially the same thing at every
 successive period of a man's existence, includes wholly different
 phenomena, since       it refers to past time, and consequently implies a
 reminiscence       of what it was at     some   moment of past time, or in
 past time generally.          Now, reminiscence      is proveably dependent
 upon a recording vital process, whereby we are enabled to know in
 time present by virtue of the so-called association of ideas— what we
  were, and thought       and did in past time.      If  there be no record or
  memory, or     if there  be a record, but no association of ideas so as to
  induce reminiscence,        then there is no knowledge of past mental
     VOL. VII.                                                          u

150                 Proceedings of     the  Royal Society
states.    What is essential, therefore, to belief in continuous personal
identity as a mental state, is that consecutive continuity of vital
processes which is necessary       to reminiscence, and not a continuous
consciousness, as is the doctrine of reflective philosophy.            Memory
in this     sense    may, and does      extend   in   fact    beyond  the  con
sciousness, so that changes may and do take place in the conscious
ness which are due to preceding records made without consciousness,
 but which not being for that reason           recognised as belonging        to
 past    mental life, are believed to be intuitive.         Memory in the in
 dividual from this point of view, and considered as a vital process,
 has its exact counterpart       in what may be termed memory of the
 species of both plants and animals, in virtue          of which consecutive
 continuity of vital process through the seed or germ is maintained,
 and ancestral qualities reproduced in offspring.
    Such being the philosophy of belief, considered as the result             of
 brain- work, it is not difficult to understand why the philosophy of
 morals, in so far as it is founded on identity of belief simply, or
 orthodoxy, and not upon knowledge, is chaotic            ;  nor how it is that
 all the efforts   made to secure identity    of mere belief, independently
 of knowledge of the order of nature, whether by education or
 otherwise, must fail.
    I  shall now illustrate    these views by morbid or insane beliefs.
 The reflective philosophy,     as is well-known,    discards all inquiry into
 aberrant mental states     ;  with much the    same propriety, however, as
 an astronomer would discard the observation            of planetary   observa
 tion  :  in the inductive method       these are of the greatest value as
 experiments of nature.        By examining every kind of result of the
 molecular change as manifested by others, and comparing                  these
 with    our own, we are enabled in truth         to study them as directly
 manifested to our own consciousness.           Hence all facta, all writing,
 all  art, and all conduct, however normal or abnormal, are the appro
  priate facts for inductive inquiry.       To illustrate    the method in this
 direction, and at the same time to show the true relations of belief,
  I place before the    Society the portrait of a house-carpenter painted
 by himself, with a descriptive legend describing himself as three
             viz. — 1. George Elliot, his true personality.        2.
                                                                       " George
 persons,

  the  world — the true    and  lawful God."      The reflective philosopher

                          of Edinburgh,                Session 1869-70.                            151
would        think it      a sufficient explanation                to say that the man is a
lunatic.          He should          remember,          however,     that he owes this ex
planation to the physiological method.                            Formerly, the explanation,
according to the reflective method was, and with many still                                  is,   that
the lunatic        is    either inspired or else possessed by                 a   spiritual being.
The inductive philosophy, starting from the fundamental fact that
all   states of consciousness               of   a    man, however manifested, cannot be
manifested independently of vital processes, lays down the law that
in the living        man      Life    and    Mind       are inseparable,      and consequently
that the "thinking                   Ego"        is   the man      himself.       Now, although
his person          is   double, whether as to limbs or brains, his corporeal
condition          of unity     affected thereby in
                               is    no more           healthy state              a
than the unity revealed in consciousness — the one  being the reflex
of the other.            His two brains           act together so as to attain the            unity
of    consciousness,          just    as   his two eyes act in unity of vision                ;     but
as he       may    see   double when the two eyes act disjoin tly, so may he
have        a double consciousness                when       the two brains act         disjointly.
Whether he believes, or whether he doubts that he sees two objects,
or that he          is   one or two persons, depends                  upon those molecular
conditions upon which the belief and doubt of the moment depend.
Or, again, just as an object of vision may, from disorder of the
corresponding brain-tissue, appear to                        a   man to be something wholly
different, as when his friend appears                          to be the devil, constituting
what        is   termed   a   hallucination, so his personality, from disorder of
the corresponding brain-tissue, may appear to be something wholly
different, and he may chance to have an hallucination                                   that he          is
the devil.          It   appears probable, therefore, that although                     a   man may
have many and various delusions as to his state of mind and body,
he    will rarely         exceed three distinct              and fixed delusions as to his
personality, viz., one resulting from disorder of each brain acting
disjointly,        and one from disorder of both acting conjointly.                           Under
the restrictions stated, the result of numerous observations                                I      have
made        is   in accordance         with this view.             So much for the break-up
of    unity of consciousness by brain disorder. It
      the                                              obvious                     is               at   a
glance that these diversities of belief as to personal identity                                      are
associated with brain changes                     involving memory and reminiscence;
otherwise,         when       Elliot       came    to    belief in his royal birth and
                                                         a
parentage, he would                  also remember,          to the confusion of the belief,

 152                Proceedings        of the Royal Society
that he is and always has been George              Elliot the house-carpenter           ;
or, at least, a reminiscence, however vague,                would induce doubt.
But no such results followed, and                the    belief is fixed and un
wavering.
    These considerations apply to belief only; but to understand the
questions at issue better,       I shall inquire how a man comes to doubt,
and what is essential to as accurate              knowledge     as    he can attain
under the circumstances.            For this purpose      I shall    select the state
of consciousness known           as dreaming.         No well-informed inquirer
 now holds the doctrine that in that state man is inspired, or that
the soul or mind acts independently                of the body      ;  it is admitted
that every such change of consciousness as constitutes dreaming is
directly dependent upon molecular changes in the brain-tissue.                       In
accordance    with the physiological law already laid down, the dreamer
believes in the reality of his dreams,               however absurd         they may
be, and however far removed from the normal conditions the mole
cular changes.        It  is only when he awakes,         and the normal condi
tion is   restored,    that he doubts or disbelieves.           Now, an analysis
of these    purely     physiological     phenomena shows         that those states
of consciousness which in the waking condition                    of    the brain are
either   reminiscences        or anticipations,       have in dreams           no true
element of time, either past or to come            ;   they are either wholly of
the present,     or have no true relation either to time or to space.
Memory, therefore, as the knowing              reminiscence of past states of
existence, and judgment             as  the perception        of the future,        are
abolished.     Memory        of the   past is abolished, on the one               hand,
because    the association of ideas upon which that faculty depends,
and which      began at some past time, is abolished              ;   while, on the
other hand, there is no knowledge of any existing                     personal rela
tions to time and space, because the senses being shut, there is no
perception possible of these           relations.      Hence the merest phan
tasms of the imagination,            admittedly      due  to molecular changes
induced under these           conditions,    are  received as verities.            Reid
relates how, on     a   certain occasion, when he slept with a blister on
his head, he believed he was being scalped by Indians.                       It is only
on awaking, when memory, and external                    perception, and normal
associations of ideas are restored, that a true knowledge of the
fallacious character of the beliefs can be attained.                     Hence it is

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1869-70.                           153
clear that these conditions          are necessary to a    right helief in   con
tinuous personal identity.          These conclusions are strictly applicable
to all  hallucinations and beliefs of morbid origin.              Many persons
have    delusive     beliefs    during    the waking    state as transient       as
dreams.      This is very common in the brain-failure               of old age.
Delusive beliefs,       more    strictly insane, may      come  and go in like
manner in the earlier stages of an insanity.             I had a patient   under
my care, in whom         they came       on only when he was       in a heated
room, and who could recover from them by the cold douche applied
to the face.      In  cases   like George Elliot, the morbid state is best
described as a     fixed dream.       When those molecular changes, which
coincide with the mnemonical records of his daily life, of things done,
succeed    each other, he truly believes he is George Elliot, a house-
carpenter;      but when the mnemonical records of his dream-life,
and which are       wholly dissociated from the former,        are presented to
the consciousness, then the associated           personality is presented    also,
and, for the time being, he believes as            firmly he is another   person
 than George      Elliot.    These delusive states may have every degree
of duration.         In   certain    kinds   of waking     somnambulism,        the
individual     lives   an actual life, as two     wholly dissociated    persona
lities, for hours or days alternately,            the mnemonical      records of
the two    being quite     as dissociated as dreaming and waking life         ;  or
they may occupy only a few moments, as in the artificial               somnam
bulism induced mesmerically, where the brain has been so acted
on that     the patient is      made    to hold the most absurd beliefs, — to
believe,   in short, whatever       he is told is real.    In this way Sir       J.
 Young Simpson         changed the personal identity of two ladies in
 regard to the husband of one of them, s0 that the unmarried
 believed she was the married, and vice versa.               From   these   facts,
 and   they might be multiplied to any extent, it is clear that the
 notion or belief of personal identity is not due to mind                 in the
 abstract, considered as an immaterial             substance acting in entire
 independence of life and organisation, but to mind in the concrete,
 as  inseparably     associated,    not with brute inert matter, but with
 the motions      and   forces upon which life depends.           This,  I   need
 hardly say, is no new doctrine           of philosophy,   whether profane or
 biblical.    The earliest record of Scripture affirms that man only
 became a    living soul after the breath of life        was breathed into his

154                  Proceedings     of the Royal Society
nostrils  ; and St Paul, the philosophic         apostle,    adopting this view
to explain     the resurrection,      uses  the biological      analogy    of the
continuous     life of the    species  of plants through the germ, to indi
cate   how the individual or personal life of man may be continued
independently       of consciousness, and how it may            be evolved    into
consciousness at some future time, plainly adopting thereby the
Aristotelian    doctrine of the soul.
    Many attempts have        been made to verify the separate       existence  of
the soul, whether as a religious dogma or a philosophical                doctrine,
and,   of necessity, all    have failed.   I have placed      before the Society
an   illustration of     these  attempts, by the so-called spiritualists,       to
prove the fact     of an independent personal identity.          It is a drawing,
by a member of an eminent literary family, of the spirit-emblem
of a distinguished      and much esteemed fellow of this Society.            Here
are published       representations of like emblems,           taken from     Mrs
Newton Crossland's " Light in the Valley."                 The   seeress, we are
told, who beholds these          mystical   appearances,     describes them as
appearing to her in colours of liquid light, with the utmost clear
ness, more rich and radiant         than earthly jewels.        These emblems
are usually seen to be situate behind            the persons to whom they
belong, the centre of the emblem rising just above the head, and
occupying     a circumference       of several   feet.    They   are the badges
by which persons are recognised in the spirit-world,                  even while
they remain on earth.            To the production of these emblems a
                              existence of " spirits
                                                        "
belief in the separate                                      is essential —doubt,
 like the waking        from a dream,      either   prevents     or dispels    the
phantasies.       Physiologically they differ in no respect from the
delusions of George Elliot, or of dreamers. The verification of
 any belief means the investigation          of the order of nature, so as to
determine whether the conclusions             presented    to the consciousness
as brain-work      coincide with the natural order of events.            To those
 who are confident that they can assuredly believe in their own
 eyes, the sun undoubtedly        moves, and the observer is motionless,
 but a verification of the conclusion shows that the motion is in the
 observer, and the sun is motionless.
                                                   Now, when a spiritualist
 attempts to verify his belief in spirits, he ignores the fact that his
 belief is due to molecular changes out of, at least, direct relation
 to any spiritual influence, except that which
                                                           constitutes his own

spiritual    nature, and is thus led to esteem           the mere phantasms
of his own imagination         as proof    of external agencies which may
exist, but which,     by the terms of the hypothesis, cannot be veri
fied.     Resolved    into their ultimate       elements, all     the so-called
proofs of spirit-life, when stated bona fide, are simply presentations
to the consciousness       of the inquirer's own brain-work,          as delusive
as   those of the lunatic      or the dreamer.       It   has been commonly
said that this class of inquirers         are, for the most part, either of
weak     mind, or credulous, or ignorant.         But this is not      so.   Here
are   delineations    of the od-force, as investigated by Baron von
Reichenbach, a      skilled scientific inquirer.       He never saw what is
here   represented as the manifestations of the od-force, he simply
shows      what   was   described to him        as  such    by   hysterical    and
morbidly nervous women            ; and   if they be true as descriptions,
they are only representations to the consciousness of phantasmal
brain-work.       Some   of these so-called spirit operations are instruc
tive   illustrations   of  aesthetical  automatic     action   of  a cultivated
brain.      The emblem of a fellow of this Society, drawn by a person
of high culture, is contrasted well with the uncouth mystical
emblems of an uneducated female lunatic before me. I was assured
by my late friend       David Ramsay Hay, and no one was more com
petent to judge, that it is exactly true to the geometrical principles
of form and colour.
    In   the delusions     of George     Elliot  we have     an illustration     of
another     interesting   result of brain-work, the ideational evolution
of the intuition of the infinite,       a subject so much and so earnestly
discussed by reflective philosophers, and which is equally as capable
of biological illustration     as the preceding.
 2.   On Change of Apparent Colour by Obliquity of Vision.
                   By Robert H. Bow, C.E., F.R.S.E.
    I  discovered the peculiarity       of chromatic vision, which          is the
 subject of this paper, in the month of January, when                 conducting
 some experiments upon the perfection          of definition   at different parts
 of the retina; and      I may   introduce the subject by first referring to
 these experiments.
    In the case of ordinary sensation          seated   in the skin, there are

156                Proceedings of the Royal Society
two offices performed by the nerves — first, that of informing the
mind of the fact of the contact or impression being made                   ; and,
second, that    of giving    more   or less minute      information as to the
locality of the sensation.       Professor Weber experimented upon the
latter    power, by testing     the least distance        apart at which      two
objects touching the skin of any part of the body could be felt as
two distinct    sensations  ;  and, as you are aware, this tactile         power
bears no constant proportion to the mere power              of feeling   a sensa
tion of contact.      For instance, the back of the hand is perhaps
more sensitive to     a simple contact than the tip of the finger, but
Weber found that the points of contact are required to be fourteen
times further apart at the back of the hand than at the tip of the
finger, before they can be distinguished as separated.
   Now, a very strong analogy exists between              these   two functions
of ordinary sensation         and   corresponding      offices   of the retina.
Objects seen obliquely are not strikingly different in brightness
from the same seen in the direction of the optical axis, but the
power of definition       (apart altogether from mere            optical causes)
varies immensely.        I attempted      to investigate this defining     power
for different parts of the retina by a method exactly analogous to
Weber's    — namely, by inspecting two white            spots    on a blackened
card, and determining,       for different angles of obliquity and direc
tion, the greatest distance from the eye at which these spots could
be detected    to be double.     But    I soon  found that, when the vision
is very oblique, there is a     puzzling feeling of uncertainty         as to the
result  ;  and it occurred  to me to assist the judgment         by substituting
for the white spots objects of contrasting colours.
   On attempting       to put this idea into practice,         I  made   the im
portant discovery, that when coloured objects are inspected under
oblique vision, the colours are at the same time reduced in inten
sity, and changed in character        :  thus, scarlet  becomes     successively
orange, yellow,      and whitish-yellow,        according to the obliquity        ;
green,  of  a medium     character, tends to become white, and violet to
become blue.
   In experimenting upon the subject, it is         best to place the coloured
object obliquely on the nasal side of one eye, the other eye being
closed  ; much smaller angles of obliquity bring about the phenomena
when seen on this side of the eye, and we get            rid of any complicity

                          of Edinburgh,             Session       1869-70.                                   157
with the insensitive spot where the optic nerve joins the retina.                                                I
may point out here, however, an experiment that shows the general
peculiarity,       and also the excess of change that takes place when
the object is on the nasal side compared with the other.                                               Against
a dark-coloured               wall hold up, at arm's-length,                  an orange-coloured
object of three or four inches in diameter.                             We        suppose      it held by
the right hand            ;    then turning the face rather towards                          it,   look at       a
point in the wall eighteen or twenty inches to the left of the object                                            ;
and now closing the eyes alternately,                       it   will   be observed           that, when
the right eye        is       open, the object      will   appear       of nearly its full orange
colour, but when the right eye                      is   closed and the left opened, the
object      will    assume       a   pale, sickly, yellow tint           ;    and      if   the point in
the wall be taken further                    from the object, the colour seen                              by   the
left   eye   will approach nearer to white.                      To     cause the same amount
of change to the right eye, the obliquity must be very much greater.
Another mode of conducting the experiment, as depending upon
the contrast of effect upon the two sides of the eye,                                  is   this   :   Choose
two objects of the same                      colour, place these two or three inches
above or below            a     mark on the wall, close one eye, and with the
hands withdraw                 the objects equally away on either side from the
central position,               the eye being rivetted to the mark on the wall                                   ;
it   will then      be noticed that, relatively,              the object on the nasal side
of the observing                eye undergoes          a   rapid change of tint or colour.
But,   it    may be repeated,              the most satisfactory mode of examining
the changes          is   to use one         eye and observe with the coloured object
on the nasal side of                 it,   the eye being held steadily upon                            a   mark,
which may or may not                  be   of the   same colour as the object.                     Observed
in this way, the following changes will                          be   presented —      :
     First. The colours               lose    more or less their chromatic intensity,
and approach nearer to white or black, according                                  as   they are placed
upon    a    dark or light ground.               But extreme            red   is   especially marked
as   losing illuminative power,                 as well as chromatic character.                            Ultra
marine blue, on the contrary, appears to lose very little by oblique
vision   ;   it    assumes       a   lighter blue hue.
     Second.       The colours undergo              a    change of chromatic character.

               observed at an obliquity of about 30° on the nasal side,

158                  Proceedings         of the Royal Society
             appears     orange   ;  at 40° to       50°   it looks of    a somewhat
             meagre      yellow, beyond this a pale yellow.                As   seen  at
             the outside of the eye, the orange only appears when the
             obliquity reaches 80°, and the yellow at 90°.
      b.  Some      orange    colours show the change very markedly                   to
              yellow, and to nearly white.
      c.  Emerald       green. — This, at 40°, becomes            nearly white, gene
              rally yellowish.
      d.    Ultramarine. — This         is very persistent, visible        at 40° as a
              blue.
      e.  Pink, of      a purplish      cast. — This in day-light, when placed
              on a    white ground, appears — even at a very moderate
              obliquity — a purplish         blue ;  if placed on a black ground,
              it assumes     a lavender blue colour.
                  This change of purples and pinks to blue is one of the
              most striking ; perhaps the best way of witnessing it is to
              use two thicknesses of cobalt blue glass, fortified with a
              pink or purple      one, so as to allow both extremities            of the
              spectrum to pass freely.            This    screen,   held before a gas
              light,   appears by direct        vision of    a  fine pink colour, but
              by   a moderate obliquity it is reduced to             a bright blue.
      /. A bluish-yreen         glass,     held in front of      a gas  light, appears
               to become blue by oblique vision.
       g.   A yellowish-jreen        glass becomes          by oblique     vision more
               decidedly yellow.
                 Remarks and Speculations on            the Phenomena.
    Under oblique vision the purples or pinks become blue, and the
 extreme red becomes dull.              It would    appear, therefore, that towards
 the margins of the retina the sensation of blue is less reduced in in
 tensity than that of red, and a step in the explanation of the results
 is this  :  the red in the purple or pink becomes a dull orange or
 yellow under oblique vision          ;   this gives rise to the sensation of white
 light when combined with                a part of the blue, and reduces          the re
 maining       part of the blue to         a paler cast.       The  same    explanation
 applies to a blue-green becoming              blue —the     green becomes white or
 pale yellow under oblique vision, and so dilutes the blue ingredient
 to a paler shade.

                           of Edinburgh,                Session 1869-70.                          159
     The second observation that may                          be made upon the              results   is,
that by oblique vision the various colours are seen under the same
conditions as in the most common form of colour-blindness, wherein
there are really only two colour-sensations, the upper half of the
spectrum, from blue-green up to violet, and including pinks and
purples, appearing blue                  ;    and   the lower half,         from yellow-green
down through yellow, orange, and scarlet, to bright red, appearing
yellow  ;     and in such colour-blindness                    the extreme red         is   frequently
very dull.           We   may, therefore, expect the discovery                     of      some simi
larity in the conditions of the central part of the retina of an eye
affected with this form of colour-blindness,                        and the marginal parts
of the retina of          a    normal eye.
     Before concluding,             I     would venture to connect the discovery
with     an     existing         theory of colour-sensation,                as   it   may help to
establish that theory, should                       a   prediction the connection leads to
be found to be correct.
     The figure         here        given shows          a   section of part of the retina
              Now,     has been suggested that
(Kolliker).                     V, it
each of the layers                  G,
                                receptive of the
                                                R,
                         and                    is
sensation of light, — the layer  being affected     V
by the more refrangible rays blue and violet,                          R
being      affected       by the less           refrangible yellow,
orange, and red, while the central layer                           G   is
affected by the central parts of the spectrum,
blue, green, yellow, and orange                     ;   and this would
account for the approximate                         achromaticity      of
the eye, for when the eye                      is   arranged for the most acute vision,
the focus of blue rays will correspond with                          V,     of green rays with
G, and of scarlet rays with R.
     But   it   is   well known that the eye does not                   see      any colour quite
              there            always white light present, or, in other words, one
                       V, is
purely;
of the layers,                 G,   or   R,   cannot be agitated or excited without the
others     partaking to some extent in the excitation.                                Now, there      is
a probability that the degree of freedom with which one layer may
transmit its special sensation without one or both of the others
participating,         to an important              degree,    in the excitement, depends
in part upon the maintenance of    considerable interval between

160                Proceedings    of the Royal Society
become      more or less perfectly obliterated, and it is evident that no
simple sensation of red or green could be felt, but only a colour-
sensation, which     corresponds with the excitement of both of these
layers, which is yellow.      It may, therefore, be worth the attention
of anatomists, skilled in working with the microscope, to ascertain
if any decided reduction of the interval G to R takes place towards
the margins of the normal retina, or has place in the central part
in eyes that have shown, during life, the commonest form            of de
fective vision of colour    ; we should also    expect  a reduction of the
 interval   V to G, but  to a less decided degree.     In   the case of an
eye completely colour-blind,       we should look for the coalescence    of
 the three layers into one, unless the defect were accounted for by
 the absence or paralysis of two of the layers.

 mitted to the Council, and passed by them as not containing anything
 objectionable, before being mentioned in the Billet.
     2.   The Society shall not take up any matter which has not been

        1. Remarks on the Theories of Capillary Action.              By
                      Edward Sang, Esq., F.R.S.E.
      That theory of capillary action, which      seems   to have satisfied
  the greater number of physicists, is founded on the assumption
   that the particles of a fluid are separated    by distances immensely

                       of Edinburgh,               Session 1869-70.                            161
great in comparison with their magnitudes, and that these particles
attract each other, —the sphere, however, of their attraction extend
ing to              infinitesimally small in comparison with the
              a distance
observed disturbances of the fluid-level.
      The accommodation of this theory                       to the actual phenomena is
accomplished          by long operations, comprehensible                      only by those
who     familiar with the higher calculus.
        are                                                           The object of the pre
sent paper is to examine this theory in the light afforded by a
general knowledge of the leading laws of mechanical science. For
this purpose, the author proceeds                    to analyse the ordinary pheno
mena of the rise of water round                     a piece      of clean     glass which has
been plunged into it.               Assuming        a   fluid particle situated upon the
 inclined surface, he observes               that, according to the hypothesis of
 an infinitesimally small sphere of attraction, this particle is beyond
 the direct influence of the glass             ;    the only other influences to which
 it   is subjected are gravitation            and       the attraction        by the adjacent
 fluid particles.
      Now, according to this same hypothesis, the particle is attracted
 by that part of the fluid which is within a small sphere described
 around it      ;   but the curved surface, having its radius of curvature
 infinitely greater than the radius of this sphere, may be regarded
 as flat within the range of attraction, and therefore the solicita
 tion, to which the particle is exposed, must be exerted in                               a   direc
 tion normal         to the surface.         By     a more       minute examination, the
 author       shows that,     if the radius of the                sphere      of attraction      be
 reckoned as a differential of the first order, any deviation from nor
 mality must belong to the third order of differentials — that                                    is,
 must be of an order infinitesimally smaller than the infinitesimally
 small sphere of attraction.
      Thus the only two solicitations                    to which        the particle can be
 subjected are, the attraction               of the fluid             exerted in     a   direction
 normal to the surface, and gravitation.                        Now,    it   is   impossible that
 the resultant        of   these    two solicitations           can    be normal to the sur
 face  ;   but no fluid can be in repose                if   the attraction exerted upon          a
 particle at its surface be not normal to that surface, wherefore, the
 author of the paper concludes, the infinitesimally-small-sphere-of-
 attraction-hypothesis             is   untenable.
      On considering the hypothesis of attraction generally, the author

162               Proceedings    of the Royal Society
proceeded   ro remark that, in order to prevent the condensation
which would result, we must suppose some resistance to the farther
approach of the particles, which         we may     typify by    a  repulsion  ;
and that these tendencies — the       attractive and the repulsive — must
be in equilibrium.     A   theory, then, which takes into account          only
one  of these equilibrated antagonists, must necessarily be defective.
And since, in all    cases, the attraction     supposed to exist between
two sets of particles must necessarily be resisted by actions between
them, there can be no tension like that which has been supposed to
be exhibited by the superficial films      of fluids.
2.  Theory of Construction of the Great Pyramid. By John
     Christie, Esq.       Communicated by the Rev. W. Lindsay
     Alexander, D.D.
   In his early investigations      on the principles      of construction of
the Great Pyramid, the author was forcibly struck with the follow
ing fact — viz., that if a perpendicular be drawn through the
apex of the Pyramid to its base, and the unit angle with the hori
zontal thrown up from the base on each side of this perpendicular,
the angle comes out on the faces of the Pyramid at the openings
of the north   and south ventilating      air-channels   ;  at the same time
 he was led to the conclusion that one-tenth          of the   base line, and
the same tenths also applied to the faces of the Pyramid, ruled the
entire structure.      Following this out, and having            erected   per
pendiculars   on   each   of these   tenths, and     horizontals     from each
of the facial    divisions,  the  first step procured a grand central
point — viz., in the centre of the grand gallery            ;  the    next step
 was to account for the position        of the King's Chamber, by the
intersections   of the first and      second    circles — used    in the con
struction of the Pyramid,      as shown in Diagram           No.   1.   Having
thus obtained a central perpendicular         for the King's Chamber, he
 then made use of the direction of the celestial equator, and where
it cut  the last-named perpendicular, a       third point     was gained as a
 centre for the third circle, which        completes the Pyramid in its
 external form.     He next found, that by connecting the south out
 crop of the air-channel       with the north corner of the base, a

                        of Edinburgh,,        Session 1869-70.                    163
 parallel was gained for the angle of the grand gallery.                    By draw
 ing a    horizontal line between the two air-channel                   mouths, and
 dropping perpendiculars            from these to the base, two oblongs are
formed,     one    on    each   side of the axis       ;  the diagonals of each of
these being the         unit angle.
   The astronomical           bearing of the Pyramid seems manifestly               to
be indicated       in the sections of the King's Chamber. In the sec
tion of it in its breadth, the chamber is filled up by — first, a section
of the Pyramid itself, the base of which is the floor line of the
chamber      ;  the    space   above, as regards height, being          filled by an
equilateral triangle, its angles 60°, corresponding                as they do with
the   direction        of the celestial       equator, 60° seem to point         with
threefold force to the fact that the Pyramid has a direct reference
to the sun.
   The same is twice               repeated in the section          of the King's
Chamber        in   its length, the length         of the chamber being exactly
twice   its breadth.         Another very marked reference of the               same
kind occurs in the position that the Queen's Chamber bears to the
King's Chamber.             If an   equilateral    triangle, whose apex is in the
centre    of the floor of the King's Chamber, be constructed, having
its base in the base line of the Pyramid, the centre of the floor
of the Queen's Chamber will be found to be exactly in the middle
of the north limb of this triangle, other instances are also shown
to be   regulated by the equilateral triangle.
   The unit angle regulates the length and height of the King's
Chamber, the space between it and the ante-chamber, the form of
the ante-chamber,          and the distance to the great step, also the in
terior    length, breadth, and depth of the much-abused                       granite
coffer.

                450 exactly      fill coffer.
   The shape of this block is regulated by the unit angle in its top
sides and face, and consequently conserves the Pyramid facial

164               Proceedings    of the Royal Society
angle, which it would not do had its length, breadth, or thickness
been different,   in which  case the complement      of these blocks would
have been too large or too small for the coffer content.
                Record of Physical Facts — Water-Levels.
   The King's Chamber       is a noted index    of these.     That this was
intended by the Pyramid builder           seems   to be demonstrated        by
the fact of the rock on which the Pyramid stands having                  been
scarped   down to the level of the Pyramid's base, so as to procure
a horizontal    line midway between        the external physical      fact to
be recorded, and the internal       index of that fact contained in the
King's Chamber, serving as it did, at the same time, astronomical
purposes, neither of which would have held good had the rock not
been so scarped     down.
   These water-levels      have been     previously   indicated     by other
modes than those by which        they are now illustrated.         It will   be
observed   that the circles used to indicate them have also peculiar
references to other parts of the Pyramid besides those they bear to
the  King's Chamber.       One marked instance may be noted here.
The circle, which indicates the High Nile-level, touches the floor
of the King's Chamber in the centre, and also indicates the angle
of the floor of the grand gallery.        Reference may also be made
here to one   of the circles  used in the construction    of the chambers
and passages,    it being of  a very marked and      significant character.
This circle   has its centre in the   Pyramid's  base,  in the point where
the "direction of the celestial equator" cuts the base, its radius is
the prime central point in the centre of the grand gallery,            and in
its course  it touches — 1st, The mouth of the entrance        passage   ;  2d,
The   step leading down to the Queen's Chamber;          3d,  The " bottom

the Low Nile-level     ; and 5th, Where      it cuts the lower portion of
the direction of the celestial equator, the High Nile-level.               The
difference between the mean Nile-level and the mean sea-level is
indicated    by an equilateral   triangle, the apex of which is in the
mean    sea-level, and the base the mean Nile-level, the length of
the latter being contained between two perpendiculars — the first
from the north corner of the Pyramid's base, the second from the
first remarkable perpendicular joint in the entrance passage.

     The paper consisted of a detailed account of the external form;
the arrangement of the body-cavity and its walls; the perivisceral
space    and corpuscles ; the digestive, circulatory,  and  generative
systems.
     It was specially  mentioned, in regard to the perivisceral     cor
puscles, that the author was not at all inclined to think that they
originated from the glandular     fatty coating of the digestive tract
and the dorsal blood-vessel.    The corpuscles seem rather to be the
product of the perivisceral   cavity itself and its special (free) con
tents.    This view requires no stretch of ordinary physiological
principles, and is quite in keeping     with what is found in other
groups.    In the Nemerteans, for instance,   a complex corpusculated
fluid is produced within a closed chamber with smooth walls.

 1.  Primitive Affinity between the Classical                 and   the Low
        German Languages.              By the Hon. Lord Neaves.
                                   (Abstract.)
    In this paper the author adverted to the limited attention that
was paid in this country to comparative philology, and noticed
the principles it had developed and the progress it had made else
where    of late years.
    In illustration of the results thus attained in the Aryan or Indo-
Germanic      languages, he took as familiar examples the affinities
that  could   be traced between the     Latin  and the Old   English tongues,
viewing the Latin as a type of the earlier branches of the family,
including the Greek and Indian ; and the English as a type of a
later branch, consisting chiefly of the Low German dialects.             The
affinities referred to were not those which           connected Latin with
English through the romance languages, but those which subsisted
between Latin and vernacular English, and which must have arisen
from a prehistoric identity or connection.
    The chief law regulating these affinities was what is commonly
called Grimm's law, but which is subject to various limitations and
exceptions.
    The affinities     between   words in cognate languages which have
had no     historic connection      are to be found out — 1st, by studying
the general     law of letter-change      prevailing   between   the primary
and secondary branches         of the family ; and 2d, by finding out the
peculiarities or idiosyncrasies of the individual languages sought
to be  compared     ;  for each language has    a  character of its own, and

108                Proceedings    of the Royal Society
both    Latiu and English      have  strong peculiarities  distinguishing
them from other languages, which help to conceal cognate words
from each other, and which must be mastered before the double
disguise can be seen through.
    He exemplified    these views by detailed instances, and concluded
by urging that all nations of the Aryan race ought to be regarded
as susceptible of the highest culture, and that the good hopes
might be entertained of their being all raised to as elevated a        stat<-
of Christian civilisation as the best of them had attained.

    In this communication an attempt was           made    to  express by
 means of formulae the various modifications        presented   by the   life
 series   of the Hydroida.       It was also shown that there       existed
 among the Eydroida both centripetal and centrifugal forms of
 development. These were compared with one another, and numer
 ous analogies between     the hydroid gonosome     and the inflorescence

                                  {Abstract.)
    In this   paper an attempt is made to supply, at least in part, what
 the   author   has long   felt as  a  want in the beautiful     system of
 quaternions, so far as it has yet been developed.          To apply it to
 general inquiries     connected with electricity, fluid motion, &c., we
 require to have      means of comparing quaternion-integrals         taken
 over a closed    surface with others extended through the enclosed
 space — and of comparing integrals taken      over a non-closed surface
 with    others  extended round its boundary.        The author recently
 found that he had already, in the Quarterly Math. Journal, and in
 the Proc. R. S. E., furnished the means of attacking the problem.
     By very simple considerations it is established that

     Some sections           are devoted to the representation of

representation          is   possible      is   obvious from the fundamental theorem
above, which shows that for                     a   closed surface

and therefore the surface-integral  must have the same value (with
a    mere change of sign depending on the difference between outside
and inside) for the two parts into which the surface                                       is   divided by
any closed curve drawn upon it.
     Other theorems of          a   similar character are given, such as

4. Proposed             Method      of ascertaining             the Temperature         of
      Falling Eain.            By Thomas           Stevenson,        F.R.S.E.,       Civil
     Engineer.
     A    friend informed me some time ago that the late Principal                        J.
D.       Forbes   had     often noticed        that a long         continuance     of rain
resulted in a track of cold weather.                    Principal Forbes attributed
this fact to      the    rain having a lower temperature than the atmo
sphere through which it fell.                 It does   not appear, however, that he
made any observations to determine the truth of his hypothesis, and
as the subject is        of considerable importance in other meteorological
questions, it occurred             to me      that a simple instrument could be
made       for ascertaining the temperature of falling rain.                      This in
strument, a rough model of the funnel                    of which was lately shown
at    a    meeting      of   the   Scottish     Meteorological       Society, is repre
sented      in    the    accompanying          diagram,    in    which    A B C         is a
conical      funnel      of thin glass,        terminating       in a small tube deep
                                   enough     to contain     the    bulb of a thermo
                                   meter, and recurved so as to form             an off-let
                                   or waster.         ADDA           represents     a   box
                                   of wood     into     which    the glass funnel         is
                                   inserted, the space between           the glass and
                                   the wood      being carefully       filled with      saw
                                   dust or any other bad            conductor of heat.
                                   The rim of the funnel should be bent over
                                   the upper edges of the box, so as to prevent
                                   the possibility of rain lodging itself among
the sawdust.*            The rain-drops intercepted by the funnel will                  pass
off through the bottom of the box by the tube C.
   By this or some such simple arrangement the temperature of any
heavy fall of rain may be ascertained with tolerable accuracy.                            It
is,   of   course, necessary       that   a   dry bulb thermometer, properly pro
tected by a louvre boarded             box, should be observed           simultaneously
with the rain thermometer.
      The difference of temperature between                  the air and rain could

through the side of the box instead of downwards.

Leslie's differential thermometer, one bulb of which would be placed
at the   bottom of the glass funnel, while the other would be pro
tected from the      rain.   In   this way the differences of temperature
would be     constantly shown by means of a single instrument.

                 Diagrams of Forces in Framework.
             To  the  Secretary of the Royal Society, Edinburgh.
    Sir, — As Mr Clerk Maxwell, in          a paper lately published in the
Transactions of this Society, has          done   me the honour to refer to
me as    having   been the first to show how to combine in one diagram
a  system of lines representing the directions         and magnitudes    of all
the forces acting in a given frame,          I wish  to put on record, in the
Proceedings      of the Society,    the time and manner of my first publi
cation of the method in question.             It was in the year 1856, in a
lithographed      synopsis of lectures which      I delivered  in the Univer
sity    of Glasgow,      entitled     " Mechanical     Laws,  Formulae,    and
Tables."       Copies of that synopsis     were distributed   to the students
of my class, and to a few men of science.
    I beg leave herewith       to send for presentation to the Society a
 copy of the first part of that synopsis, and regret that at present          I
 am   unable    to   make up     a  complete copy.      The construction     of
 diagrams of forces for unbraced frames is shown at p.              7, and  for
 braced frames at p. 8.
    The next publication of the method took place in 1857, in the

 172                Proceedings of      the   Royal Society
article " Mechanics Applied, " of the " Encyclopiedia Britannica,"
eighth edition     ; and the next again in 1858, in a work of mine
entitled   "  A Manual of Applied Mechanics."
    Mr Clerk Maxwell made a material improvement in the mode of
 applying the method to braced frames, which he published in the
 "                               "
   Philosophical      Magazine      for 1866, and described to the Dundee
meeting of the British Association.         —I    am, Sir, your most obedient
servant,                                        W.   J. Macquorn    Rankink.

1.   On Spectra formed             by Doubly Refracting Crystals             in
   Polarised Light.         By Francis Deas, Esq., LL.B., F.R.S.E.
    The instrument used in the experiments forming the subject of
this paper was a spectrum microscope,           to which a polarising appara
tus is attached, consisting       of two Nicol's prisms,       each of which is
capable of being turned through any required number of degrees.
    The first part of the paper relates to the spectra obtained when
one or more thin films of mica or selenite are interposed between
the polariser     and   the   dispersion    prisms, the light being subse
quently analysed.
    The method employed          was, having     first determined the axes of
the films, to place them on the stage of the instrument                which is
rotatory, and      to  adjust them at various angles to the plane of
polarisation.
    The general appearance        presented,    may be described as being      a
more or less continuous spectrum, interrupted by one or more well-
defined black bands, not unlike         the ordinary absorption bands pro
duced by many chemical substances.
    The bands have in many cases            a  curious movement along the
length of    the   spectrum as the analyser is turned.             Sometimes a
band may be observed to split into two halves, which move in op
posite directions, and unite with other bands which advance to
meet them.
    In all cases a set   of complementary       bands    is obtained when the
plane of analysation has been turned through 00° to that              of polar

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1869-70.                      173
isation.      The positions and relative movements of the bands de
pend     partly on the thickness of the films, partly on the inclination
of their axes to one another, and to the planes of polarisation             as
detailed in the paper.
    Curious     varieties of the movements       are obtained  by circularly
polarising the      light before or after its  passage  through the film.
    Very beautiful results      were   further   obtained by substituting     a
double image prism         as the analyser.     When the spectra thus      ob
tained are superposed, the bands are no longer black, but coloured,
each band       in the  one spectrum being     of the colour of that part of
the other spectrum        on which   it  is superposed, while   the adjacent
colours     are those arising from the blending of the two spectra.
     To obtain these effects in perfection, however, certain adjust
 ments of the apparatus must be attended to, which will be found
 described     in the paper.
     The second part of the paper relates to the effects obtained
 when a section of a doubly refracting crystal, cut perpendicular to
 its axis, so as to give the well-known systems of coloured rings, is
 substituted      for the mica or selenite in the former experiments.
     The crystal must in this     case be placed, not upon the stage, but
 immediately        over the eye lens of the instrument, and between it
 and the analyser.        The entire length of the spectrum is now seen
 intersected by a system of black arcs, accompanied by two or more
 brushes, which are black or coloured according to the position of
 the analyser.
      Interesting effects are produced upon the rings by interposing
  films of mica of different thicknesses, so as to polarise the light
  either circularly or elliptically    ; the mode in which     the black and
  coloured rings alternate and change places during the revolution of
  the analyser depending on the thickness of the film used.
       The effect of the rings, when viewed through a double image
   prism, is strikingly beautiful.     Exquisite patterns resembling tessa-
   lated pavement, chain armour, &c., may thus, with a little inge
   nuity in the mode of arrangement,         be produced by the interlacing
   systems of rings.

 2. On the      Heat Disengaged in the Combination of Acids
    and Bases.      Second Memoir.         By Thomas Andrews, M.D..
     F.E.S., Hon. F.R.S.E.
                                 (Abstract.)
    In  the beginning of this paper the author recapitulates the five
 fundamental     laws of the heat of combination, which he had de
 duced from his previous researches,        and which form the subject    of
 several memoirs published in the Transactions of the Royal Irish
 Academy and of the Royal Society of London, from 1841 to 1848.
 They are as follows : —
    Law 1. — The heat disengaged in the union of acids and          bases  is
 determined by the base, and not by the acid          ; the same base pro
 ducing, when combined with an equivalent of different acids, nearly
 the same quantity of heat    ; but different bases, different quantities.
    Law 2. — When     a neutral is converted into an acid salt by com-
 hining with one or more atoms of acid, no change of temperature
 occurs.
    Law   3. — When a neutral is converted into a basic salt by com
bining with     an additional   proportion    of base, the combination    is
 accompanied with the evolution of heat.
    Law   4. — When    one  base    displaces another from     any of its
 neutral combinations, the heat evolved or abstracted is always the
 same, whatever the acid element may be, provided the bases are the
 same.
    Law  5. — When an equivalent        of one   and the same metal re
 places  another in a solution of any of its salts of the same order,
 the heat disengaged is always the same, but a change in either of
the metals produces a different disengagement of heat.
    The concluding part of the     elaborate  memoir of    MM. Favre and
Silbermann, on the heat disengaged in chemical actions, which ap
peared   a few years later, is chiefly devoted      to a repetition of the
experiments already published by the author.              They  state  that
they consider the fourth law, which asserts the equality of thermal
effect in basic substitutions, to be fully established ; but they
dissent from what they consider to be the enunciation of the first
law, and infer from their own experiments that the organic acids —

                        of Edinburgh,         Session 1869-70.                     175
  oxalic, acetic, &c. — disengage sensibly less heat in combining with
  the bases      than the nitric, hydrochloric,       and other mineral         acids.
 In his first memoir (published in 1841)                the   author of this com
 munication         had,   on the contrary, found that the oxalic           acid dis
engages       quite as much heat as the nitric and hydrochloric acids,
 when      it combines with the bases, and this property of oxalic acid
he always         regarded as the key to his whole investigations              on this
subject.        He therefore considered it important to institute               a new
set   of experiments in order to settle the question. These experi
ments, which were performed with great care, and with accurate
instruments,         are fully described in the present communication.
The results confirm the general accuracy of his original experi
ments of 1841.            They show that oxalic acid, far from disengaging
sensibly less heat than the hydrochloric                and nitric acids in com
bining with the           bases, actually disengages a      little more heat than
either       of those acids, when it combines with potash,                   soda, or
ammonia.           The following extract from a table given in the                pre
sent    communication will illustrate this point : —
            Acid.                         Potash.        Soda.          Ammonia.

        Hydrochloric,           .         3°021         2°-982           2° 623

    The original experiments of the author, according to which
 oxalic acid stands, as regards thermal action, in the same rank as
 the phosphoric, nitric, arsenic, hydrochloric,           hydriodic, boracic, and
other mineral acids (with the exception of the sulphuric acid), are
 thus completely confirmed.              The new experiments also agree with
 the former        ones in showing       that sulphuric   acid disengages about
 yth more heat, and a group of acids comprising                  the tartaric, citric,
 and    succinic acids, about j^th less heat than the mean of the other
 acids.      The results     are  fully discussed in the present memoir,          and
 the   influence of extraneous circumstances considered, which in this,

3. Note on Professor Bain's                  Theory of Euclid 1. 4. By Wm.
    Robertson          Smith,      M.A., Assistant to the Professor of
    Natural Philosophy.                 Communicated by Professor                 Tait.
    In  a paper communicated to this Society last session,                     I pointed
out that the proof of Euc.               I.  5, given by        Mr Mill, is unsound       ;
endeavouring,          at the same time, to show that this is no mere
accident, but that it is impossible to give                  a  mathematically correct
analysis of the processes              of Synthetic        Geometry on any theory
that holds figures to be merely illustrative,                     and does not admit
that intuition in the Kantian sense — i.e.,                 actual looking at a    single
engraved or imaginary figure — may                    be a necessary       and sufficient
step in     a  demonstration perfectly general.                 I now venture    to  draw
the attention of the Society to the confirmation which                        I conceive
 that this argument derives from the way in which Euc.                            I.  4 is
treated     by    Professor Bain in his recent "Logic" — a book which,
on the whole, is based on             Mr Mill's principles,        and which is   mainly
original      in an attempt, which              I   cannot regard as felicitous,        to
bring     these     principles into closer contact with the special sciences,
 especially with Physics and Mathematics.
     It will   be remembered          that Mr    Mill, undertaking       to demonstrate
 Euc. I. 5      from first principles, has to supply, in the course of his
 proof,   a  demonstration of Euc.           I.  4, and   it  is in the attempt to give
 to   this process        the   form of syllogistic          inference    from Euclid's
 axioms that he errs.              Professor Bain does not attempt to defend
 the blunder of his predecessor.                   He admits that Euclid's proof
 cannot      be   reduced to a chain of syllogisms.                 But, instead of sur
 rendering       Mr Mill's theory of mathematical reasoning, he concludes
  that Euclid has not demonstrated his proposition — that the super
  position which he enjoins is only an experiment, and that
                                                                                  " if his
  readers     had    not made actual experiments of the kind indicated,
  they could not         be   convinced by the reasoning in the demonstra
  tion."*
      Now    I   believe,   and   in my former paper             expressly pointed out,
  that the position that Euc.             I.  4 is really an inductive         truth, and
  that the usual demonstration is not in itself convincing, is the only

ground that remains to Mr Mill and his adherents. So far, then, I
am confirmed by Professor Bain : it remains only to show that this
new position            is mathematically            as untenable as that from which
Mr Mill          has been dislodged.                If    Professor Bain grants that the
 proof of Euc.            I.    4 is not by syllogism                 from axioms —       if,   again,
 mathematically            it   is   plain that there           is   none the less   a   real proof,
 not merely an            induction — we shall have gone far to establish                          the
 validity of proof by intuition.
   Professor Bain tells us that Euclid, while                                   professedly going
 through        a    process     of pure deduction, requires                   us to conceive an
 experimental           proof.       There    is   surely an ambiguity here.               Does Mr
 Bain      mean       that Euclid merely calls to our mind former concrete
 experiments            with triangles of card-board or paper, for these alone
 are actual and concrete to our author?                                Does Euclid's "experi
           "              with the descriptions of experiments in books of
 ment           agree
 Physics,        save     only in this, that we have all made Euclid's experi
 ment       before    ?      Clearly    not.       In picturing to myself                an experi
 mental         proof in the usual sense,            I      imagine mentally, or with the
 help of        a    diagram, certain arrangements, and then                       I     am told to
 imagine         a   certain result following—or rather,                  I     am told to believe
 this result, for          to picture    it   is   quite superflous and often impossible.
 Euclid,        on    the other hand, tells me to superpose ideally the point
 A    on    C,   the line      ABon CD, and          so forth, and then          I   do not require
 to   be told that the coincidence                       of the whole triangles follows.              I
  have no choice to imagine coincidence or non-coincidence.                                     I     see
 that      it   follows, and that quite apart from previous experiment.
      Professor         Bain     allows the possibility           of ideal experiments on
  mathematical            forms.*     I   presume,         therefore, that he will not deny
  that the intelligent               of our proposition does, as he reads,
                                     reader
  make      a    valid experiment in favour of the proposition. But   this                      if
  be so, where            is   the deception in Euclid's proof, and what                         is   the
  necessity          of supplementing that proof by further                              " ideal " or
  "actual experiments"?             The course of Euclid's argument                              shows
  that the two triangles are not only equal, but equal in virtue of the
  way in        which they have          been constructed, viz., the equality of the
  two sides and the included angle.                          The fact that the proof             is   not
 syllogistic          does      not make      it    any the less          a   case of that parity of
                                        •

178                   Proceedings       of the Royal Society
reasoning which Professor              Bain, in another connection, admits to
be not induction        but demonstration.*
   Our author draws a broad line between                   the fourth proposition,
with its "appeal to experiment                 or trial in the concrete," and the
mass    of geometrical proofs in which the figure is referred to for
verification only, " the effect of every construction and                 every step
of reasoning being judged of by actual inspection."                   But  if the   in
spection follows the construction, what is the construction itself?
A construction is not proved by syllogism from axioms.                           It   is
necessarily drawn, and in the drawing (mental or other) looked at.
Every construction involves a figure and an intuition, which, while
it looks at     the  individual figure,     sees in   it the general truth.f        Mr
Bain grants that of such consequences                   as that the diagonal      of   a
parallelogram divides it into two triangles, Euclid offers no other
proof than an appeal to the eye.              J   In fact, no other proof can        be
offered.     Yet surely it will not             be asserted    that this too is an
induction.        In   one word,     if no proposition      is fairly demonstrated
where it is essential to look at the figure, there is no sound de
monstration in synthetic geometry.
   Finally, Professor Bain himself seems not quite satisfied as to
tho inductive nature of Euc. I. 4. " The proof," he says, " rests
solely on definitions," and hence " the proposition cannot be real —
the subject and predicate must be identical."                   Surely an identical
proposition      is not an induction        !    And surely,    too, the proof rests
not on definitions        merely, but on definitions           and the use of the
figure  !    But   I do   not think that Professor Bain means               to speak
hero   in strict logical        terms, for he straightway adds in explana
       "   The
tion,             proposition must, in fact, be a mere equivalent of the
notions of line, angle, surface, equality —a fact apparent in the
operation of understanding these notions.                  It  is implicated   in the
experience requisite           for mastering       the indefinable     elements      of
geometry, and should be rested purely on the basis of experience."
We should have known better what this sentence                        means,   if  the
author had adopted            here   the distinction      between    synthetic    and
analytic judgments.             He cannot      mean    that a truth that is an in-

duction, and rests on experience, is an analytic judgment, that it
can be reached           by a purely formal dividing and compounding of
the definitions of terms.            Such a proposition could be shown to be
true without        any figure or any experiment.               Yet the proposition
 is,   we are told,      involved in the notions;          we     cannot know        what
 lines, angles, &c., are without knowing this too. If this means
 anything, it means that Euc. I. 4 is a synthetic judgment a priori ;
 and that, after all, Kant and the mathematicians are right, and Mr
 Mill    and the empirical logicians wrong.
 4.     A   Simple Mode of Approximating to the Wave-Length
       of Light By W. Leitch, Assistant to the Professor of
       Natural Philosophy in the University of Glasgow. Com
       municated by Professor Tait.
    The fundamental phenomenon or fact of the science of optics is
 vision, that    the perception we have of distant objects through
                   is,
 the eye, or by the sense of sight.  That vision   an effect trans is
 mitted to the mind by the object seen,             is
                                                    a     necessary        truth, involved
 in the definition        of the term, and independent of all theoretical
 views beyond the consciousness of that perception.
       Common observation informs us that vision cannot take place
 without     that which we call light, and that light itself cannot exist
 without      the presence     of   a    self-luminous    body.      Every one has       a
 distinct conception of the meaning of the terms                  light and luminous;
 their definition according             to that   conception would be            a   verbal
 exercise of no utility at present.
       Next may     be placed the fact, first revealed            by astronomical ob
 servations, and afterwards verified by other experiments, that light                    is
  not transmitted instantaneously,           — in other   words, that some portion
  of time     elapses     between    the occurrence of      a     visible phenomenon
  and our perception of         it      by the eye, such    as,    for simplicity,      the
  passage    of   an electric spark, or the occultation           of   a   star by the dark
  body of the moon or of            a   planet;   and that the portion of time in
  question    is   in direct proportion to the distance of                 the object seen
 from the eye, the intervening medium being the same.
       The progressive motion of light from the object                     seen to the eye
 being established, and the supposition that              it   is
                                                               a       substance emanat

ing from the object with the velocity found, being seen to be                   in
consistent with the phenomena of interference,              we can     scarcely be
said to make use of a hypothesis when we conclude that it is an
action transmitted through a medium bodily at rest, it may be,                 but
whose component molecules act upon one another in                  s^ich a  way as
to propagate the effect      in question.      By  the term      light   we  mean
this action considered as a physical fact, separate            from our percep
tion of it by the eye, and independent of its arrival or non-arrival
at our organs of vision.
    The propagation of light from         a luminous     point with the same
velocity in all directions (in a homogeneous medium), implies                 that
the action originating at any instant in the source is diffused               over
a spherical surface whose radius, measured          from the luminous point
as centre,    constantly increases    at the rate  of the velocity of light ;
and the eonstnncy with which this propagation is kept up, implies
that there are an infinite       number of such spherical surfaces, over
each of which is diffused an action which originated in the source               at
a preceding instant.       Next the question      presents     itself whether   all
these   actions originating     in the source at successive          instants, and
occupying successive spherical surfaces, are similar and equivalent.
 The phenomena of interference answer, that            if  we imagine a      series
of these spherical surfaces separated from             each other by a        very
 small constant distance     X,  the action propagated       upon each of these
 surfaces   is the tame, and that midway between               each pair    of the
 series is a surface propagating an action capable           of destroying that
of its neighbour of the first     series, from which     it is  separated by   tbe
constant distance     ^
                        .  Now, that is equivalent to saying that each
 thin spherical shell of the medium through which the action                      is
 transmitted,    vibrates between      opposite   phases,     and    as  it is im
 possible for us to conceive or believe that any finite change can
 take place in the material world that does not involve an infinite
 number of intermediate infinitesimal         changes,    we are    authorised to
 say that  light consists in periodic vibrations,       propagated       with very
 great velocity, and decomposable           in an infinite      number of ways
 into half vibrations exactly contrary to one another.
    Thus far    we have arrived without       having recourse        to any hypo
 thesis, having assumed         nothing    regarding    the     uature    of these

                     of Edinburgh,        Session 1869-70.                     181
 vibrations,   the word vibration being understood in its most general
sense as    meaning oscillation      between opposite phases or conditions,
a fact   revealed    to us by the phenomena of interference.             Even at
this point, however, the hypothesis            which   forms the basis of the
uudulatory theory cannot fail to present itself to our minds, the
hypothetical part being not so much the existence of a medium, or
the propagation        of vibrations, but     the nature attributed     to these
vibrations,     viz., that they consist in       mere   mechanical action, in
volving nothing but variations of pressure and displacement among
the particles      of which the medium is          composed,   and   propagated
according     to the same laws as in ponderable media with which we
are    more   familiar.     The   suspension of interfering       vibrations     is
interpreted    in the simplest manner as the result of the simultaneous
application of equal and opposite forces, or according to a fiction
easily understood, the superposition of equal and opposite motions,
and their reappearance after separation as the natural             consequence
of the    indestructibility of force.         Moreover, our experience does
not enable us to conceive any other kind of vibrations decomposable
in the same manner, though the phenomenon of electrolysis seems
to  indicate the propagation of       a  periodic oscillation between opposite
phases     of decomposition      and    recomposition,    involving something
more than        variations    of pressure     and  displacement     among the
particles    of water.     Even the small degree of uncertainty that may
remain     at this stage of the inquiry, is diminished           by the pheno
menon      of diffraction,  and by the physiological       analogy between the
eye and the ear, both of them situated like feelers of the brain             ;  we
know the        variety of perceptions that are communicated              to the
mind by the effect of mechanical               vibrations   upon one of these
organs.
     Adopting the hypothesis,        we call these     vibrations  waves,   from
their analogy to the vibrations so designated in the case of water,
 and the distance       \ above   mentioned we call the length of a wave
 of  light. In order to     effect its measurement, we produce the pheno
 menon of interference       ; that is done most directly by deflecting two
 pencils    of light proceeding from the          same source   in  such  a way
 that they may be superposed           after traversing paths differing by
                                                                                 ^,

phenomenon of diffraction, which                        is usually accompanied by that
of interference.
     Diffraction       is the name given to the lateral deviation of light                                   in
passing the edge of an obstacle, i.e., of an opaque                               body.           Having
adopted the undulatory                    theory, we are ready to admit that such a
deviation ought to take place, both from our experience of similar
effects     in air and water, and from our general ideas of the structure
and equilibrium                 of fluids, from which we conclude that no single
particle of a fluid can be disturbed without                           disturbing            those sur
rounding it on all sides, that                   is,   propagating      a   disturbance in          all
directions.        When light, proceeding from                        a   luminous           source of
very small apparent diameter, passes the edge of                              a    dark body and
is   received upon          a    screen, instead       of   a   sudden transition from                  light
to darkness at the        line where the geometrical shadow commences,
we observe       a   gradually diminishing illumination for some distance
inside  of that line, and outside of    we observe maxima andit
minima of illumination arranged in bands parallel to                                       it, if      it   is   a
straight line.  In order to effect the measurement of the length
X,   and understand the principle of the process,                           it   is   not necessary
to follow the mathematical                     investigation       of the position and in
tensity of these maxima and minima.                             That investigation   based       is
upon the axiom that each point of                           a   wave of   light       is   a     centre of
force, the molecule there situated tending to propagate the energy
with which        it       is   animated in all directions around                 it,   so that,        if   it
were       at any instant the only molecule agitated,                            it   would imme
diately become the actual centre of spherical wave.  In the case
                                                         a

envelope of all these elementary undulations to which     trans
mitted the vibratory movement of each molecule, and which, by
reason      of symmetry,             is   a   spherical surface concentric                   with that
which      it   succeeds.          Diffraction takes place when part of the wave
is   intercepted           by an      obstacle, and
                                              symmetry       the                        is

which       kept the surface of the wave concentric with its first posi
tion.       The propagation of a spherical wave does not require that
contiguous         molecules          be      allowed free play.            If    we         look at             a
luminous        source          through    a   fine grating,         we see   it      in the same

position      as    if   the grating were removed, which proves that a con
centric spherical            wave is formed by the union of the fragmentary
parts   of the incident            wave which the grating             has allowed to pass,
or at least         the fragmentary            parts distributed       over the spherical
surface produce             the same effect upon our sense of vision as                      if   the
surface were occupied               by an unbroken wave.                   If   the grating        be
sufficiently fine, and the luminous                   source not too near, we see not
only the source              in its proper position, but            also images of           it    on
both sides          in the direction at right angles                to the       wires or dark
lines of the grating.               If
                          the light of the source be homogeneous,
that    the same as we find at any point of
        is,                                   pure spectrum, these
                                                                a
lateral images are counterparts of the true image, of various in
tensities.          If    the source emit white light,          it    is   exhibited       in each
of these images separated                  into its component colours, the image
being spread out so as to form                 a   spectrum, with the violet extremity
nearest to         the central image.
     In order to understand the origin of                     these    lateral images, first
suppose        the transparent intervals              to be   of infinitely small width,
and separated by dark spaces of finite and equal breadth.                                  Suppose
light coming from              a   distant source to be incident upon them in                       a
direction perpendicular to their plane.                       The   space occupied by the
system        of lines and         spaces    being very small, the surface of an
incident wave may be considered as coinciding                               with their plane,
so    that a similar           phase     of vibration     passes      at all        points of the
transparent              lines at the same instant.           Each of these lines thus
becomes            the axis of     a     system of cylindrical             waves      behind      the
grating, and at any instant the same phase of vibration                               is   found in
each system at the same distance from the axis.
     Suppose the dark lines in the figure to represent sections of
these      cylindrical        surfaces    in the     same phase of vibration.                 Upon
the surfaces which envelope                a   succession of these surfaces of similar
 phase,       in   a   direction   parallel to AB, are formed              a    system of waves
 by   which we see the true image in its real position                          ;   similarly,     by
a    system        of    waves which      envelope surfaces of similar phase, in                    a
direction parallel to CD, we see the first lateral image to the right                               ;
        system of waves parallel to EC, we see the second image, and
 by
 a
so    on.      If
              we denote by a the distance between the transparent
lines, and by D, the angular deviation of the first lateral image,

   184             Proceedings of       the  Royal Society
  we find, from the position of the surface CD, a sin               D  as the     dis
  tance between successive       surfaces of similar phase parallel to           CD,
  that is to say, as the length of the wave of the light propagated
  in the direction normal to CD. Similarly, by drawing perpen
 diculars  upon the successive envelope surfaces                through     C from
 the first opening to the right, we get for the same wave length
 - a sin Di from the      second image, „ a sin D2 from the third, and so
 u                                          O
 on.   In the   case  of white light, the separation into its component
 colours exhibited      in each lateral image enables           us, by observing
 the deviation of each colour of the spectrum, to measure the wave
 length of light of that colour.
    The lateral images      are thus easily accounted for in the imaginary
 case,  in which     the transparent      intervals     are of    infinitely small
 breadth.     Gratings have been constructed by ruling sensibly dark
 lines upon glass so closely that the             breadth of the transparent
 interval  is  only    a small    fraction    of the length of        wave.      The
 explanation of the images seen through these                is the same as that
                                   just given       for   the    imaginary      case.
                                   Suppose,      however, the width          of the
                                   spaces to be so much greater than              the
                                   length of wave, that the small inclined

fractional          part of the         wave    length     will not            be destroyed by the
concurrence of its complete opposite, and light will be propagated
along AP.   The other transparent spaces will send concordant
phases to the envelope wave, if AP be at the proper angle.      In
this case, however,              the breadth t of a transparent space must be
added     to a       in the formula            a sin D, &c., a + t being the distance

effective       in forming any            one of these            envelope waves, be either               a
very    small        or a very large fraction,                its   effect      will    be feeble,    and
the corresponding               image of small intensity                  ;   but   if it   be exactly
one-half of the wave length, its effect                       will   be the greatest possible,
and the envelope wave will receive from each opening the greatest
possible amount of concordant action.  In this manner is explained
the difference         of intensity of           these    lateral images, the one nearest
to   the central        image not being always the brightest.                               Proximity
to   the central image            is,   however, also         a   cause       of greater brightness,
it   being evident that the less the surface AC in the last figure                                        is
inclined to the incident waves, the greater                           is       the absolute length
of that part          of   it   which stretches over any given fraction of the
wave    length, and the greater the amount of action of which                                        it   is
the locus.
     In the     above       the incident waves have been supposed                             to be ex
actly parallel   to the plane of the grating, so that the same phase
of   vibration passes at the same instant through all the openings.

 stant, though derived from different incident waves, and the first
 lateral image will be seen in a direction             normal to the grating.
 The    same formula    will give the    wave length in this case,         D being
 always the angular deviation         from the true image or from the
 direction    of the incident   light.     This   is the      condition    approxi
 mately realised in the arrangements for measuring the                wave   length
 about to be described,     but as no provision is made for an exact
 adjustment of the grating        to the inclination just indicated,             and
as a very minute error in such an adjustment                    would cause      the
conditions of the experiment to be altogether different from those
 indicated by the figure above,        it is   necessary      to account for the
appearance      of lateral images in the       case  of light incident       at any
angle, and find a formula for the wave length applicable to that case.
    If,  as in the figure below, the incident waves be so inclined to
the grating that the perpendicular BC, together with the perpen
                                              dicular BD, make up the wave
                                             length, the same phase of vi

                                             openings, like phases          will  be
                                             situated upon surfaces inclined
at the same angle as AD, that is to say,                 AD produced will        en
velope like phases, and the first lateral image will be seen in the
direction normal to AD.        If we   denote by     I   the angle    of incidence

Different measurements            may be got by the same observer at dif
ferent times from his uncertainty as to the points in the spectrum
at which he should consider each             colour to begin and end.     This
 uncertainty        is usually  considered to be obviated by using        solar
 light, and measuring         the deviations   of the dark lines in the spec
 trum    ;  but as these lines are    the parts of the spectrum from which
 no   light comes, the process can scarcely          be called the determina
 tion of the wave length of light.
     Since the above measurements were made, an improvement was
 made in the apparatus by which the gratings were constructed, and
 finer gratings were          made,  which gave more     brilliant spectra,  by
  reason      of  the  greater number      of apertures from which similar
 phases of vibration came to the eye.            With one of these, consisting
 of transparent spaces drawn at the rate of 3000 to the inch, a new
 set of measurements was taken in the following manner              : —
     EF     represents a rectangular piece of
  wood upon which          is pinned  a  piece of
  paste- board       ABCD,    whose  edge   AFB
 is an arc of radius 20 inches and
 centre at E. The chord AB is divided
  into tenths of an inch by perpendicu
  lars to it meeting the arc.         Touching
  the arc are placed, but not fixed, two
  pieces of tin bent       as represented at G,
 each having         a narrow slit so situated
 that the bottom of the one slit is on a
  level with       the top of the other, and
 carrying       a small piece    of candle im
 mediately behind the slit.           The grat
 ing is held at E, and the pieces of tin
 are moved along the arc until the
 colour observed        in each spectrum is in
  the same vertical line at       F.    The dis
  tance between         the two slits is then
  read     upon the graduated chord, and
                                                                 b
  the   half of that distance divided by
  20  inches is the sine of the deviation.           In this  case the second
 spectrum        from    each light was observed,      ard the   observed   dis-

   The apparatus contrived and constructed by the author                      to pro
duce these fine gratings           has not been described, because its con
struction      involves     considerable     trouble    and expense, which the
experimenter may avoid by applying to an instrument-maker                        who
has a    dividing machine.           The difficulty of getting a sufficiently
fine dark ground upon the glass will also be avoided if the dividing
machine be fitted with a diamond point, which will scratch com
paratively       opaque    lines on the transparent            surface of the glass.
The finest gratings constructed             are produced in that way.

6.  On the      Oxidation Products of Picoline.                        By James
   Dewar,      T.R.S.E., Lecturer on Chemistry,                        Veterinary
    College, Edinburgh.
                                   (Abstract.)
   The author in this paper details the results of a series of experi
ments, commenced three              years    ago,   on   the    oxidation    of   the
pyridine    series of bases.         These bodies are readily attacked             by
permanganate of potash         ;   and the oxidation       products of picoline
thus obtained are ammonia,              carbonic, nitric, oxalic,       acetic, and
dicarbopyridenic       acids, along with a very small quantity of some
solid base, possibly a condensed           base.
    Dicarbopyridenic      acid, C5HaN       qqjj> is bibasic, and         bears   the
same relation     to the nucleus pyridine           that phthalic      acid and its
isomers bear to benzol.          It  crystallises from hot aqueous         solutions
in plates resembling naphthaline; the majority of its salts are
soluble and crystallisable.            The silver salt of the acid is very
characteristic,   being insoluble        and gelatinous, not decomposed            by
boiling water, and not visibly affected by light. As this acid was
got in only small quantity, the author had not the opportunity
of producing its various derivatives.
   The author observes        that the two well-defined           series  of nitrile
bases found in coal tar, viz., the pyridine                and chinoline       series,
bear   the same     relation      to   each    other   that    the benzol       series
of hydrocarbons      does to the naphthaline.            Thus, pyridine       is sup
posed    to  be the     nucleus     in these     bodies that benzol       is in the
 aromatic series.       The following       are some   of the analogies pointed
 out in the paper —  :

 this   direction.      It  is observed        also that indol,         the     nucleus    of
 indigo, is   benzol-pyrrol, being related thus,

It   is therefore   likely that indol may be met with along with pyrrol
among     the products of the destructive distillation of nitrogenised
organic substances.           While this paper         is passing through the press,
Professor Baeyer of Berlin has pointed out, independently,                          a simi
lar relation between pyrrol and indol,                a  note of which has just been

7.    Notes of some Experiments on the Eate of Flow of Blood
     and some other Liquids through tubes of narrow diameter.
     By    J.   Matthews Duncan, M.D., F.R.S.E, and Arthur
     Gamgee, M.D.,           F.R.S.E.
     The experiments,        of which      the results are recorded in the present
 communication,         were undertaken          in order to determine the           rate at
 which blood flows through tubes of moderately small diameter, with a
view to the study of the mechanical theory of dysmenorrhoea; they
were afterwards extended to blood-clot, serum,                     milk, and urine, &c.
     In  a memoir inserted in the            ninth   volume      of the " Memoires des
savants etrangers," M. Poiseuille stated the results of an investiga
 tion on the flow of water and other fluids through capillary tubes,
showing       how this is influenced            by pressure, by          the length      and
 diameter of the tube,           and by temperature.              A    committee of the
 French Academy, of which M. Regnault was the reporter, corrobo
 rated the results       of M. Poiseuille's researches.*               Subsequently this
 observer     published a still more extended series of observations, in
 cluding the determination              of the     rate   of flow of      serum and defi-
  brinated blood. t

194                   Proceedings      of the Royal Society
    The method employed by Poiseuille in his               researches,  and which
is described at length            in   his  Memoir,    consisted essentially     in
causing air under a known pressure to force a known quantity of
the fluid to be experimented upon through tubes of known diameter
and length, and determining             the time employed.
    The following        are the general results to which he arrived con
cerning the influence of the length and diameter of tubes of smaller
diameter than a millimetre on the rate of flow of any liquid at a
constant pressure and temperature              : —
    1st.   The volumes of liquid flowing in equal times through capil
lary tubes of equal length, but of different diameters, are amongst
themselves as the fourth powers of the diameters.
    2d. The volumes of liquids which flow in equal times through
capillary tubes of the same diameter, but of different lengths, vary
inversely as the length of the tubes.
    With regard to the influence of pressure, it was found that the
 rate of flow increased directly as the pressure ; and with regard to
 the temperature, that, as a general rule, the rate of flow of solutions
 increases     as the temperature rises.
    With regard to the influence of various substances held in solu
 tion by a fluid, on the rate of flow, no general law was arrived at,
 connecting it either with chemical constitution, density, capillarity,
 or viscosity.*
    The following        are some     of the results, extracted from M.       Poi-

     M.  Poiseuille made a single determination of the rate of flow of
  blood  serum ; of blood serum plus a small and unknown quantity of
 corpuscles, and     of defibrinated blood, the       same   animal's blood (an
 ox's) having been used to furnish the three liquids.              The following

    Poiseuille points out that the aggregation of blood-corpuscles,
which always takes place in defibrinated blood, leads to a choking
of the tubes employed, especially when these are of narrow diameter
(CP™*-!),    or to an irregular    flow, and that consequently defibrinated
blood     cannot   readily   be injected       through   the  capillaries   of the
lungs    of  animals which have been bled to death.               The recent     ex
periments of       Dr  J. J. Miiller,* carried on under the direction, and
according to the method, of Professor Ludwig, in the Physiological
 Institute of Leipzig, are opposed to the statement of Poiseuille,
for he succeeded in keeping up for long periods a flow of defibrin
ated blood through the lungs.
                   Method employed in        the present research.
     All experiments     were conducted according to a method suggested
 by. and under the direction            of,  Professor Tait, in the Physical
 Laboratory of the University             of   Edinburgh.     The liquids to be
 experimented upon were allowed to flow through tubes of known
 diameter and length, into a large air-pump receiver exhausted to                   a
 partial and known extent, the fluid being thus subjected to the
 pressure    of the atmosphere, minus that of the air in the receiver.
     Before enumerating        our experiments, it may be well to point
 out certain fundamental        differences which exist between them and

    It   was   considered advisable to determine,                         in the first place,
whether bends in the tubes through which                              the liquids were made
to flow     would exert any influence on the rate.                              Accordingly,        a
tube 1129        millemetres          long     was bent twice at            right angles ; one

 exhausted      receiver, and the other was at a given instant immersed
in water.        The rate of flow having               been determined, the tube was
bent four      times at right angles, and the experiment repeated                                  ;   then
it was not       only bent four times at right angles in one plane, but
bent at one       point at an angle of about 135° to its former plane.
  The results           of    these    various       experiments             are      exhibited           in
Table    I.,   page 196.
  It    results from these experiments                      that the bends in the tubes
had no     perceptible influence in modifying the flow — the quantity
of fluid    flowing in the same time being directly                            as the pressure,
and very      much influenced by rises of temperature.
               II. — Mate     of  Flow   of  Defibrinated Blood               of   Sheep.
  Having         determined           that the       shape     of     the tubes exerted no
influence       on the flow of fluids                through        them, we proceeded                        to
examine        the comparative           rate     of flow of the defibrinated blood of
the sheep.        The results         are recorded      in Table        II.
  The tube used         in this experiment                   was 908-9 millimetres                     long,
and     was     twice bent at right angles.                      The diameter was                      1-214
millimetres.

     Exp. 43. — In this experiment a calf, about               a week  old, was made
 use of.      The jugular vein on the left side having been exposed, an
 opening was made into it as low in the neck as possible, and a
 flexible catheter was passed into the right side of the heart                       ;   the
 venous blood used was thus obtained.
     Thereafter      the carotid artery was exposed on the same side,
                                             ....
 and     a ligature     having     been     applied      on  the distal    side of the
 exposed     portion, a tube was introduced into the cardiac end.                    From
 this    tube was obtained the arterial blood used in the experiment.
     The temperature of the calf before the experiment                   was, 38°-8 C.
     After   the experiment,                                                     38°-7 C.

    From this experiment it would appear that the rate of flow of
 blood just drawn from the vessels of a living animal is very much
 greater than the rate of flow of blood which, having been defibri
 nated, has been allowed to stand for some time, as was the case in
 experiment         40.     In    defibrinated     blood the corpuscles tend un
 doubtedly to run together, and the masses thus formed by their
 coherence must necessarily account for the extreme slowness.                                The
 pure and perfectly warm blood flowed, indeed, more rapidly than
 did the serum obtained from ox-blood, which had been used in a
 previous experiment.              In   experiments         36, 37, 38, and         39,   it  was
 found that the time of flow of equal quantities of serum and water
 were represented by the ratio                 of 1-4:1.       In    experiments         43-49,
 it was found, on the other hand, that the rate of flow of equal
 quantities of pure blood and water were represented by the ratio of
  1-3:1.
     In   a former part        of this paper      we stated        that the diameters of
 the tubes used           by us differed from          those    of Poiseuille         in being
 much wider.

200                        Proceedings             of    the Royal Society
  As      was previously stated, the     French author found that in capil
lary tubes          of different diameter, the quantity of fluid flowing in
equal times through                    equal lengths, varies not as the squares, but
as the fourth          power of the diameters.                      In   the tubes used by us,
in the experiment above described, the diameter was such that the
quantities of water flowing through                               equal lengths           were,   cceteris
paribus, as the squares                      of the diameters.              It     is interesting      to
observe        in     connection            with experiments             43-53 inclusive,            that
whilst the amount of water flowing                                 varied very much as                the
squares of the diameters, the quantity                   of blood flowing through the
two tubes did not obey                      this law; the blood being retarded in its
flow more than water though by no means                                    to such an extent as
to show that, for               it,   the tubes obeyed Poiseuille's                law.

                                                    to                                                of
                                            Narrow Diameter.
  The clot           used was obtained by allowing                       ox's blood to coagulate,
and separating             it   from serum.
  Exp. 54. — In this experiment                          a   tube having    a    diameter of 1-162
millimetre           wasAlthough subjected to the whole atmo
                            used.
spheric pressure (700 M.) none of the clot would pass through the
tube.
  Exp.      55 and 56. — In this                   experiment        the same clot was used,
but   a   different tube.                 The clot       was   found freely to flow through
the tube, which had                   a   diameter of 2'00 millimetres.
  In      experiment 55 the pressure of                       a   column of mercury 24 inches
high    was employed.                     In experiment        56 that    of   a   column 29 inches
high was required.
 V. On      the      Rate of Flow of             Milk and Urine          through     Narrow       Tubes.
  The results of            these experiments are shown in the annexed table.
It will    be observed            that two tubes were employed in the determi
nation of the rate of flow of milk, whilst                               the two sets of experi
ments with urine were performed with one tube.                                      The rate of flow
of urine       is   shown to be almost identical                     with that of water, whilst
the rate of flow of milk                    is   about the same as that of water when                   a
large      tube       is   used,       but much           slower when          a    tube     of narrow
diameter        is    employed.

8.    On Cystine        (C5IT7N04S).              By James Dewar, F.R.S.E.,
    Lecturer        on Chemistry, Veterinary College, Edinburgh ;
    and     Arthur Gamgee, M.D., F.R.S.E., Lecturer                           on   Physio
     logy, at Surgeon's Hall, Edinburgh.
                                  Preliminary Notice.
    With the exception of the physical characters of this rare chemi
cal substance, which is only known                  as    an abnormal     constituent of
the human body, we know so very little, that even a few facts with
regard to its behaviour with reagents may not be altogether unin
teresting.
     Cystine     has the composition          C^H-NO^S ; and crystallises in the
 form    of six-sided plates.         It   forms with hydrochloric,              nitric,  and
 phosphoric acids, definite crystalline compounds.
      Some of the most important              facts with regard to the chemical
 reactions of cystine have been recorded                     by Dr Bence Jones, who
 for the first time showed that nitrous acid decomposes                        it with the
 evolution of nitrogen, and that in this operation the sulphur which
  it contained is oxidised to sulphuric                 acid, whilst a non-crystalline

202                 Proceedings   of the Royal Society
substance is left which is precipitable by nitrate of silver, mercuric
chloride, as well as by acetate of lead.
    The cystine      used in our experiments     was   obtained from     two
portions of calculi, one of which was furnished to us by Professor
Maclagan, the other by the Royal College of Surgeons of Edin
burgh.       The cystine  was obtained by treating    the pounded calculi
with strong liquor ammoniae, which dissolved the greater part, and
allowing      the solution   to evaporate   at a very gentle    heat.   The
cystine which separated was then again dissolved in ammonia and
recrystallised.
                  Preparation  of Hydrochlorate of   Cystine.
     One gramme of cystine was dissolved in boiling hydrochloric acid;
 on cooling beautiful needle-shaped crystals separated,         which were
 very soluble in water.      When thoroughly dried in     vacuo over  quick
 lime the crystals were found not to be readily soluble in water.       0'05
 grm, of crystalline hydrochlorate of cystine yielded 0'0452 grm. of
 AgCl, corresponding to 22 2 per cent. of HC1 (Calcd. 22-5).
                    Action of Nitrate of Silver on Cystine.
     Cystine was dissolved in strong solution of ammonia, and to the
 solution was added a solution of silver nitrate in ammonia.              No
 precipitate occurred, nor did the solution darken in the cold.       When
 slightly acidified with nitric acid, a canary-yellow precipitate was
 thrown down, which was collected and dried in vacuo.                The fil
 trate blackened when heated,        and on filtering off the black preci
 pitate    a  clear colourless solution   was   obtained,   which  was    not
  further blackened when boiled with ammoniacal solution of oxide
  of silver.
      On analysis the substance precipitated     proved to be a compound
  of cystine with nitrate of silver.
      In a  subsequent experiment an ammoniacal solution of cystine
  was boiled with an ammoniacal solution of nitrate of silver.             A
  black precipitate fell which     consisted of sulphide of silver.      The
  filtrate from the precipitate of sulphide of silver was subsequently
  treated with solution of chloride of ammonium to separate the
  excess   of silver.   The solution  was found not to be precipitated by
  hydrochloric acid and chloride of barium, nor by sulphate of cal

cium.    It  is therefore evident that when an ammoniacal solution of
cystine is heated     with ammoniacal solution of oxide of silver, the
sulphur   is separated entirely as sulphide of silver, none being
oxidised  ; it is also obvious that no oxalic acid is formed.
       Action     of Caustic  Soda and Caustic Baryta on Cystine.
   Cystine, when treated with pure solution of pure NallO,                and
evaporated    in a silver basin, gives      a reddish   fluid  ;  sulphide of
sodium is then       produced, blackening     the basin, and ammonia is
copiously evolved.        On treating the residue with water,         neither
sulphuric nor oxalic acids can be detected.           The liquid contains,
however, a     large quantity of sulphide of sodium with a mere trace
of sulphite.
   Cystine, when heated to 150° C. with solution of caustic baryta in
sealed tubes,      gave off ammonia, a large quantity of sulphide of
barium, a smaller quantity of sulphite of barium, and a trace of
hyposulphite       being formed.     No trace of sulphocyanide could        be
detected.
            Action of Alcoholic Solution of Potash     on Cystine.
   Cystine    was heated for several    hours in a sealed tube at 130° C
with an alcoholic solution of potash.          At the conclusion of the
experiment       a small    quantity  of dark sticky matter        was found
adhering to the tube, which contained a yellowish fluid.            The latter
smelt strongly of ammonia, which was            separated    by distillation.
The residue was acidified with dilute sulphuric acid, and shaken
up   with ether.        Ether left   a yellow  non-crystalline     substance,
 possessed   of   an indefinite but disagreeable odour.     This    substance
 had a strong acid reaction, and was found to contain no sulphur.
                   Action of Nascent Hydrogen on Cystine
    When cystine is      added to a mixture     of tin or zinc and dilute
 hydrochloric      acid, large quantities of sulphurated hydrogen are
 given off; the evolution of       gas gradually slackens,    till  even after
 the action     has gone    on for several   days, traces   of sulphuretted
 hydrogen continue to be given off.           When treated in the same
 manner taurine does not evolve H2S.
    It is to be noted that this evolution of H„S, when cystine is

 204                  Proceedings          of the Royal Society
 treated with tin or zinc and hydrochloric                   acid, might be used as a
 test for the substance, care being previously taken to separate any
 sulphide which might exist.
                       Action of Nitrous Acid on Cystine.
     Cystine was placed in water and a stream of nitrous acid gas
 passed     through     it.       No action took place until the water was
 heated   ;  it then commenced and                proceeded    briskly, with abundant
 effervescence,      until the whole of the substance              was dissolved.
    The clear solution contained                 a large quantity     of sulphuric acid,
 but not a trace of oxalic acid.                 When boiled with an ammoniacal
solution     of nitrate of silver, considerable reduction took place, a
 beautiful mirror of silver being deposited on the glass.                       The fluid
 was again       subjected to the action of nitrous acid                ; still no oxalic
 acid could be found, and the reduction of an ammoniacal solution
of oxide of silver continued.                 A portion of the fluid was treated
with carbonate of barium and heated                      ;  the clear filtrate bad an
alkaline     reaction,      and was abundantly             precipitated    by nitrate   of
silver and acetate          of lead.       The remainder of the fluid, after the
treatment with BaCO3, was treated with solution of nitrate of silver.
An abundant canary-yellow precipitate was formed.                               This was
suspended in water and decomposed                       with HaS ; the filtrate was
 evaporated to dryness, and presented the appearance                          of a sticky
solid.    It   was soluble       in water.       The   aqueous     solution was evapo
rated   and treated with absolute ether, which dissolved the greater
part.      The ethereal solution left                on evaporation       an  acid fluid.
This   was     dissolved in water, neutralised with ammonia, and pre
cipitated with solution of nitrate of silver.                  The yellow precipitate
obtained was amorphous              ; it  was  dried in vacuo.       Two specimens of
the silver salt prepared at different                  times were analysed by us.
The following        are the results of two analyses            : —
                  Silver,      .        .      .      56-9            57-5
                 Carbon,      .        .      .       19-43           21-32

    In considering the discrepancies of                  these    analyses, it must be
borne    in mind that we were              operating     in excessively small quan
tities of a substance prepared at different times by complicated
processes.

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1869-70.                             205
                                     Remarks.
     Cramer believed that cystine was          intimately related to the body
  called Serin,   CiH-NOi, which is obtained as one of the products
 of the action    of alkalies on silk. Serin, when treated with nitrous
 acid, yields glyceric acid, as alanine         under the same circumstances
 yields lactic     acid, and therefore         serin may be looked upon as
 amido-glyceric acid.
    Cramer further believed that cystine was a sulpho-amido-glyceric
 acid, i.e., serin in which    hydroxyl     has been replaced by        HS.
    This  supposed    relation is exhibited below —
             CHsOH                   CI^NH,                    CH2NH2
              CHOH                    CHOH                     CHSH
              CO,H                    C05H                     CO„H
                                Amido-glyceric   Acid
          Glyceric Acid.                                        Cystine
 Considering that this relation          of cystine     to serin     really exists,
 some    have argued that on treatment with               nitrous    acid, cystine
 should yield glyceric       acid.    We   do not, however, admit that this
 would really be the case.        If we   examine the case of sulpho-lactic
 acid,   an   analogous    body to the supposed          sulphur     derivative   of
serin, we find that, on oxidation,            it gives sulpho-propionic        acid,
and    therefore    we should,     in   the case of cystine, expect that            a
sulpho-acid would be formed on treatment with nitrous acid, were
it built up      as Cramer     supposed.       We   have   uniformly      observed,
during     the course of our experiments, that, however carefully we
attempted to regulate the action of nitrous acid on cystine, or of a
nitrite   on a salt   of cystine, the sulphur      separated   as  sulphuric acid
thus pointing to a material difference in its reactions from what
we should have expected from its supposed              constitution.     Although
we cannot       consider our experiments as definitive,            we can assert
that glyceric      acid is not a product of the action of nitrous acid,
and we venture to predict          that, in all probability,      cystine will be
found to be related to pyruvic         acid — to   be an amido-sulpho-pyruvic
acid.     We     base  this supposition on the near approach of the
analyses     of the silver salt of the acid obtained by the action of
nitrous acid on cystine, to the composition              of  a pyruvate, and     on
the general character of the         oily acid produced.
    We intend to pursue this subject further.

  9.     Notes from the Physical Laboratory of the University
                   By Professor Tait.             (With    a Plate.)
      After passing through the usual routine work of acquiring skill
 in the fundamental operations, several of my students have re
 mained long enough in the laboratory to make investigations                      in
 various branches of Physics.               A    great many of these inquiries
 related     to matters already thoroughly              known   ; but some     have
 claims to notice as dealing with subjects on which our information
 is   as  yet incomplete.       These     I propose,   from time to time, to lay
 before the Society.         Their value       as scientific results must depend
 on the skill and        care   of the experimenters.           For the forms of
 apparatus employed, and the mode of conducting the experiments,
 I   am,  in  most cases, responsible.
     (1.) Mr   J. P. Nichol    has made      a  long series of experiments upon
 the Radiation       and   Convection       of Heat, mainly to determine the
 amount of radiation         in absolute measure,         but incidentally with a
 view to finding how convection varies with the density of the air.
 The following is a preliminary notice of his work. The radiating
body was a thin spherical shell of copper, filled with hot water.
Its surface was sometimes bright, sometimes covered (by means of
photographic varnish) with lamp-black.                  It was suspended by fine
wires in a metallic vessel, which was blackened internally, fitted with
a pressure-gauge, surrounded by cold water, and connected                  with an
air-pump.        An iron cup     was let into the top       of the shell, and  con
tained a little mercury surrounding                the bulb of a thermometer
whose stem ascended         in   a  glass tube which was inserted in the lid
of the closed      vessel.     Considerable trouble was caused at first by
the water leaking out of the shell when its temperature was high
and the vacuum good — but                in the later experiments         this was
entirely got over.
     As it   was  suspected    that   a  difference of thickness of the lamp
black coating might influence the amount of radiation, the mode of
experimenting       finally   adopted     was to alter the air pressure      in the
vessel from time to time        ;  first, for instance, half an hour's cooling
at    100mm,  then half an hour at          200mm,   then at   100mm,  and so on.
But the portions of the curves of cooling thus found on separate
days fitted well together into a single continuous line, as is seen in

                     of Edinburgh,      Session 1869-70.                   207
the corner    of the diagram, where         the dotted lines   belong to one
day's experiments,      and the double lines to those of another day.
   The numbers (H) given in the following table, which is formed
from means      of many experiments, and which is shown graphically in
the diagram, express in grains the quantity of water which would
be heated     1° Centigrade    by the heat lost (by radiation and con
vection    jointly)   by one square       inch of surface    in  an   hour, its
temperature      being kept constant. With the apparatus employed,
it was not easy to keep the pressure lower than 10™" ; but the
curves for different pressures show that in this case the convection
must be small, so that (roughly) we may take the numbers given
for that pressure as representing the radiation alone.

   (2.) Mr A. Brebner made during last winter a number of careful
determinations of the polarisation of electrodes of various materials
in commercial sulphuric acid of various strengths and at various
temperatures.       The    process      employed was essentially the same as
that described by me in the Proceedings R.S.E. for May 31, 1869.
The following are means of many experiments :—

   The results of such experiments cannot                  be   expected to be very
accordant, but,       if  the means above           given    may        be   trusted, the
polarisation is less for       1  acid to 20 water than for either stronger
or weaker acids     ;  and    it  also falls  off more slowly with increase of
temperature.
   (3.) Messrs P. W. Meik and J. Murray made many observations
with an electric balance, and resistance coils, to test the change of
electric resistance produced in a wire by extension.                           The wires
tested were     of two specimens         of copper—one        of high, the other of
very low, conducting power.              They    were taken       of equal gauge and
of such lengths as to have almost equal resistance                   ;   one was associ
ated with a 10     B.A. Unit coil as one side of the balance, the other
had associated with it a box of resistance coils initially set at 10
B.A.U.       The value of the galvanometric scale was determined in
each   experiment        by increasing        by a small known               amount the
resistance of the coils in circuit.              The results       are not yet quite
reduced    ; as we require to know the linear extension, and                 (if possible),
the cubical contraction,            of each wire produced by the appended
weights.      But, even in their present state, they appear                        to be of
some consequence,        as they show changes         of conducting power almost
exactly proportional to the weights appended,                but singularly differ
ing in absolute amount for            these dissimilar    specimens of copper.

        David Milne Home, Esq., Vice-President, read the
                              following Address : —
  Gentlemen,          Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinrurgh, —
In compliance with          a special request       of the Council,         I   come before
you this evening to deliver the Address usually given at the open
ing of our Winter Session.
  This practice of annually taking stock to ascertain what business
we are doing, and how we are doing                 it,   seems to me very         right and
expedient.        The whole Society
                                  thus made aware whether
                                             is                                          it    is
retrograding or advancing, — whether      or  not, carrying out
                                                        it   is      is
the objects of its institution.
I      see that in some former Addresses, not only was the                              exist
ing    state   of the Society reported            on,    but occasion       was taken       to
open     up general views on science              and        literature, and sometimes
to point out important discoveries recently made in particular                          fields
of knowledge.  An Address of that instructive character probably
would have been given to-night, had the place    now unworthily      I
hold, been occupied by the distinguished                      savant who        stood   above
me on the       roll of Vice-Presidents, as he also stands immeasurably
above me       in knowledge.     That gentleman's numerous engagements
elsewhere, and the expectation that he would be in Italy,                                pre
vented his guaranteeing to the Council when they applied to him,
that he would be here to-night.        My own usual avocations are not
such     as fit me     for executing the duty which Dr Lyon Playfair
would have so ably performed, — my time being chiefly occupied
with the duties incumbent on              a    landed proprietor resident in the
eountry, who has to attend justice of peace courts, road meetings,
cattle       plague   committees, and          parochial           My address,
                                                                  boards.
therefore,       will not    be   literary     or scientific, but of   practicala
character as more           congenial     to    my habits of life; — containing
nevertheless some           information      and suggestions which          I     hope mny
not be entirely useless.
  What       I   shall venture to submit, will be under the followirg
heads    —
         :

               I.  Work of   the Society    during     the  past Year.
    The ordinary business of the Society, as we all know, is done
during the winter, at evening             meetings, when papers               are read.
These are abstracted into our printed Proceedings,                      and the most
valuable inserted verbatim in our Transactions.
    The number      of our meetings last winter               was     13, being on an
average     two, each month.         The number of            papers     read at these
meetings,     was 43.    The authors of these, were 33 persons.
    Of the 43 papers,    5 were literary      ;  the other 38 papers, on matters
of physical science.
    In  the previous year, the total number              of papers       had   been 44,
all  on physical subjects.
   The following epitome shows             the number           of the    papers  under

   In    a few instances, and       I   regret they were so few, discussion
occurred on the part of the         Fellows present, after the              papers were
read   or described.
   I  have said that all these papers appear                in    an abstracted form
in   our printed     Proceedings.         Last year's printed              Proceedings
extend     to 209 octavo pages.         Those of the year before, contained
200 pages.

234                 Proceedings     of the Royal Society
of publication in our Transactions.         The titles and authors of these
papers were as      follows : —
  1.  Reciprocal     Figures,   Frames, and Diagrams of Forces.          By  J.
        Clerk Maxwell, F.R.S.
  2. Scientific     Method    in the Interpretation     of Popular     Myths,

    I may here add that our volumes of Transactions               are  rapidly
exhibiting     an  increase in the number, — I hope      also in the value of
their contents.       About ten or twelve years ago, one year's Transac
tions did not exceed        100 quarto pages.       During the three years
which followed, their average          size was    measured by 250 pages      ;
during the last three years by 310 pages.
    The Society is aware that we have three prizes in our gift, created
by members of our body at different periods, — the Neill prize, the
Keith prize,       and   the Brisbane     prize.    A period of two years
elapses, in the case of the two latter, before bestowal.            Last year
the Keith prize was awarded,         consisting of a gold medal and £50,
" for the     best communication        on a scientific   subject."    It was
awarded     to Professor    Tait, for a paper, published in our Transac
                 "
tions, on the Rotation of a Rigid Body about a fixed point."

          Iu alluding to the           award    of this prize, it is only right to men
    tion    the  high estimation               in which, as             I
                                                                  have reason to know,
    this    paper and other mathematical                        papers by the same                    author
    are    held by men of science.                   These papers             are examples            of the
    application      and     use       of   a new    and wonderful             instrument         of    ana
    lysis invented by the late Sir William Hamilton of Dublin, one
    of the profoundest philosophers of his day, known by the name of
    "
        Quaternions."         I am      told that there are as yet few mathematicians
    who can    work with it. But Professor Tait has been able, both to
    work    with it, and to improve upon it ; and has applied it to the
    solution      of many important physical questions not easily solved
    by   ordinary analysis.
         To show that these remarks rest                 on better testimony than my own,
    I   beg to    refer to   the high appreciation of Professor                       Tait's applica
    tion of " Quaternions," as expressed by the distinguished inventor
    himself, in a work published shortly after his death. Sir William
    Hamilton's        "   Elements          of Quaternions"             (page 755) contains the
    following      passage     :   —
         " Professor Tait,
                        who has already published tracts on other applications of
    Quaternions, mathematical and physical, including some on Electro-dynamics,
    appears to the writer eminently fitted to carry on, happily and usefully, this
    new branch of mathematical               science,    and   likely   to become     in   it,   if   the ex
    pression may be allowed,           one of the chief successors           to its inventor."
      To these gracious words of Hamilton, may be added the testimony
    of Professor Sir William Thomson of Glasgow, himself       mathe                         a
    matician and physicist                  second      to none in Europe, contained in                     a
    letter to our General Secretary, from which                   I         am allowed to quote         : —
          " My Deae   Balfocr, — The
                                   marked appreciation by Sir William Hamilton
    of Tait's work in quaternions,  about the highest possible testimonial to its
                                              is
    excellence.  His book on the subject will constitute, believe, a permanent
                                                                             I
    monument of the most marvellously ingenious generalisation ever made in
    mathematical science.   It has already done much to render the new instru
    ment available for researches in Natural Philosophy, and     can see signs      I
    (witness the two most transcendent and practical naturalists of the age,
    Helmholtz and Clerk Maxwell) of quaternions becoming, through its teach
    ing,  useful implement, though many years may pass before fruits resulting
           a
     from quaternionic       husbandry can be gathered."
          Besides the ordinary              business of the Society for the past year

236                Proceedings      of the Royal Society
to which     I have been adverting,       there have been one or two other
matters taken up by the Council which it is proper to mention                  —
    (1.) The Council agreed to co-operate with other public bodies
in this town, in giving to the British Association for the Advance
ment of Science, an invitation         to hold    their next year's meeting
in Edinburgh.         That invitation     was communicated           through     our
general secretary,       Professor   Balfour,    at the Liverpool         meeting.
We all know the result        :  but perhaps all do        not know how much
is due to the efforts of this Society.           It    must also be matter        of
congratulation      to ourselves to learn,      that the President         elect  of
the Association      is one of our own members           — a member of whom
any Society may feel proud — Sir William                Thomson      of Glasgow     ;
and, moreover,     that the local secretaries and treasurer of the meet
ing    are all Fellows     of our Society.      May      I  therefore be allowed
 to express a hope, that the members of this Society                 will do  their
 utmost to assist in       promoting     the success        of the meeting,     and
 that the Society will be able to give a handsome subscription                    to
 the fund for expenses.
    (2.) Another matter out of the ordinary business of the Society,
 is the application which the Council made to Her Majesty's
 Government,      for the establishment of        a   Chair    of Geology in the
 University of Edinburgh, and for assistance to endow it.
     The circumstance which led to this application was the resig
 nation of Professor Allman, and an intimation received about the
 same    time, from that eminent geologist and true-hearted Scotch
 man,    Sir Roderick Impey Murchison,           that he was willing to set
 apart £6000 from his own funds, to yield              a   moiety of the endow
  ment.
     The Council of the Society, feeling that they would go with
 greater hope of success to Government             if  backed     by other public
 bodies,   obtained the co-operation         of the University, the Royal
  Scottish Society of Arts, the Geological Society, and the Highland
  and Agricultural Society.
     We all know, in consequence         of an intimation in the newspapers,
 that the Premier        has    so far  yielded     to   these   applications,    by
 agreeing that Government          should pay £200          yearly to  this object ;
 so   that, adding     the dividends    which     will     be  obtained from Sir
  Roderick    Murchison's    more generous       gift of £6000,       there  will be

                           of Edinburgh,         Session 1870-71.                           237
for   the   support of the chair,           a   fixed income of £450.            I    believe
there is in existence a separate                yearly sum of £35, hitherto           drawn
by the Professor of Natural History, and which, in the event of                               a
separate Professorship             being established for geology and mineralogy,
was appointed to be transferred                  to the latter.        This   bequest       was
made a number               of years     ago     by a    Scottish      gentleman      named
Thomson, who died at Palermo.
     Before   taking       leave   of this subject,      I   wish to draw attention to
the fact that in the other Universities                 of Scotland        the same incon
venience exists, which is about to be remedied in                       Edinburgh       ;   and
perhaps       I may be permitted         to express from        this chair    a hope, that
in them also, means may be found for removing that inconvenience.
Iwas glad to            observe, that the   Lord Rector of Aberdeen University,
in an address            delivered by him about ten days ago, took notice
of the multifarious              branches of instruction        which the Professor of
Natural History has there to teach, and is unable to overtake.                               Mr
Grant Duff is a member of the present Government, so that                             I trust
he   will call the Premier's             attention to the subject.            The chair of
Natural       History at Aberdeen          was established by the Crown, and its
occupant is appointed by the Crown.                      I    presume the design and
intention of the Crown was, that geology, and the other recognised
branches of Natural History, should be taught in that University.
                        in consequence of the extension and growth of these
               it if,
Therefore
branches,               has become     impossible       for any one man to give in
struction in all, there seems to be                 a    sort of moral obligation on
the Crown          to carry out its       own intention          and    undertaking,         by
appointing separate Professors for these branches.
     These remarks apply equally to the two other Universities                                of
Glasgow and St Andrews               ;   the latter, however, viz., St Andrews,
presenting an additional evil of its own, viz., the anomaly, that the
Professor of Natural History has to lecture on Civil History besides.
     It   humbly        appears to me that there             should be no great diffi
culty, both at St Andrews                 and at Glasgow,           of providing      means
for remedying            the evils to which      I      have been       adverting.          The
Government gives aid to schools to an equal extent with funds
supplied      locally for their support,            even      when these      schools are
of an       elementary        character, and supply             instruction    only     for   a
parish.       Much        more     must Government           be disposed    to assist when

   238                Proceedings    of the Royal Society
  the institution      wanting  help, draws scholars from a wide area           of
  country,    as is the   case with   a  University. What persons are so
   interested in establishing      means of instruction       in geology and
  mining, as proprietors of coal,       iron, shale, fire-clay, and building
  stones ? or who more able than they, to provide the amount           of funds
  necessary    to warrant an application to Government to assist in en
  dowing professorships for giving that instruction.             The counties
  of Fife and Forfar,       near St Andrews     ;
                                                  — the counties of Lanark,
  Renfrew, and Ayr, so intimately connected with Glasgow, are                  all
  rich in mines and minerals.         Surely the proprietors and manufac
  turers of both districts will have patriotism         enough to raise, by a
 conjoint    effort, the sum which one single individual           — their own
 countryman      — though not resident amongus,        has so cheerfully given.
      I have adverted to this subject so fully, because         of the interest
  which our Society, from a very early period, has taken in this
 particular    science.     Indeed, it is to geology that our Society is
 chiefly indebted for the reputation it first acquired in the scientific
 world, in consequence        of the animated and stirring speculations
 and discussions instituted       by its members,     among whom were Sir
 James Hall, Lord Webb Seymour, Col. Imrie, Hutton, Playfair,
 and Jameson.          I believe that little or nothing was known of
 geology, in Great Britain, before the time to which                    I   have
 alluded   ; and that even the Geological       Society of London, founded
in the year        1808,  owed   its origin   chiefly   to Scotsmen resident
 in England, who had imbibed their taste for the science by taking
part in the discussions, or studying the transactions of our Society.
When, from various causes, the science of geology at a later period
 begun to flag in Scotland, our Society lamented and remonstrated,
and endeavoured to waken public sympathy on the subject.                   Thus
the late Principal Forbes, in his address            from this chair in the
year 1862, says      :—
     " Of all the changes which have befallen Scottish science during
the last half century, that which           I  most deeply deplore, is the
progressive decay of our once illustrious geological school."
     In the year      1865,  our Society    presented a memorial         to the
Government of which Earl Russell was then head, pointing out the
inconvenience of there being no separate Professorship of Geology,
and asking Government to institute one.

                     of Edinburgh,      Session    1870-71.                     239
    Though our attempt to obtain redress was not then successful, it
may      be presumed   that good was done, by our having kept             it before
the eye of the      public;  and that seeds then were sown, which              have
now produced the results we had so long been desiring.
    II.   I  come   now to the     next division     of this address,        which
refers to
    The means we possess     of carrying out the objects of the Society.
   I allude to strength of membership, and to available funds.
   With regard to funds, I am happy to say that, though not rich,
we have      now rather   more   funds, than we have         ever     had before    ;
thanks      to our excellent   treasurer,   Mr Smith, who        does what he
can    to keep     up income,     and keep down unnecessary              expendi
ture.
   Our income      is derived from three main sources: —
      (I.) Contributions of ordinary Fellows, about               .     £800
      (2.) Dividends from capital invested,            .                  280
      (3.) Annual grant from Government,               .         .        300
                                 Making     a total revenue    of      £1380
   Our      expenditure    may be     classed    under    the   following       five
heads    :—
                                    ....
      (1.) Cost of printing and circulating Proceedings
                                                                    '
                and Transactions, about .               .         .     £400
      (2.) Rent of apartments, taxes, cleaning, &c.,             .        300
      (3.) Books, periodicals, and newspapers,         .         .        150
      (4.) Salaries of officers,                                         240
      (5.) Expenses of evening meetings,               .                   30
                                                                       £1120
   With regard to membership — the number of ordinary                      Fellows
— on whom of course we chiefly depend for papers, and for attend
ance     at our   evening    meetings,     stands thus.       This time last
year,    the total number was 303.           Since then,    30 new ordinary
members       have been elected    — making altogether        333.      But from

 240                  Proceedings of       the   Royal Society
 who have resigned — leaving            a balance at this date of 326;           which
 is a larger number of ordinary              Fellows    than we have had since
 the  institution of the Society.               The number of our honorary
 members     is the    same as formerly, 36 foreigners, and 20               British —
 all men of known celebrity.
    Before referring        more    particularly    to the individual        members
 who,  during      the past year, have been taken from us by death,
 allow me to say that           I  think   the   giving of obituary sketches of
deceased     associates      is a   practice    highly becoming.           It should
 be remembered that            our Society      is  intended,      not only     to aid
science and literature, but also to promote good fellowship among
the votaries of both.             One object of our association,            is to en
courage    and assist one another             by sympathy,         and   interchange
of views   ;  for which        purpose we      not only     listen to papers,      and
discuss these       at   our evening       meetings,      but also    hold personal
intercourse     in our library       and    reading-room.         When,     therefore,
any of our comrades are removed from our midst by death, it is but
fitting we should offer a parting tribute of regret at the dissolution
of our connection, and endeavour to fix some traces of our departed
associates    in our memory, by recounting the part they have taken
in helping to carry on the business of the Society, by recording
any services     rendered      to the country, and by noting the leading
events of their lives.
    Whilst    we    have    reason   to be thankful        that, during the past
year, the    number of deceased           associates    is small — smaller, when
regard is      had    to  the    total number       of   members,      than    in any
former year, that circumstance is more than counterbalanced                         by
the worth and preciousness of the lives whose loss we deplore.
    The following       are the names        of  deceased     Fellows,    of each of
whom    I proceed to give a short obituary notice              : —
                           Adam Hunter.
                           Edward Francis Maitland.
                           Rorert Nasmyth.
                           James Young Simpson.
                          James Svme.
   Adam   Hunter        was born at Greenock          on 20th     June,   1791.    He
obtained    his   classical     and   mathematical        education     at   Glasgow

                        of Edinburgh, Sm*ion 1870-71.                             241
  University, and afterwards            came   to Edinburgh for the medical
 classes.      He graduated in the year 1813.              He died in Edinburgh,
 24th June, 1870.
     In    the year 1815       he commenced practice           in Edinburgh as a
 family physician, and continued there in the same vocation all his
 life.     He was most attentive to his duties, very gentleman-like
 in his bearing, and an agreeable, social companion.                    He  possessed
 the regard and       esteem     of  the  late Dr Abercrombie, whose family
 he   attended    when any of its members were ailing.                  He  was with
 Dr Abercrombie           himself,    during his last illness; and, after his
 death,     he  wrote a     short biographical memoir of his friend and
 patient for the newspapers.
     In the year       1 839  Dr Hunter      became    a   Fellow of this Society.
 He was a member of the            Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh,
and     contributed a paper to its Transactions, on " Dislocations of
the    Shoulder and Hip-Joints."               He was a life member of the
 British     Association.        In   the year     1865,    he   published     an  in
teresting      pamphlet      of forty-one     pages   on     the    subject   of Life
 liistnance;      contrasting     the London       and Edinburgh offices,         and
showing the superiority of the latter, as regards honest adminis
tration and principles.           He    had been a policy holder in a London
office, as    well   as in the     Scottish   Widows'     Fund,     and  found how
much       more advantageous it was to be connected with the latter,
than with the former.
    Dr     Hunter     was    employed      by  the Directors        of the Scottish
National Insurance            Company      to make    a special       report on the
lives of the       assured     in that Company.          His report, which        was
printed, received much commendation.                  He had been the medical
adviser of       that Company since the year               1843;     as  also  of the
 English and       Scottish     Law Life Assurance Association, since the
 year     1847.    On the occasion of his death, the Directors of both
 Companies        passed     minutes,     expressing     the    very    high   regard
 which      they entertained for him.             Whilst his health remained,
 Dr Hunter's       practice was extensive        ;  and    his patients       had not
 only     full confidence      in his professional     skill, but derived great
 comfort from       his visits.    One of them writes thus        :
                                                                     " On more than
 one occasion       he    was the means,      in the hand of God, of saving
 my    life, and many, many times he has lightened my anxieties)

  242                 Proceedings    of the Royal Society
  and     cheered   my heart, in a way no one but himself             could   do.
  God was good to me, in giving me such a valuable adviser."
      In the year    1865,  Dr Hunter underwent    an operation for removal
  of   a  tumour in the throat.       But the  disease    was not eradicated.
  The tumour re-appeared, and continued            up to the period of his
  death, which took place suddenly.
     Dean Ramsay, to whose congregation Dr Hunter belonged, after
  his    funeral, alluded from the pulpit to him, in these terms:
  " He had for many years a very extensive medical practice in
  the families of this city, and no man more conscientiously, more
 carefully,     and more sedulously performed the duties of his pro
 fession.      From    the presence   of an impending      and  fatal malady,
 death had for some time been familiarised             to his mind.      But     I
 know how he met that monition, as he met all the trials of life,
 with a firm trust in the love of his Releemer, and with unshaken
 faith in the fulness of His atonement."
     Dr Hunter,       in  October 1820,    married    Elizabeth,    the  eldest
 daughter of      John Kircaldy, Esq.,    and by her had six children.
     Edward Francis Maitland, known after his elevation to the
judicial bench under the title of Lord Barcaple, was born in Edin
burgh, 10th April, 1808, and died there 23d February 1870.                   He
was the youngest son          of Adam Maitland      of Dundrennan, in the
county of Kirkcudbright — a property which a Dr Cairns of London
left to his niece, whom Mr Maitland married.              Edward Maitland's
elder brother was Thomas, who also was raised to the bench, under
the title of Lord Dundrennan.
    He received his education          at  the High School,      and    at the
University of Edinburgh,         and came to the bar in the year 1831.
*ie was possessed of considerable ability, and also of much general
knowledge derived from reading.            He  was shy and     reserved,    and
had an awkward manner, so that his real merits were less known
than they deserved         to be.   For many    years   he had   little or   no
business     as a  lawyer, and at one time in consequence        meditated     a
change of profession.         During this period of involuntary profes
sional idleness, he became editor of the "North British Review,"
and contributed to it several papers, which were characterised by
vigour      of thought,    and   correctness of composition.         Being    a

                     of Edinburgh,          Session 1870-71.                      243
 Whig in politics, when his friends obtained office, he received
 the appointment of Advocate-Depute.                    In the year 1851 he was
 made Sheriff of Argyle.              In the year 1855 he was appointed
 Solicitor-General,      which office he lost with the change of Govern
 ment; but in 1859          it   was restored      to him.       These professional
 appointments       afforded an opportunity             of showing     his qualifica
 tions   as a good     lawyer, and an accomplished pleader; and busi
 ness at length flowed in, so as to afford a handsome income.                      He
 was thoroughly conscientious           in the fulfilment of bis professionHl
 engagements.        When Solicitor-General,            it  was   remarked that he
 never missed being present            in the Justiciary         Court, and he was
always well prepared           with the business of which he had charge.
 There    were    several    cases    of public      interest    in which    he   was
counsel,— one of them the famous Yelverton                    case.   He  was senior
counsel for Miss Longworth,              and    evinced the utmost anxiety to
have    her claims properly presented.              Shortly   before her case came
on for discussion in the         Inner House, he received from the Crown
his commission to the bench. But he withheld it for a week, that
he might have it in his power to plead once more on Miss Long-
worth's behalf;       and    it   has been     stated,   that it took him       three
days' hard work          to   prepare    for the pleading.          He declined to
accept    of any remuneration for his services in this case. His title
of Barcaple was derived from              a  property of that name         which he
had purchased from his brother, David, a merchant in New York.
It   is situated in Kirkcudbrightshire, and                I believe not far from
the   family   estate of Dundrennan.
    It was in 1862      that Mr Maitland was raised               to the bench, and
it was in the same year that he became                   a  Fellow of our Society.
But he did not contribute any papers, or often attend our meet
ings.     He  was the first representative         of  the Edinburgh      University
Council in the University Court.                He   was also the first Rector of
Aberdeen University, after the union                   of King's and Marischal
Colleges in 1860.         Not being    able to understand how          Mr Maitland
should have       been    thought    of for this appointment,           being in no
way connected with            Aberdeen,      I  wrote    to  my friend     Principal
Campbell      for   an    explanation     ;  and    I   have    much    pleasure in
making the following extract from his answer: —
   " His appointment           to the office     of Rector was the result of         a

  244              Proceedings     of the Royal Society
  seveie and bitier contest between      the   friends and the opponents            of
  the union of the Colleges, or rather a portion          of the latter, for the
  more sensible and    disinterested opponents had by that time seen
 the necessity   of acquiescing in the union, and of either facilitating
 or not impeding the working of the University under the new
 arrangements.      The malcontents, whose object was to bring               about
 a dead-lock    and   embarrass the Universities'          Commissioners, in
 duced a party of the students to set up the late             Sir Andrew Leith
 Hay, who certainly      would never have been thought                of in other
 circumstances.      The friends of peace and order chose                Mr Mait-
 land, although — T perhaps ought to say,             because — he    was   totally
 unconnected with      this locality   and    district, and yet well-kuown
 as   a man combining       a  cultivated     mind with        the aptitude     for
 academic business, as well        as  the    firmness which         our circum
 stances required.
    " The   votes  of the Nations stood two to two, mid the casting
 vote   having  fallen  to me — the     Chancellorship        being     vacant — I
 gave   it in favour of Mr Maiiland, although, owing                 to  local in
 fluence   and intimidation,     the   aggregate       majority    of individual
 votes was   in favour of his opponent.           I   need not now say        any
 thing of the abuse and threats with which my decision was received
 by   many in the town, of the childish             and   abortive application
 to the Court    of Session for    an interdict,     or of the violence with
 which some of Sir A. Leith Hay's supporters attempted to inter
 rupt the installation,    and  the   Rector's address.          All  was amply
 repaid, to me, at least,   by Lord Barcaple's great services to the
 University, in circumstances of difficulty which the authorities of
a Scotch     University   have   rarely,   if   ever,   encountered — services
 which eventually gained for Lord Barcaple the esteem of most of his
opponents, and the lasting gratitude of the friends of the Univer
sity.   He made the duties of his office a matter of conscience. Not
withstanding    the demands on his time, of such              a practice at the
bar as his, he never hesitated to come to Aberdeen when required                  ;
and   I can  safely say that no Rector in Scotland, during his three
years' tenure of office, has ever attended an equal number of meet
ings of Court and Council.         His inaugural        address   was in a high
degree sensible, elegant, and scholarly, but         I  do not remember       that
it  was remarkable for anything      in the topics or mode of discussion.

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                               245
    " Lord
               Barcaple     was a    Whig    and   a Free    Churchman.          I   am
neither.       But there     are few men       whose   memory        I  cherish with
greater veneration."
    Lord Barcaple's         inaugural     address    referred     to   by Principal
 Campbell,      I  have,   since receiving      the Principal's letter, had an
opportunity       of reading.        It contains an admirable summary of
the duties of       University students, and also of the temptations to
 which    young men of their age are exposed.                  The language em
ployed     is correct and forcible       —clearly indicating         that Lord Bar
 caple was a person         of high intellectual      powers, and of cultivated
 mind.
    Lord Barcaple, though of decided political views, was too con
scientious     to be a party man.         His friends    had     looked forward to
his   holding the      office  of Lord Advocate,        and    going into Parlia
ment.      It   was   probably lucky       for him that he did not undergo
this ordeal, as the exercise           of patronage in     a party      spirit would
have   been     to him      a perpetual      misery.    It   is understood        that,
soon   after    he became        judge,   he   regretted    his elevation,        as  it
not   only greatly       lessened     his emoluments, but imposed             on   him
more   onerous      duties than he was able comfortably                to discharge.
The death       of Lord Manor, and the unaccountable delay on the
part of Government            in filling up the vacancy, threw on Lord
Barcaple a very large amount of judicial work.                     The load proved
too   much, and he broke down             ;  continuing,   however, to the very
last the performance         of duty.     If, in  consequence       of his reserved
habits,   Lord Barcaple        had    not many friends, he had no enemies.
His amiable dispositions, and strictly truthful character, ensured
to  him a peaceful life, and the esteem of all who knew him.
    Rorert Nasmytii         was bom in      Edinburgh in the year 1792. He
 died there, 12th      May, 1870. He was educated first at the High
 School, and      when about fifteen years old went to the Univer
 sity  of    Edinburgh.         Intending     to belong     to    the medical pro
 fession,    he first became       a pupil   of Dr Barclay, then          an   extra-
 academical lecturer on anatomy.               Ultimately     he    became his pro
 sector, and      was always seated beside him during the lecture.
  At first he seemed inclined to adopt surgery as his profession.
  In the year 1823 he became a Fellow of the Royal College of

    246                 Proceedings of          the  Royal Society
    Surgeons — Syme also            being elected       about the same time.                He
   was intimate        with Syme,        Liston, Fergusson,          and Wardrop,          and
   often assisted      these     eminent      surgeons when they operated.                  He
   afterwards       went to London,            and there was led to study                 den
   tistry.      He probably       foresaw,     that there would          be   a   favourable
   opening in Edinburgh,              when Dr Law, who had               a  large practice
   as a   dentist, died or retired.
       Mr Nasmyth,          when     he began      practice in Edinburgh,             was  the
   first who united the profession of             a dentist, with the education and
   qualifications of      a  surgeon.       He soon succeeded in obtaining public
   confidence.
      He     wrote   very few scientific papers.              The    subject of his        in
                thesis had      been     " Tic Douleureux          "           in the year
   augural                                                       ;    and,
   1843, he communicated to the London                    and Edinburgh          Journal of
                                                                       "
   Medical      Science    a  comprehensive paper on the                  Physiology and
   Pathology of the Teeth."              I  understand that most of the prepara
  tions in the Museum of the Royal                     College of Surgeons in this
  town, to illustrate the development of the teeth, were made by                           Mr
  Nasmyth.
      The     late   Professor      Goodsir      was     for   seven      years     assistant
  to   Mr Nasmyth,            and   has    publicly    acknowledged          the valuable
  instruction      he   received      from him.         In   1842    Mr Nasmyth was
 elected a      Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,                     but   I  do not
  think     he contributed        any papers or notices to our transactions.
  He     was    vice-president       of the Odontological          Society of London,
 and     had     been   so for thirteen        years   before    his death.         He had
  held the offices of surgeon-dentist               to   King George IV.,           to  King
 William, and also to Queen Victoria.                    He was a person of affable
 manners, and easy access.                 Dr Smith of Wemyss Place informs
 me     that he kindly gave             him much assistance           in preparing the
 lectures which he delivered in Surgeon's Hall, and also in estab
 lishing the Dental Dispensary of Edinburgh.
     Mr Nasmyth had in all four sons and four daughters.                                 Two
 sons     successively followed           for a time their father's profession               ;
 but both died of consumption, as well as a daughter and another
.eon.      His third     son was an officer in the artillery,            and    highly dis
 tinguished himself in the defence of Silistria.
     Mr Nasmyth           had   a much       larger and longer practice, in his

peculiar vocation, than              any one before in      Edinburgh.         He was an
agreeable companion,             a   fast friend, and possessed of much general
knowledge.          He will long           be remembered     as a   skilful dentist,    and
a highly respected citizen of Edinburgh.
     James Young          Simpson     was     born   7th June       1811,   and died 6th
 May                                   of Midwifery in the Uni
          1870, being at the time Professor
 versity of Edinburgh. His birthplace was Bathgate.    The house
 in which he was born,      understand, still standing.
                                     is,
                                      I                   It                            is   a
 two-storeyed slated house, part of which has been converted by his
 brother     Alexander        into   a   hall used for meetings of various kinds.
 His father kept          a   baker's shop.           His grandfather        was   a   small
 farmer.      He     was the youngest of seven               sons   ;    and was sent        by
 bis father      to the parish school.
     He    was sent       to Edinburgh         University    to study medicine,         and
 his    expenses there were paid by his eldest and now only surviving
 brother, Mr Alexander               Simpson of Bathgate, to whose                 kindness
 and brotherly care he was infinitely indebted.                          His parents both
 died      when he was young.                Whilst    studying         in Edinburgh, he
 lodged with his brother David, then in business as                           a    baker     in
 Stockbridge.
     His    taste    for books       in his boyhood was remarkable.                 He was
 constantly        to be seen    sitting     at the corner of the fireplace devour
 ing any      books      he could get, and oblivious of the               talking or   noise
 around him.
     In the Humanity          Class, he attracted the attention and patronage
 of Professor Pillans, who, learning that he wished to study medi
 cine, but that he was scant of funds, recommended him to com
 pete for    a     bursary endowed for the support of boys of the name                       of
 Stewart      or    Simpson.         This advice       he followed.         An extended
 study of Latin and Greek was however required.                           He succeeded       in
 gaining     the bursary, thereby drawing £10 yearly for three years.
     In the year      1832 he obtained his medical degree, and was imme
 diately afterwards elected by his fellow-students — among whom he
 had    become       a   favourite — to be Senior           President       of the Roya
 Medical      Society of Edinburgh, — an institution                     which, for about
 a   century and      a   half, has been supported chiefly by the University
 medical students.

248                   Proceedings of          the     Royal Society
    Young Simpson's graduation thesis                          so pleased        Professor John
Thomson,        who held the Pathological                      Chair,    that he made           him
assistant in his house,                and employed him                in the arrangement of
his library     ;    and    in this new        position he              made rapid progress,
not only sucking in all the knowledge which                                the    Professor     pos
sessed, but venturing              on views and speculations of his own.                           He
was permitted occasionally to read                    the       Professor's       lecture to the
class when the latter was unable from feeble health to do so — the
Professor       himself,      however, being              generally       present.      It    seems
that young Simpson did not always confine himself                                   to the mere
reading of the lecture,                 but presumed occasionally                   to introduce
verbally an exposition              of his own ideas,             to    the surprise     of     both
students and Professor.                 The latter,   on one occasion,             having heard
some      new       and    startling     propositions           from the chair,         after      the
lecture was over, expressed his dissatisfaction                          in the retiring-room
by saying to his young assistant,
                                  "                   I   don't believe one word of                 it,
sir."
    Simpson having acquired some confidence in his own powers,
thought of setting up for himself; and seeing in the newspapers
an advertisement that              a   doctor was wanted to attend the poor                         in
the     parish of Innerkip          on the    Clyde, he offered              himself.        But    he
was     rejected.  He used            to say that he felt this disappointment                   more
keenly than any he ever met with in after life.                             I     may add       here
what    I   think Simpson           once told me, that an old-established                     medi
cal practitioner in         a    town not far from Edinburgh,                    wishing to get      a
young licentiate           as an   assistant, and who might ultimately                       become
a     partner, gave out           a    subject for an essay among the medical
students of the Midwifery Chair, intending to judge of their quali
fications       partly      by     their   essays         and     partly     by     conversation.
Simpson gave in an essay, and was one of those sent for, but                                       was
again doomed to disappointment                 ;    though from this village doctor
he received much friendly counsel and                      a   promise of future patronage.
      During    the next two or three years, he continued                           to prosecute
his studies, chiefly             in obstetrics, and read several                   papers     in the
 Royal Medical Society.                 He also visited France.                   He now      began
to form     a      of preparations and objects bearing on anatomy,
                museum
 and at length announced his intention of giving public lectures.
 These be continued for three years,                        and they obtained so much

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                             249
success, tiiat he probably then conceived the idea, in the event of
a   vacancy in the University Midwifery Chair,                 of offering himself
as a   candidate.
    In the year 1839       the venerable      Dr Hamilton, who occupied that
chair, died, on which          event Simpson became        a   candidute, support
ing his claims by an octavo volume               of 200 pages of testimonials,
and accompanied by a catalogue              of the museum      which, in the short
space    of three     years,   he bad formed, containing         no less than 700
obstetric preparations.          The assiduity with which         he plied his can
vass, and the steps he took to overcome              objections, may be judged
of from the circumstance that one of the magistrates (the present
Lord Provost of this city) having stated it as a drawback, if not a
disqualification, that he was an unmarried man, Dr Simpson replied,
" I admit
              it is a disqualification, but it may perhaps be removed.''
The next day          he  started for Liverpool,        and contracted a mar
riage there     wiih   the daughter      of Mr Walter Grindlay.            In   about
ten days     thereafter, he returned to Edinburgh            ;  and having called
on    Bailie   Law,    he    informed     him of the step he had taken in
deference to      his opinion,    and then claimed a promise of his vote           —
 which he at once received.            It  was by that vote he won the           Pro
 fessorship.
     Alter Simpson was elected, there were confident predictions that
 the  obstetrical class in the University would fall off, and that many
 fewer    patients would come to Edinburgh to be under the Pro
 fessor's care.      Animadversions        fell freely  on the     magistrates,     as
 patrons of the chair, for electing a man without either experience or
 reputation,    instead of his opponent, who had both.               These antici
 pations soon      proved to be utterly          unfounded.       After Simpson's
 election the     Midwifery Class was crowded. Not only did students
 flock to it    in greater numbers even than formerly, but medical
 officers of the navy and army, when home on furlough, frequently
  attended to     hear the original views of the youthful                Professor,
 and    were   delighted     by the aptness of his illustrations            and   the
  earnestness    of his style of lecturing.
     He also carried on obstetric investigations           and experiments         on
  various points    of difficulty, accounts of which          were given by him
  from   time to time in        papers read      at Societies,     or inserted      in
  niedical journals.        He    soon    came    to be employed        extensively

cases, both novel and instructive,       trying improved methods.

At the same time, he was acquiring a complete knowledge of all
that had been written by others, not only in Europe and America,
but even by the Greeks and Romans, — his good classical knowledge
in this respect proving serviceable.                       He allowed himself very             little
sleep   ;    and even in the houses of his patients, whilst waiting in                           an
adjoining         room   till his services             were required,        used    to   write out
papers, or arrange materials for them.
     His mind         was     so exuberant             and versatile, that it often flowed
over and beyond the pale of his own special department.                        Thus,
one    of his     papers      read    before       the Medico-Chirurgical Society in
                                 " Antiquarian
1841        was   entitled,                               Notices      of Leprosy and Leper
Hospitals in Scotland and England."                                   Another had this title,

  His great delight, and therefore his incessant aim, was to search
out something new;                and for this purpose,               whilst he rausacked his
own brain, he did not disdain to rummage among the rubbish                                        of
old authors, or to talk with any one who had anything to com
municate on any topic                      whatever.          One of the subjects, in his
special department, which interested him greatly, was the use                                     of
anaesthetics.            He    had     read       of    the    experiments          performed     in
America by several               surgeons and dentists, to render their patients
insensible to pain by inhaling sulphuric                            ether.       He did not      see
why this substance               should not be used in obstetric practice.                      Ac
cordingly,        he administered           it   to one of his patients for the purpose
of lessening the pains of parturition.                           This    case occurred on        the
19th        January      1847.       Before that time, no one had ventured on
such    an experiment.               It    was entirely successful           ;   and he     thought
it   so important           that, next day,             he communicated             the    discovery
to his class, and gave a special report                       of it   to the Obstetric Society.
The case got into the newspapers,                        and   within     ten days the process
was repeated          successfully in the hospitals of London                             and Paris.
During        the   following six months, Dr Simpson continued the uss
of sulphuric ether both in the Edinburgh hospitals and in private
practice, resorting            to    it,   however, only in cases where nature had
to be assisted.             Simpson found several                 drawbacks in the use of
sulphuric ether,            and in consequence            began        to search    for something

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                                            251
better.         One    of    the many substances he tried was chloroform,                             —a
liquid discovered in 1832 by two German chemists, and first accu
rately investigated              and described in 1835 by Dumas                       of Paris.       The
trials which Professor                 Simpson       made with the vapour                 of this     sub
stance, and which                 led him      to adopt         it,   took place in November
1847.           But    it   is    right to add        that, though               he   discovered its
suitableness for the purpose wanted, and was the first to introduce
it    into surgical practice, the idea of so using it, had occurred to
others previously,               and    trials had even been made with it.                          Thus

to the          Apothecaries'          Company there, being in Edinburgh during
the month              of October        1847,      called on Professor               Simpson;         and
 on       the    Professor        telling     him     that he           was      seeking     for some
 better anaesthetic              than sulphuric ether,           Mr Waldie            spoke to him      of
 chloric ether, and advised                 him to try pure chloroform unmixed with
 alcohol.             He asked         Mr    Waldie to submit to anaesthesation by
 chloroform, but             Mr Waldie        was not      willing         to risk the experiment.
         Acting       on    this hint, Professor            Simpson procured —             I     believe
 from        Professor          Gregory —    a     small   quantity             of pure chloroform,
 which, however, he did not at the moment make use of.                                           It    was
 put aside, to be tried with other substances at                                 some     more    conve
 nient opportunity.                Late      one    evening —         it   was the 4th November
 1847      — to quote from Professor Miller's pamphlet, Professor Simp-

         I                                                                                        Medical

son resumed       his experiments, aided by his two friends                  and   assist
ants, Drs Keith and           Matthews Duncan —
   " Having inhaled several substances, but without much effect, it occurred
to the Professor to try a ponderous material, which he had formerly set aside
on a lumber table, and which, on account of its weight, he had hitherto re
garded   as of no bkelihood whatever.         That   happened    to be a small bottle    of
chloroform.     It  was searched     for and recovered from beneath a heap of waste
paper.    With each tumbler newly charged, the inhalers resumed their voca
tion. Immediately an unwonted hilarity seized the party. They became
bright-eyed, very happy, and very loquacious— expatiating on the delicious
aroma of the new fluid.         The conversation was of unusual intelligence, and
quite  charmed     the listeners  — some ladies of the family, and a naval officer,
brother-in-law of Dr Simpson. But suddenly there were sounds like those of
a cotton mill, louder and louder.         A moment more, then all was quiet ; and
then  — a crash.      On awaking,       Dr  Simpson's first perception was mental.
. This is far
               stronger ami better than ether,' said he to himself. His second
was, to note that he was prostrate        on the floor,  and  that among      the  friends
about him there was contusion and alarm.            Hearing    a noise, he turned    round
and saw Dr Duncan         beneath     a chair, his jaw dropped,    his eyes staring,    his
hoad bent half under him, — quite unconscious,          and   snoring in   a  most  deter
mined manner.        More noise still, and much motion, caused by Dr Keith's
legs milking valorous      efforts to overturn the supper-table.        By and bye, Dr
Simpson having regained his seat, Dr Duncan having finished his uncom
fortable slumber, and Dr Keith having come to an arrangement with the
table, the sederunt was resumed.           Each expressed himself delighted with the
new agent, and its inhalation          was repeated   many times that night — one of
the ladies gallantly taking her place at the table — until the supply of chloro
form was exhausted.         In none of these subsequent inhalations, however, was
the experiment pushed to unconsciousness.            The first event had quite satisfied
them of the agent's full power in that way.           The festivities    on the   occasion
did not terminate till three in the morning."
    Such is the graphic account given by the late Professor Miller                       of
 the way in which         Simpson discovered the properties of chloroform
 vapour.     The value of         the discovery depends upon the             superiority
of chloroform to sulphuric ether, the anaesthetic previously employed
 in medical practice; and its superiority was manifested thus, viz. —
 1st. That   a much less quantity of chloroform answered                   ;
                                                                             — 2d. That
                                                    —
 insensibility came on more rapidly ; 3d. That no special instru
 ment for its administration was required; — ith. That the odour
 was more agreeable.
    On the 8th November 1847, this new anaesthetic                      was employed
 by Professor Simpson in             a case   of labour for the first time, and
 with complete success.             It  soon   became     known in the profession.

and it has in this country almost superseded every other anaesthetic,
both for aiding       parturition      and    for numberless surgical operations.
In   these operations, especially,            it   has been    of incalculable             service,
not only by relieving from suffering, but by saving life.                              I   observe
a   statement by an American army physician made lately at                                 a   public
meeting in Washington that — *
    " In   the Crimea and Italian campaigns, chloroform was employed                           without
asingle disaster.      A similar result attended its use during the seven                       weeks'
Austro-Prussian       war.  In our own unhappy struggle [he alludes                             to the
American      Civil War] chloroform          was    administered in more than 120,000
cases, and    I am unable to learn of        more than eight cases          in which a fatal
result can he fairly traceable       to its use."
   The immense quantity of chloroform manufactured, is a suffi
cient proof of the trust universally placed in     and of the               it,
immense amount of human suffering relieved by it.                                    In October
1869,       when    the freedom of this city was bestowed                         on Simpson,
he mentioned          that the distinguished              firm of apothecaries in Edin
burgh, who manufacture chloroform, were making                             it   in   such quan
tities as to yield about 8000 doses daily.                         On    inquiry last           week,
I    learnt    from    Mr Flockhart, that the quantity                       of chloroform
now        manufactured      in this town           is   about double what             it      was   a
year ago, partly in consequence of the sanguinary                               European war
which       has raged       for the last       five months,            but chiefly         in con
sequence of the rapidly               increasing         use of chloroform in general
practice.          Mr Flockhart told               me    that just before Paris was
invested, he sent to the medical                    staff there 1000 bottles of                  1   lb
each, — which he heard had reached their destination.                             He       also sent
800 bottles to the Germans.                   These went chiefly to the army of
the Crown Prince.
     Numerous        were Simpson's          discoveries and improvements, even
in departments of medicine which lay outside of his own special
field.      The stopping of          haemorrhage           from cut arteries          is   effected
by ligatures or torsion.             He proposed          pins or needles,           by which to
close the artery.
     With     a    view to arrest the spread              of epidemics,         he urged the
complete isolation           of the patients            affected   ;   maintaining         that, as
rinderpest could be stamped out by the immediate slaughter of
cattle attacked        by   it,   so scarlet fever, measles,            hooping-cough, and
                       * Ed. Med. Journal for Nov. 1870, p. 473.

  254                 Proceedings     of the Royal Society
 even     small-pox      might   be,   if  not extinguished,      at   all events
 arrested,    and so cease to be epidemic, by strict conlinemtnt              and
complete isolation of the first individual attacked.
     His views      on the subject of large hospituls were founded on         the
same      principle.     He insisted that, where large numbers of sick
 persons     were    accommodated in one building, the atmosphere of
 the building became          tainted, so that the patients had less chance
of recovery       ;  and this position he attempted to prove, by contrast
ing the proportion of recoveries in hospitals with              those in private
dwellings.*         On these grounds Simpson advocated         the abolition   of
large hospitals in towns, and the substitution of detached cottages
in the country; but if hospitals were to be retained, then instead
of   wards, with from fifty to one hundred beds in each, and reached
by lobbies and         staircases inside of the house,       he urged that the
wards should contain as few beds as possible, anil that access should
 be had to      them by stairs outside of the hospital altogether.
     That the principle on which these views are based, as                 to the
expediency of isolating persons afflicted with any complaint                what
ever,    is a sound one,       none   cau   doubt, who has read       the recent
discoveries of minute and invisible organic dust in the atmosphere,
consisting       in many     cases   of  germs — germs which, inhaled,        and
entering the blood, engender diseases in the body.
     I see   it  stated   in a  well-informed    medical paper that, among
    * In the speech which he made on receiving the Freedom of the City, he
remarked that — " When such u simple operation as amputation of the fore
arm is performed upon a poor man in the country, and in his own cottage
home, only about one in 180 dies.          But the statistics of our large metro
politan hospitals disclose the stern and terrible truth, that if these men had
been inmates of their great wards, thirty of them, or about one in six, would
have perished ; a fact, among many others, which calls earnestly and strongly
tor somo great reform in our large hospitals, if these institutions are to main
tain their ancient character as the homes of charity and beneficence."      These
statistics applied to the amputation of the arm. He gathered similar statistics
from the hospitals, and from country practitioners, in regard to amputations
of the leg, which showed that these amputations in like manner were always
more successful in the country than in town hospitals, notwithstanding the
greater skill of town surgeons ; and ho deduced the following conclusions : —
"  1st. That about three times as many patients die after limb amputations in
our large hospitals, as die from the same operations in private and country
practice.     2d. That to reduce the death-rate from operations in our surgical
hospitals, we should strive to assimilate their form and arrangements to the
condition of patients in private and country practice."

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                                255
Professor Simpson's            unpublished       papers,   some    notes have       been
found      bearing on hospital reform.             That   he felt there was some
thing more which           he could have done on that subject, is evident
from      a   remark     made     during his        last  illness,   when     informed
that his recovery was doubtful.              He said that his principal reason
for desiring       a prolongation      of life,    was that he might do a          little
more service in the cause           of hospital reform.
    These suggestions          for improved practice, in the various depart
ments       of the medical profession, exposed Professor                   Simpson to
much controversy.              Naturally zealous and ardent, and knowing
that energy and perseverance              were    required for any reform which
was     likely to disturb        old customs, or existing interests, he fre-
i|uently      drew down on himself opposition                of  a disagreeable and
 personal character.           Thus, with reference to his proposal to sub
stitute acupressure for deligation, the Professor of                Clinical Surgery,
 in the same       University, complained bitterly of his interference in
 matters     alien to the midwifery chair; observing that he had not
 interfered,     as he might        have done,       to denounce certain         useless
and often dangerous             innovations     introduced     in the treatment of
 diseases    of women.
    The      amount      of private      practice      which    Professor      Simpson
 obtained,      not only in bis own special              department, but even          in
 other cases,      is probably greater than any               one   ever before pos
 sessed.        No other result could          be expected,       as the discoveries
 and    improved      practices which emanated from him, indicated not
 ouly     knowledge       to    an immense         extent,    but  inventiveness       in
  meeting      the   most difficult      cases.       He had also       an    agreeable
 oxpression       of countenance,         and     a   melodious      voice,    qualities
  which, in a sick        room,    made    his attendance doubly acceptable.
  I  have often       seen    in his    house,     after two o'clock,       a levee    of
  patients of    all classes, rich and poor, amounting sometimes to hun
  dreds, desirous      of consulting      him.      Not only     were   the drawing-
  room,     dining-room,       and library filled,       but even the lobby          and
  passages.      Frequently persons        had    to leave without being able to
  see  the Professor, after waiting         two hours.       A relative of my own,
  having      succeeded     in catching     him as he looked into the room
   where    she  was waiting, told her case to him.               He then, without
   wying anything,       left the    room, but immediately           returned with a
      t0t. VII.                                                              2 L

256                Proceedings       of the Royal Society
book, in which       he pointed     out to her the         part where she would
find   her ailment       described.      He     asked    her to    read    it whilst
he went to another patient, promising                  to come     back in a      few
minutes.       Having      read  the   passages,      and   waited    patiently an
hour, she rang the bell to inquire           for the Professor, and found          he
had left the house, having forgotten his promise to return.
   Professor Simpson was untidy in his dress, and on one occasion
much offended       a  lady of rank who called on him at his house, by
coming to see her in his
                                  " stocking soles."        Frequent     complaints
were made by patients, as to his want of punctuality                   in returning
to visit them.      One lady, having been desired by him to remain                  in
bed   till he returned again in a day or two, remained ten                   days in
bed, waiting for his return.          He had been called to the country,
and had forgotten this town patient altogether.
   It  was indeed not to be wondered             at that, with such multitudes
of objects engrossing his thoughts,            he should be occasionally         dis
tracted and diverted from his professional engagements.                       Never
theless, so great was the confidence reposed in his skill, that these
breaches    seldom caused        patients     to   forsake him.         Traps   were
often laid to catch him for attendance, or                a consultation.      With
that view persons went to his house to breakfast                    though     unin
vited, and they were always graciously received.                 Sometimes when
they saw his carriage standing           at a door, they used to get          into it
and wait    till the Professor came out from his visit.
   It  has been estimated, by those who had means                 of knowing the
extent of Simpson's          practice, that the number of strangers who
came to Edinburgh for his advice and treatment, must have caused
an expenditure        of  at least   £80,000 a-year among the hotel and
lodging-house keepers.
   It  is obvious that, on account of Professor              Simpson's extensive
practice,    the instruction      which    he was      capable of giving must
have been most valuable.            Nor   wus   it only in the class-room        and
to students, that        instruction    was    given    by   him.    He was ever
accessible to his professional brethren, and particularly                 to country
practitioners, when they were at a loss in cases of difficulty.                  One
of this last class,* who frequently resorted to him, having                     been
  * Dr  Turnbull of Coldstream.      H<- has allowed    me to quote from his letter.

                    of Edinburgh,        Session   1870-71.                    257
asked    by  me     for   any notices of his deeented          friend,   wrote as
follows : —
   " My own   success in practice, has been far beyond anything I ever antici
pated when I commenced it, now upwards of a quarter of a century since
and, beyond all question, I feci indebted to Simpson, more than to all my
other teachers put together.       He was loveable and winning to an extent
which   no words of mine can express.        I spent the forenoon of the day on
which he returned from the Morrtaunt trial with him. Then he performed
npon a patient of my own, a difficult operation, on which he showed great
resourco and skill,    probably  the last operation of importance he did. He
gave me an account      of the trial, and of Serjeant Ballantyne's examination.
He inquired most anxiously about Dr Watson's lecture given the previous
night at the Royal Collego of Surgeons,• at which I was present, and at his
absence from which he expressed great regret.         A part of the day on which
he died, I spent with Dr Warburton Begbie ; and when he told me that I
would never see Simpson again, adding ' I know full well how genuine has
been your mutual friendship for many long jears,' I could give no reply.
The tears stole down my cheeks, and I experienced then, and many a time
since, a genuine sorrow which I need not describe.         To his faults I was not
Mind, and for them he has assuredly been sufficiently abused by those who
think that he only was blameworthy. While I live, I shall never cease to
think of him, as I always found him, generous, attractive, and loveable, far
beyond any other man whom        I  ever met."
    Let  me add, that he did          not confine his teachings and coun
sel to students and to medical practitioners.               To all    and sundry
who     chose    to   consult    him,    and   who could      obtain access      to
him,    he was ever      ready   to open     up the stores of his wonderful
memory and inventiveness.               On the last occasion       that  I   had  a
lengthened conversation with him, he adverted               to the future pros
pects of medical         discovery,     and   pointed  out that these        would
depend more on the chemists than on any other class of inves
tigators.      He    remarked, how little we yet            knew     the reasons
why particular medicines were efficacious in arresting disease, and
said that he thought no medical student should receive                  a  licence
who was not an expert chemist.
    Whilst ready     to teach verbally, whether in the        University, or in
medical societies, or in his own house, he had          little taste for writing
medical books, but it was       a  recreation to him to Write on archaeologi
cal subjects.     The two large volumes          on obstetrics, which bear his
name, were published, not by him, but by two medical friends, who
undertook the labour of collecting             and  ananging his      papers and

notices, published and unpublished.                 In           to
                                                          the few words of preface
the first volume, written to express his gratitude to Dr Priestley
and Dr Storer who edited the work, Professor Simpson states that
most of the communications, which appeared in
                                                    " were written      it,
hurriedly, and amid the incessant distractions of practice."  He
      " If   had attempted to remodel, extend, and correct them,
adds,       I
they would never have been published in                     a    collected form."           Why
not, he explains           in his preface to volume second, in these words,
" The life of         a   busy accoucheur,     is     not   a     life fitted for literary
work.     Besides,    I     am quite deficient      in   some     of   the principal        quali
fications generally laid down as requisite for success                              in medical
authorship      ;    having no heart or habit for the daily written annota
tion and collection of individual cases and observations — no suffi
cient industry and endurance for the pursuit of any tedious and
protracted investigation,          and no great love              of lifting my pen, but
the very reverse."
    The   reasons      thus assigned by Professor Simpson why he would
never have published              these two volumes, must, of course, be
accepted.        But      there was probably another and               a   stronger reason,
which     it   might have been thought ostentatious for him to mention,
— and that       was his insatiable love     of discovery — his constant desire
to be ever          searching    for new truths, and to occupy as much                          of
his time as possible on fields where these truths were likely to be
found.         He would      have considered     it   a   waste of time to have gone
back on his           own    previous researches,         in order to present them
again before the world in the form of                     a      published work.             That
was   a   mechanical         labour which    he       willingly and wisely handed
over to the kind friends who voluntarily undertook                            it,   and thus he
was left free to apply his time and talents to the nobler business
of advancing human knowledge by fresh discoveries.
  His active and buoyant mind, not finding enough to occupy                                     it
within the circle of medicine, sought more work in other fields,
and hence he was led to become               a      member of various societies of
a   scientific      character.      The first that          he    joined after becoming
Professor of Midwifery,            was our own Society.                He joined       it   in the
year 1844, and contributed             the following papers, which were read
at our evening            meetings, and   afterwards printed in our Proceed
ings:—

elsewhere     ;    and the objects     of their erection.
     With reference        to this last paper, the    chief purpose of which     was
to refute     Professor       Piazzi Smyth's theory about the origiu and
object    of      the  Great Pyramid of Egypt, it has been publicly
 stated, by a person          who   alleges he knew the fact, that to enable
 him to test the correctness of Professor Smyth's calculations, and
 to write the papers above referred to, he devoted three weeks to a
 study of decimals and a perusal of astronomical                    works; —a   pro
 ceeding which shows the zeal and energy with which, even at a late
 period of life, he could take up a new subject.
     Another       Society,   unconnected      with    the    profession which    he
joined, and in the business of which he took almost inconceivable
 interest, was that of the Antiquaries              of Scotland. Every volume
          "                      " of that Society, after he joined it in the
 of the      Transactions
 year 1859, teems with notices from his pen                 ;  and a very consider
 able number of the articles in the Society's instructive                  museum
 were donations         from him.       I  have    heard that he had formed a
 kind of   map or glossary applicable            to both   England    and Scotland,
 showing     the      sites   of   curious   old buildings,      camps, or stand
  ing stones    ;   so that   on the occasion        of making any professional
 visits to districts where these relics occurred, he might contrive to
 see  them.
     When made         a  Vice-President of       the Society of Antiquaries,     be
 delivered an address, which for archaeological                 lore and acquaint
 ance with the early history of Scotland, astonished those who                   had
 made this subject a special study all their lives.                This address  was

260                       Proceedings         of the Royal Society
published, and had a motto from Wordsworth                                prefixed to it,    truly
expressive of the heartfelt pleasure which these researches                                gave   to
him.        The motto was —
                                               " I have owed to thura
                          In hours of weariness,          sensations    sweet
                          Felt in the blood."
      1   remember being so struck with this address, that after reading
it,
 I        begged    a   common friend to ask Sir James, how and when he
had       found time to compose                it.     His answer           was,    that   he had
written      it,   after twelve o'clock at night, as he always felt refreshed
by writing papers of that kind.                      There              paragraph at the con
                                                                 is
                                                                 a
clusion of this address, which deserves                           to be quoted        for its own
sake, and          because     it   led to an occurrence which illustrates                    Pro
fessor Simpson's readiness                 to aid in any good object.
  " In the name of this Society, and in the name of my fellow-countrymen
generally,   here solemnly protest against the perpetration of any more acts
             I
of useless and churlish Vandalism in the needless destruction and removal of
our Scotch antiquarian remains. The hearts of all leal Scotchmen, overflowing
as they do with    love of their native land, must ever deplore the unnecessary
                      a
demolition of all such early relics and monuments, as in any degree contri
bute to the recovery and restoration of the past history of our country and of
our ancestors.  These ancient relics and monuments are in one sense national
property,for historically they belong to Scotland and to Scotsmen in general,
more than they belong to the individual proprietors upon whose ground they
happen to stand."
      Shortly      after this address          was    published,        a     visit was paid by
the Berwickshire               Naturalists'    Club to       a   remarkable old fortress in
Berwickshire, called Edins Hald, situated among the Lammermuir
Hills.       Those members            of the Club who had known the building
in former years, were distressed to                   see how          much   it   had been muti
lated, and to hear, that             it   was about to be again used as a quarry,
for some stone dykes soon to be erected.                               The Club addressed      the
proprietor on the subject, with the view of obtaining                                  a   promise
to prevent further               dilapidation.            He, however, showed              no dis
position to grant our request.                       We resolved then to submit the
matter to Professor Simpson, on                      the faith of the admirable address
to which     I     have    just adverted.            It    turned out fortunately for us,
that the wife of the proprietor, who resided near Edinburgh, was
then attended             by   Professor      Simpson.           He willingly undertook           to
intercede with her on behalf of this old relic, and obtained from

                     of    Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                               261
her husband a      letter containing a writtenpromise to have the ruin
protected    from further injury ; which letter he handed over to the
secretary    of the Society of Antiquaries.
    Professor    Simpson made several visits             to Northumberland,            to
examine       the sculptured          rocks at Old         Bewick,        Doddington,
and    Roughting Linn, as well as to inspect                   the    excavations      of
the   British forts, dwellings, and sepulchres                  on    Yevering Bell,
among the      Cheviot      Hills.    On one of these occasions, he joined              a
meeting    of the Berwickshire          Naturalists' Club — of         which club he
       a member;       but not being        able    to keep up with the party,
walking through          long wet brackens, and over rough moorland, he
borrowed a horse.           Not being    a good rider, he soon         came     to grief,
in a bog     which     had     to be crossed.        The horse finding himself
sinking,    reared, and tumbled          the Professor       into the mud, out of
which he was extricated, with some difficulty, and to the no small
detriment      of garments. After getting through the bog,                 he  valiantly
 mounted again, glad to have             that method of reaching the top of
one   of the highest of the Cheviots.
     One of the archaeological topics on which Professor Simpson wrote
 an interesting paper, was a history of the Oratory on the island of
 Inchcolm.       I understand      that he had collected materials for a simi
 lar account of     all the islands of the Firth of Forth — on                   most of
 which there      are   still traces of ancient ecclesiastical edifices.                I
 know also, that he had begun to write an account of the Roman
  Wall, extending      between the      Firths of Forth     and Clyde, as he once
  spoke to me on      the subject, wishing          to  know     my opinion of        Mr
  (xeikie's theory,     that this district of Scotland            had    risen twenty
  or  thirty  feet out of the sea, since the wall was              erected.      It is to
  be  hoped that    if his MSS.       on   these    subjects are found, they will
  be  put into a proper form for publication.
     Animal     Magnetism,       Mesmerism,        and Biology,        were    subjects,
  which at an early period, he studied           ;   and for  a  time he was much
  impressed with the phenomena            : — so much     so indeed, that he used
  to  hold "seances"         in his own house, and show that he himself
  possessed a certain         strange power over others.             I  have    heard  of
  his even     performing in        the   houses     of his friends,        at  evening
  parties, —  when selecting        some    one,    whom   by a mere         glance he
  discovered to be particularly nervous or
                                                       sensitive,      he would show

 262                  Proceedings          of the Royal Society
how completely a strung will could so influence the mind of another,
as to cause confusion             of ideas almost amounting to               imbecility.
    This meddling with mesmerism brought the Professor into some
disrepute ; and he was severely attacked in the Medical Journals,
for his supposed           credulity.       At first,      he    took no notice of these
attacks    ;  but in consequence of the solicitation of his friends                           he
in September 1851, published a                                                  "
                                                 letter in the " Lancet explaining
the object of his miscalled " mesmeric soirees."                            In that letter    he
says—
   " During the last ten or fifteen years, I have repeatedly seen experiments,
and also made them myself. In the course of them I have witnessed very
interesting physiological and psychological results, snch as the production of
deep sleep, fixture and rigidity of muscles, &c.                 Bnt I have no belief what
ever, that these      phenomena are the effects of any power, force, or agency
                                                         magnetism' — passing from the so-
                                             ' animal
such as   is understood       by the term
        '               '                          '
called mesmeriser            to  the  so-called      mesmerised.'        They are merely the
                                                1                 '
effects produced     by the mind of the           mesmerised         upon his or her own    eco
nomy ; — self-mental        acts so to speak.        These may no doubt be produced by
the influence of the will of one individual acting on another.                       But they
are no proof of any magnetic, mesmeric, or other supposed agency.                      In proof
of my utter disbelief in clairvoyance, I may state that having sometime ago
been present at a lecture on the subject,                I offered to place L.100 in the
hands of the President of the Medico-Chirurgical                     Society which he was tn
give to the lecturer,     if  the latter would bring any clairvoyant, who could read
a line of Shakespeare,        or two or three        words   out of a dictionary,    which    he
(Professor 8impson) would shut up in a box."
    Professor Simpson had no patience for the quackery and credulity
of spirit rapping             and as Faraday condescended to expose                     " table
                          ;
turning" by         a written        opinion      which     he      sent to the    "Times"
newspaper,      so in like        manner Professor           Simpson took occasion,           in
the course of his address to the Society                   of Antiquaries,      to remark —
   " In our own days many sane persons profess to believe in the
                                                                                  possibility of
summoning the spirits of the departed from the other world back to this sub
lunary sphere.       When they do so they have always hitherto, as far as I have
heard, encouraged      these spirits to perform such            silly, juggling tricks, or re
quested them to answer such trivial            and frivolous questions as would, to my
humble apprehension, seem to be almost insulting to the grim dignity and
solemn character of any respectable               ghost.    If, like Mr Home, I had the
power to call spirits from the vasty deep, and             if  the spirits answered    the call,
I, being   a practical man, would fain make a practical use                 of their presence.
Methinks,     I should next ask them hosts of questions regarding the state
of society,   religion,     the arts, &c., at the time when they themselves were

                         of Edinburgh,          Session    1870-71.                     263
 living   denizens of this earth.           Suppose   that our Secretaries,    in summon
 ing the next       meeting of this Society, had the power of announcing in
their billets that a very select deputation of ancient Britons and Caledonians,
 Picts, Celts, Scots, and perhaps of Scottish Juranians, were to be present in
our Museum for a short sederunt between midnight and cock-crowing to an
swer any questions which the Fellows might choose to ply them with, what
an excitement       would such an announcement create ! What a battery of quick
questions would be levelled at the members of this deputation on all the end-
lssj problems of Scotch
                                archaeology."
     About      the same time Professor                 Simpson      took    part   in   the
discussions        which agitated          the   medical world        on the    subject of
Homoeopathy.             At   a meeting of the       Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical
Society, the        following motion          was   made    by Professor       Syme, and
seconded by Professor Simpson :— " That the public profession of
 Homoeopathy shall be held to disqualify for being admitted, or re
 maining        a member of the Society."                   Professor      Simpson      sup
 ported      this motion by         a   very able     address,    which he afterwards
 expanded         into a     book.     This,    as well as the      reply to it by Pro
 fessor     Henderson, shows            an   immense extent of reading and in
  formation.
     Another        subject which          deeply    engaged      Professor     Simpson's
  attention      was the so-called Bathgate coal, and                 also  the shales of
  the   Scotch coal fields,         on   account of the petroleum             which    they
  yielded by proper treatment.                 I have seen     the outer lobby of his
  house      in Queen Street greatly obstructed with huge specimens
  of the various         kinds, and occasionally          he spoke     to me regarding
   them    ;   not     so   much     in   their    geological    relations as in their
   mercantile value and uses.                 It  is matter     of notoriety that Pro
   fessor     Simpson       joined    one     or more of        the   companies      which
   were formed          for the purpose of extracting             oil from    these    beds,
   and    it is understood that          he suffered      considerable losses in con
   sequence.
       The number and variety of topics which thus engaged                       Simpson's
    attention — professional, scientific, literary,              and    speculative   — im
    plied    an   activity of mind,         a grasp    of intellect, and       a strength
    of constitution        truly marvellous.         His inquisitiveness        on   almost
    all subjects was incessant.               " Anything      new    turned up in Ber

    probably to       hear of more Picts' houses discovered, or more relics

found at the old Broch on Cockburn Law.                       His greatest delight
and recreation was to explore ancient ruins, caves, and encamp
ments      ;  to decipher inscriptions or sculptures on standing stones               or
rocks    ;   and to explore the rubbish of antiquated chronicles or musty
parchments.             Legends, superstitions,      and charm stones        were not
beneath         his    notice, and were carefully        studied, in the hope         of
extracting          from them some gleam of historical            truth.     As   a  ray
of sunlight enters a prism colourless and comes out radiant with
beauty, — so these old inscriptions, sculpturings, and legends, after
passing through Simpson's scrutiny, often appeared in a new                       light,
and gave out a meaning not before suspected.*
     His memory           was    surprising.     Notwithstanding the legions of
 books which he            read, — notwithstanding      the numbers of places he
 visited, and the multitudes of facts which he gathered up at these
 visits, — he made no notes, and kept no diary, as most persons have
 to do.        Any information         obtained, whether from his own obser
 vation or from other persons; or any new views expressed                      on   sub
jects which interested him, he seldom forgot                  ; and   could at once
 reproduce or refer to, when necessary.
     Professor Simpson, engaged as he was in the teaching of youth,
 and    attentive        to subjects of public interest, could scarcely avoid
 taking      some part in the educational discussions which have occurred
 during       the last ten or twelve years in Scotland.               The points      he
 chiefly urged for improving               public instruction    were peculiar, and
 gave surprise to many             of his friends.    As President of     the Granton
 Literary Association, he, in November 1867, delivered an address
 or lecture, which was published, i: on the necessity               of  some change
 in the mode             and object     of education in schools,      in   reference   to
 modern and ancient languages."                 In this lecture the following pithy
  sentences        occur : —
     " Should      they teach the modern languages, that are throbbing with life and
  activity   ?   or should they teach the old languages of Greece and Rome spoken
  2000 years ago ?
     " Was it right that one-seventh of a man's life should be spent in the
  acquisition of these dead languages ? For the clerical profession, he admitted
     * As examples,        see Simpson's paper on " The Cat-etane ; Is  it not the Tomb
                                                          " Also to his paper "
  stone   of   the   Grandfather of Hengist and Bona f                                On
  Ancient Sculpturings of Cups and Concentric Rings in Scotland."

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                                  265
this was    a necessary  study.     But it was no longer necessary     for the mass of
the people.
    " It was said that Latin and Greek were the best training.        This he thought
 a  great error; for the faculty called into exercise was chiefly memory.              The
 power of observation required       in science   and art was called little into play,
and the reasoning power of the mind became stunted and deformed                ; — to such
a degree,    indeed, that the students were ignorant even of their own ignor
ance."
     In like manner, in his address to the Society of Antiquaries, he
 took the opportunity of undervaluing classical education, by such
 declarations as these        : —
     " Archaiology has gained for us a clearer and nearer insight into
                                                                               every-day
 Roman life and habits, than all that classic literature supplies.          Archaeology,
 by its study of the old works of art belonging to Greece, has shown                that a
 livelier and more familiar knowledge of that classic land is to be derived
 from the contemplation of its remaining statues, sculptures, gems, models,
 and coins, than by any amount of school-grinding           at Greek words and Greek
 quantities."
     It  is the more    surprising that such views           as these     should have
 been     put forth, considering         the frequent     and   good    use to which
 Professor Simpson put his own classical information.                    In his    papers
       " Roman Medical Stamps," and " Was the Roman Army
 on                                                                                   pro

 vided with Medical Officers f             he was able to give information, not
 only interesting,      but instructive and useful, both papers displaying
 an    extensive and intimate acquaintance with Greek and Roman
 authors.       In his work       on Anaesthetics, he devotes       two chapters to
 obviate     the theological       objections taken to their employment                  to
 lessen the pains       of child-bearing,         and in these chapters discusses
 the true meaning of the Hebrew text                of certain scriptural      passages.
      I   have hitherto         spoken of Simpson          chiefly   as    regards      his
 professional knowledge and his varied scientific and intellectual
 attainments.        But it would be wrong in me to pass over unnoticed
 other     features of his life and character quite as remarkable.                      He
  was a man      of strong emotions.           It  of  course depended       on the ex
  citing cause,      how these        influenced     him.      When attacked pro
  fessionally or otherwise ; — or when, after             he had set his heart and
  hand to the attainment of some object, he found himself opposed,
  he was like a war-horse in a battle-field.                 His impetuosity some
  times carried      him    too far,    brought     him upon     dangerous ground,
  and    caused    him    to resort     to means      for accomplishing          his ends

 266                  Proceedings       of the Royal Society
which     he  himself afterwards           regretted.    He hit his opponents
 severely, and     I   think  even in this room       expressions dropped from
 him which, in a scientific         discussion, were out of place.         But    he
 was not     of an    unforgiving temper. I myself know, that he could
 offer the hand of reconcilement, after a contest was over.                  I  saw
 the other day in a medical           newspaper*      a statement that not     long
 before his death, he sent letters to some of his professional brethren
 whom he thought he might               have hurt in the heat of controversy,
 expressing regret and asking forgiveness.                Being curious to know
 whether this was really the case,            I applied to one of the medical
 gentlemen who attended            him during      his last illness, and he      in
 formed me that he did not know of any letters to that effect                ;  but
 he   knew of   a message     having been sent to one professional gentle
 man, then also unwell, with whom there had                  been  bitter contro
versy and long estrangement, — and the result was complete recon
ciliation.
    I  have already alluded to the multitudes             of patients who every
day thronged his house.            The poor always could rely on getting
advice from him gratuitously.               But he was never very exacting
from any class      ;   and when persons in a better rank of life, who had
come     for advice, were discovered by him to be in greatly embar
rassed    circumstances,       he   is known      to   have generously     helped
them.
    Two examples of this generosity may                 be mentioned.     A lady
whom he had attended was recommended by him, for the cure of
her ailment, to go to       a  certain watering-place.        Tendering to him
such a fee as she was able to give, and for the smallness of which
she apologised,        the  lady mentioned that the expense of going
there would put it beyond her power.               Simpson said nothing at the
time, hut afterwards in the most delicate way returned the fee, and
enclosed £20 to enable          her to obtain the means of cure which he
had recommended.            The other case was the wife of a New York
merchant who had come to Scotland to be under his care.                   Whilst
here, her husband died, and            in bankrupt circumstances.         Shortly
after this, intelligence reached her that her only son, whom she had
left at New York, was         ill with   a  dangerous fever.     She resolved     at
once    to return     home,    though she was to have remained             longer
                * Medical Times and Gazette,        14th May 1870.

                      of Edinburgh,       Session 1870-71.                   267
 under the    Professor's care. She was obliged to explain to him the
 cause   of her abrupt departure, and to ask him to wait for payment
 of his services      till  she returned     home.     He not only intimated
 to her    that he would accept no fee, but gave her in a present
enough to pay her passage to New York.
    His kindness was not confined to his patients. From persons
who were        entire strangers to him, and who were merely passing
through Edinburgh, hospitality was never withheld.                 His breakfast
and luncheon table was often crowded by foreigners, who, knowing
the   Professor no otherwise than by his world-wide reputation, and
being told that he was extremely accessible, used to send in their
cards, and received from him a cordial welcome.
    Professor Simpson, in the spirit of true philanthropy, took much
interest in the welfare of that wretched part of the population of
 Edinburgh occupying cellars, and frequenting haunts of vice in
the   Old Town.        Many a time did he visit them at night, after his
day duties were over.             Moreover, he tried to interest others in
 their behalf, forming for that purpose, at his own house, parties of
 gentlemen and even ladies to accompany him.                 But the practice
 gave offence, and was discontinued.
     Professor Simpson was imbued with strong religious feelings.
  Most persons here will probably remember how, in narrating the
  conversation which he had with Sir David Brewster on his death
  bed, he was evidently        pleased  to be able to testify to the Christian
  faith of the dying philosopher.           Simpson both lived and died a
  Christian   ;  not only holding fast his trust in the Saviour, but desir
  ing to impart the same comfort to others.             His name may there
  fore  well be added to those       of Faraday and Brewster, who in our
  own day have shown that the            highest attainments     in philosophy
  and science, are not incompatible         with strong religious feeling and
  the sincere faith of a Christian.
     Professor Simpson was so remarkable in his outward appearance
  and expression, that any one, even happening to meet him in the
  street, could not    fail   to take special notice   of him.    Though short
  in stature, he had large features, and         a shaggy head      of unkempt
  hair.    His   eye was piercing, and his      lips expressive.    The energy
  of his physical constitution       was wonderful, and he taxed     it severely.
  Thus, after going to Oxford, to receive            a  University distinction,

268                    Proceedings         of the Royal Society
he    started     next     morning         with    two    friends    for      Devizes,        from
whence he went on to Avebury to see                       " the standing stones,"              not
getting       back    till midnight.                              five
                                              On the following morning                   at
o'clock, he       started for Stonehenge, and the same afternoon went
to Bath to        visit the Roman remains in that neighbourhood.   On
getting back at midnight, he found a telegram summoning him                                     to
a patient       in Northumberland.                He lay down for          a few       hours    to
sleep, and then went by the 4 a.m. train to London, and caught                                 the
Scotch " Express," which                   took him       to   Northumberland,                from
which place he went on to Edinburgh to resume                                 his usual pro
fessional work.
     What constitution         could stand          such incessant wear and tear                  ?
A    severe     attack of rheumatism               followed    the   fatiguing journeys
I   have   been      describing,     and    this complaint          continued frequently
to torture       him during the last two years of his life.                       Eventually
the action of the heart became impaired, and angina pectoris super
vened, — causing occasionally intense agony.
     The fatigue and cold endured last February,                       in journeys made
to London         on the occasion of Lady                  Mordaunt's         trial,   brought
on the     illness which proved fatal.                For two months             he was con
fined to the house, and chiefly                   to bed, though      even      then he was
able to write a letter on the subject           of chloroform for publication
in an American             Medical     Journal, the object of which was to
refute some one who, in the previous number, had been endeavour
ing to dispute that he was the first to apply chloroform to                               anaes
thetic purposes.
 My sketch of Simpson's life, imperfect as it     would be still        is,
more so, were   to omit notice of the distinctions which were
                       1
showered        upon him from almost every quarter of the globe.                               I
cannot recount all the Academies, Universities, and Societies which
bestowed        their honours upon him.                  There was not one nation in
Europe from which these honours did not come, and America joined
in the general acclaim.               Simpson was created             a    baronet of the
United Kingdom. He received the knighthood of the Swedish
Royal Order of St Olaf. He was made       laureate of the Imperial
                                                           a

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                                 2G9
     Gratifying      to Simpson as these           honours and        distinctions       no
douht      were, there was one fact which            must have        been even more
gratifying, and that was the introduction of chloroform, for medical
purposes,      in every civilized      country, coupled with the almost uni
versal acknowledgment            that he had been the first to suggest and
employ      it for the relief of human suffering.            He must      also have felt
that the world         generally accorded to him the highest eminence in
his profession, inasmuch           as patients had come           to him from every
quarter      of the globe,     and   as his works had been             translated into
every European          language.     Probably no man ever lived who, at the
close    of life, had   the satisfaction    of looking back     on the same amount
of work done for the benefit of his fellow creatures,                  and   of   possess
ing so largely their approbation and confidence.
      In  these circumstances,      it  is not surprising      that, at the sugges
 tion of the most eminent           of the medical faculty            in London, and
 warmly seconded by men there               of high social position,          a   proposal
 was made,       soon after Simpson's death           had    been    announced, that
 Iiia   remains should      Le interred      in Westminster        Abbey, — that last
  resting-place      of Britain's most illustrious      sons.       But the proposal
  waa    modestly, and     I think  properly declined by the surviving mem
  bers   of his family.      Their decision       was in this respect           in accord
  with the unostentatious character and habits of the deceased.                           It
  waa    right and becoming that a man of his domestic dispositions
  should not be separated, even after death,              from the other members
  of his own       family,   to whom he was deeply attached, but that he
  should lie beside them in the spot which he himself                      had selected,
   and where      several had already been buried.               Moreover, his inter
   ment at home allowed         of  an honour being conferred on him at his
   funeral, which, to my mind, was             far greater than entombment in
   Westminster Abbey; — for his funeral                was     attended       by all    the
   public bodies and corporations of Edinburgh,                and was thronged by
   thousands      of sorrowing mourners,         who, even from distant parts of
    the country,    came to pay the last tribute       of   respect to one who had
   been so    great a benefactor of the human race.
       We have      all to lament that our         deceased     friend and associate
    should   have been cut off in the meridian             of his    fame, and whilst
    still running a career       of usefulness.       But we have reason              to be
     thankful   that his life, short       if  reckoned by years,          was     long,   if

270                 Proceedings of     the Royal Society
reckoned by good deeds and great services,            not the least of     wbich
was the example he bequeathed            of  a man     devoted to noble      pur
suits, characterised by incessant industry, imbued with             benevolent
dispositions,    animated by Christian       faith.    In the letter     already
referred to, written on his death-bed, for the American Jouraal,
he concluded      it  by saying,  that he regarded the friendship of          his
medical brethren in America so highly, that he would not think
th is last effort at professional writing, altogether useless,     if it  tended
to fix his memory in their love and esteem.         It  was to friends   abroad,
that this appeal      was made.     To friends    at home,    no such appeal
was required.       He knew that he had accomplished, what would for
ever fix his memory in their love and esteem.             To that   sentiment,
sure   I am that his own      countrymen     and countrywomen cordially
respond    ; and   not less sure am   I  that the Fellows of this Society
will  ever remember with respect the eminent and diversified talents,
as well as the signal services to science and            humanity,     of their
distinguished associate.
   James Syme was born 7th November 1799, and died 26th June
1870.     Up to within a year of his death, he was Professor of Clinical
Surgery in the University of Edinburgh, which chair he had held
for thirty-six years.      His father had originally followed the pro
fession of a Writer to the Signet, but had retired at an early period
with his family to the estate       of Gartmore and Lochore            in Fife.
It  is understood that, in      consequence of there being no public
school in the country which he could conveniently attend,             Mr    Syme
obtained a tutor for his son whilst resident in Fife, so that he              had
in his early days no opportunity of associating with other boys, —
a circumstance       which may perhaps account for his shy and                 re
served manner in after life.       Whilst   a  boy, it is said that he indi
cated    a taste  for anatomy, by frequently resorting         to a butcher's
shop,    where he watched with        interest the cutting up of            sheep
and oxen.       His father at length seeing the necessity of giving
to his son a better education and          training than he was receiving
in the country, sent him to Edinburgh to attend the High School.
Afterwards, at the age of sixteen, he passed to the College, and
became     much interested in chemistry.         When he returned during
the holidays     to  Fife, he generally brought       with him a supply          of

                      of Edinburgh,    Session 1870-71.                271
 apparatus   — purchased     with his own pocket-money    — to enable him
 to  carry on chemical experiments for his amusement.
    So   early as the year 1818 he had discovered a solvent for
 caoutchouc in the naphtha obtained by distillation from coal-tar,
and in March of that year addressed a letter describing his discovery
to Dr Thomson, then editor of the " Annals of Philosophy," which
appeared     in that publication in August following.    Mr Syme in this
letter  states that " he had, by means of the     discovery, waterproofed
a  silk cloak, so that it afforded complete protection from the heaviest
rain, and could be employed as a pitcher by turning up its skirt."
He adds that he had " constructed flexible tubes of the same sub
stance."      It  appears that be bad worked at this subject for two
years before     the discovery. The discovery was deemed so important,
that Dr Thomson and some of his friends recommended young
Syme to take out a patent, assuring him that it would make his
fortune.      But    by this time he had determined on following the
medical profession,      which he thought more respectable than that of
a  manufacturer.        He therefore contented himself with publishing
his discovery,     and receiving   general commendation     for his disin
terestedness.       Not long afterwards the discovery was turned to
good    account, as we all know, by Mr Macintosh of Glasgow, who
 made    a large fortune by means of it, and who gave his name to the
 cloth,  though in reality invented by Syme.
    Syme became a pupil of Dr Barclay in order to study anatomy ;
 and in 1818 he went into Liston's dissecting-rooms, as his assistant.
 He was a distant cousin of Liston's.
    In 1820    he obtained the appointment    of Medical Superintendent
 of the Fever Hospital,     —an   appointment entailing much personal
 risk,  as  Mr Syme     soon  discovered ; for he caught   the infection,
 and   nearly died.
     In 1821   he became one    of the dressers in the Edinburgh Royal
  Infirmary.     As such, it was his duty to carry out the instructions
 of the acting surgeon. In this position he showed the possession of
 considerable courage and self-reliance, by disobeying some instruc
 tions   which    his judgment    condemned.     The system of blood
  letting was then in full operation, and every evening at a certain
  hour, the dressers had to bleed the patients        whose names were
  entered in a book, and take from each        the number of ounces     of
    vol.  ni.                                                   2 N

272               Proceedings      of the Royal Society
 blood  there specified.    On one occasion          Syme had to take from a
 patient in one of his wards so much as 65 ounces, to be followed
 next day by other 35 ounces.           Another patient       was a boy, one      of
 whose   legs had  a compound fracture, which gave rise to profuse
suppuration.    About three weeks after the injury, the boy's strength
being much exhausted, Syme took it upon him to order porter and
a  beef-steak.    Next day   the    acting surgeon, then one of the most
largely employed medical men in Edinburgh, expressed disapproval
 of this regime, as he said     it would     feed     the disease,    and directed
Syme to take 14 ounces of blood from the boy's arm.                  Syme obeyed
 with reluctance, and not without remonstrating.                 Before the end
of forty-eight hours, the boy was dead.
    In  1821  Syme was elected a member of the Royal College of
 Surgeons of London,       and    in   1823    a    Fellow of     the   Edinburgh
 College of Surgeons.      About      the   same     time he went abroad          to
Germany      and France,    visiting different hospitals, and forming
useful acquaintances.      He also entered into a sort of partnership
with   Mr Liston,  and occasionally took       Liston's     place in the lecture-
room.    This partnership, however, did not continue long. A quarrel
occurred, which caused an estrangement of many years' duration.
    But Syme, notwithstanding        that he thereby lost an advantageous
position,   was not discouraged.        He entered into another partner
ship with     Dr Macintosh     (who then lectured on midwifery and
the practice of medicine), for the purpose of establishing a new
medical school, with an anatomical theatre, dissecting-rooms,                  and
museums, — he himself intending to lecture               on anatomy and sur
gery.     The   very  boldness     of the undertaking            arrested   public
attention.    The school, however, failed        ;   but Syme himself, fortu
nately by zeal,    talent, and     complete        knowledge      of his subject,
coupled with an indication         of views which         were    innovations   on
established practice, soon attracted a large number of students.
His chief difficulty   arose  from the scarcity of subjects for dissec
                                        " Resurrection-men," as
tion, except by dealing with the                                         they were
profanely called, — a course       which    Syme detested.            In order   to
pursue his anatomical researches,        he took advantage         of the holidays
to go over to Dublin.       When       there, he made        acquaintance with
several   eminent surgeons, and was so delighted with their modes
of operation — which he thought superior to those of Edinburgh —

                         of Edinburgh,         Session     1870-71.                   273
that he resolved to abandcn anatomy, and confine bis teachings to
surgery.
      In   1820   he bad as many as 250 pupils attending his surgical
lectures,     a success the more remarkable, considering                  that Liston,
Lizars, and Turner, were rival lecturers.                   This well-attended       class
he kept up        for  several   years.
      Syme had been most anxious to get on the surgical staff of the
Royal Infirmary.               But Liston was one of the surgeons             ;  and the
managers        knowing       the animosity which existed between               him and
Mr Syme, felt that            by admitting       both   into their  institution,    there
would be       every probability of dispeace.              They refused Syme's         ap
plication.       He therefore resolved to set up a rival institution,                  and
 took XI into House,          with    15 rooms in it.       These he converted into
 wards.       He also      formed     an out-patient       department.     This    was a
 still bolder exploit than any before                  ventured on, but it was          re
 warded       with complete         success.      On    the  very first day that the
 new      hospital was opened several patients sought admission, and in
 the next two days as many as ten young medical men applied for
 the house       surgeoncy,       though £100 was required as a fee.                  The
 report for the        first year tells of 265 in-door cases, 1900 out-door
 cases, and 95 operations.               For four    years this new institution        was
 carried on,     with unvarying success, vieing with the old established
  Royal Infirmary in the number and importance of its operations,
  and presenting a striking proof of what could be done by one
  young man, not only unsupported by local influence, but overcom
  ing local and social influence                arrayed against him,        by dint of
  indomitable zeal, natural talents, and great professional knowledge.
       Syme's, seminary        for instruction        in Clinical Surgery,       was    re
  cognised by the College           of Surgeons in London, as qualified to give
   instruction for medical students. The Edinburgh College of Sur
   geons refused      to recognise the new hospital, but agreed to recognise
    a  course   of lectures     on   Clinical Surgery, if Syme          chose    to give
    them, on the condition,          however,     that the pupik attending         these
    lectures did not exceed         40 in number, and that they paid the same
    fees as were    received by Mr Russell, the Professor of Clinical Sur
     gery in the    University.        To   these    terms   Syme acceded; and by
     his xdmirable     lectures      soon    laid the     foundation   of subsequent
     brilliant reputation as      a  clinical teacher.

274                  Proceedings of     the   Royal Society
    It   was   during    this period, when       he was an extra-academical
lecturer, that he published two books, one " A Treatise on Excision
of Diseased        Joints;"     the other    "The Principles of Surgery."
These books, which embraced            numerous cases of successful opera
tions by the author, — many of them indicating new and improved
practices, extended Syme's fame over Europe, and paved the way
for another distinction.          This was his appointment to the        Chair of
Clinical Surgery       in the University of Edinburgh, which Mr Russell
(now in his 83d year) resigned. It was obtained in spite of the
opposition of his former master and jealous rival, Liston, who
wished it for himself, but would not accede to the conditions                 re
quired by the Patron, the Crown, that            Mr Russell should have from
 h is successor £300 a year        of retiring pension.      Mr Liston had, up
to this time, succeeded          in shutting    Syme out from access to the
 Infirmary.       That exclusion,      however, the      managers     saw  could
scarcely     be continued after Syme had become              Clinical Professor
in the University.         It  was a fortunate event for both parties that,
about this time, an invitation came to Liston to remove to London
to become Professor         of Clinical Surgery in University College, an
invitation which         he   gladly  accepted.      Shortly   after this event
Liston wrote       to Syme expressing       a wish to be reconciled — a wish
to which the latter readily acceded.
     Liston died    in 1847, and Syme was then invited to succeed            him
as Clinical Professor in University College, London.                   Syme felt
flattered by the proposal,        and was pleased     at the prospect of going
to    a  capital where private practice would         be far greater and more
remunerative.         He   was,   however, exchanging        a certainty for an
uncertainty.        He had L.700 a-year from his           class in  Edinburgh,
and     full employment        as consulting    surgeon, whereas all that was
offered to be ensured to him in London was a fixed salary               of L.150
independently of class fees.          Nevertheless he resolved on throwing
up his position in Edinburgh,           where    he commanded both respect
and emoluments, and in February 1848 repaired to London.                      He
soon     found that he had taken a wrong step.                His class was less
numerous, and though his practice might eventually become great,
 he felt that    it would    be long before    that pecuniary advantage was
 arrived at, and perhaps still longer before he could attain the social
 position which he held in Edinburgh.              His manner    was also rather

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                                            27.1
reserved       for acceptance in London society.                            Hence, though he was
making rapid progress in surgical practice, he soon began                                       to wish
he had never              left Scotland.           It        was when in this mood              that he
received a request from the council                            of the Landon           University to
deliver        lectures      on      systematic          as    well    as    on    clinical surgery.
Thereupon            he    at once      sent in his resignation.                     In fact,      before
leaving Edinburgh                 he had     stipulated that be should be exempted
from      this additional            duty.      The month of                July   1848 found        him
back again in Edinburgh, after only a four months' stay in London,
during which time, however, he had succeeded in acquiring the
entire confidence and esteem of the medical students ; insomuch
that, when they heard of his intention to leave them, a committee
of their number waited upon him, beseeching him                                      to remain, and
saying that an aiiiress was about to                           be presented, signed by every
individual student. But he declined                            the entreaty, flattering though
it was.        He felt      he had made            a mistake when he left                  Edinburgh,
and he was resolved to correct                          it   before   it    was too late.      Fortu
nately for Syine,              the    Chair of Clinical Surgery in                   the    Edinburgh
University, vacated by his going to London, had not been filled up.
He was again appointed to                    it,
                               and his return to the scene of his
former         success      was greeted            by        general acclamation            alike from
students and old friends.
     In   subsequent years Professor                         Syme, besides teaching his class
and attending              the Infirmary, took part                     in the proceedings ot
various medical and scientific                      societies.         He became President of
the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Society in 1848.                                          He had pre
viously become             a    Fellow of       our own          Society,         and communicated
to   it   a   very important discovery, that the formation of bone                                 is   due
to the Periosteum —               a   discovery which was the subject of                      a     paper
published in our Transactions.                          The importance of this discovery
is   great, as       it    often renders amputation                    of    a    limb unnecessary,
in the        case   of   diseased     bones,   if       the disease be not in the perios
teum.
     At a later period, Mr Syme's active mind led him                                  to pay atten
tion to subjects of more general interest connected with the medical
profession.           In the year        1854 he took up the question                       of medical
reform, and addressed                   a    letter          to Lord       Palmerston        and    Lord
Elcho,        recommending             the   appointment              of    a    General Council         to

276                  Proceedings      of the Royal Society
pass regulations for the granting          of medical licenses in the United
Kingdom.        He continued for several years to take p art in the
public discussion of this question.             His views    were very  generally
approved     of,   and,   I   believe, formed the basis         of much of the
Legislation which       has since taken place.
   Another     subject of much         local   interest   in Edinburgh, which
engaged    Professor Syme's attention, was the best site for a new
Infirmary.       At first   he advocated   the old site    ; but, on farther con
sideration,    he confessed       he  was    in error, and ultimately       ener
getically assisted those who wished the new hospital to.be built in
the suburbs      of the town, where purer air for the patients would be
secured.
   During    the winter of 1868-9         Mr Syme's health        was not what   it
had   been.      He was less able for the fatigues of lecturing.               He
was also much harassed          by the frequent meetings he had to attend
about the new Infirmary, and he was greatly annoyed and irritated
by a disagreeable professional controversy in which he                    was  in
volved.     The spring of 1869 also brought heav} domestic afflic
tion.     On the 6th April, after performing an operation in the
Infirmary,    he had     a bad    attack of paralysis, which, however, left
his mind unclouded.           He so far recovered        that he was able once
or twice to walk      from his villa of Millbank to see patients in his
consulting     rooms    in Edinburgh,      and     even  to give advice in the
Infirmary    as a   consulting surgeon.         He resigned his chair in July
1869.     In  the   spring of 1870 he         still continued to see patients,
but another worse attack of paralysis occurred in May, and he died
on the 26th       of June.      He was interred in St John's Episcopal
Church, of which he had long been a member, followed to the grave
by very many of his old friends and pupils.
   I  will of   course   not attempt any account of the services ren
dered by Professor Syme to the special branch of the medical art
to which he attached himself.             All authorities concur in saying
that, in virtue of the many important discoveries made by him, his
skill  as  an    operator, his diagnostic          sagacity,  and   his accurate
teaching, he was the greatest surgeon of his time.                   His services
were   twofold.       He abolished, or assisted         to abolish, many      bad
practices in surgery, and he was the means of introducing many
new practices which have been generally adopted.                     Among this

amputations,             and   substituting          excision       instead, whereby many a
person      now retains            an arm          or a leg, which         surgeons previously
had been      in the habit of cutting off.                     The like    good effect followed
from    his discovery, that the formation of bone was due to the perios
teum.     His treatment of aneurisms was very successful. He had
an    almost instinctive faculty in discerning the true character of
tumours,      of which             one     example, not         generally       known,     may    be
mentioned.           A     Scotch nobleman was suffering from polypus in the
nose.       He had consulted the most eminent surgeons in Paris                                  and
London.        In        both of these capitals he received the same opinion,
that the     tumour being of the malignant type, it could not be ex
tracted     with any probability of saving life. Some of this nobleman's
friends suggested a visit to Edinburgh,                         to obtain Professor Syme's
opinion.      He accordingly came here, and a consultation took place.
Mr Syme        thought the tumour not malignant, and he gave an
opinion     that it might be radically extirpated. The operation was
performed,         and with complete                success.        The nobleman alluded to
is   now   alive,        and in good health.
     Syme's manner was reserved and sometimes abrupt to his patients,
of which      the following               anecdote,        related to me the other day by            a
medical      friend,        is an        illustration.       A landed proprietor in Nor
thumberland              had been thrown              out    of his dog-cart,        and   was    so
severely      bruised that he feared                   his shoulder had been dislocated.
His medical attendant had a doubt about it.                               He therefore resolved
to go at     once to Edinburgh that Syme might                             see it.   At the hour
appointed          he called on Syme, and                    was shown into a room where
the     Professor         was standing             before    the fire.       As the gentleman
advanced,      Syme bowed stiffly, but did not speak.                            The gentleman,
who was       lame from gout, — as                 he hobbled into the room, by way of
beginning          conversation, intimated                   that    he   was    very gouty, on
which Syme said,
                               "   If   that 's all that 's the matter with you, you
need       not come to me;                 I   don't cure gout."          The gentleman next
said,
           " But     think my shoulder is dislocated, and I want you to
                     I
examine        it,   you will help me off with my coat."
                     if                                    Syme replied,
"I    need do                          —
                   nothing of the kind; your shoulder     not dislocated.       is
Take my word for that.                         I   don't need       to see   it."    The   decided
tone    in which           Syme spoke,             so impressed       the old gentleman that

278                 Proceedings     of the Ttoyal Society
he obeyed, and bid       Mr Syme    good morning, but not before        giving
him a double fee for his welcome            opinion.    He told his medical
man, when he returned home, that be thought              Mr Syme the most
self-possessed    man    he had met with, and      would assuredly go back
to him    if he ever had again to consult a surgeon.
    Syme was remarkable not only for self-possession, but for                the
more noble qualities of professional sincerity and honesty.              When
he found himself in the wrong, he never hesitated to alter his course,
nor was he ashamed to confess it.          When the late Sir David       Baird
of Newbyth was severely hurt by a kick from a horse in Berwick
shire, Dr Turnbull of Coldstream, who attended him, becoming
somewhat anxious, brought         Mr Syme out      to see him.      Mr Syme,
after inspecting the broken leg, and considering             the case, gave a
decided opinion that there was no reasonable           ground of apprehen
sion, and returned to      Edinburgh     the  same   day.    But that night
Sir David Baird       became   restless  and   feverish, and Dr Turnbull,
notwithstanding      Syme's opinion, on the following morning thought
of again sending for Syme.           Early that forenoon    he was surprised
to   see a carriage drive up to the door, and to find that Syme was in
it.    Dr Turnbull expressed his happiness          at seeing him so soon
again, but asked       what had brought him         back  ; on   which Syme
said,    "I  never closed my eyes last night, because        I  began   to fear
 1  had given you a wrong opinion, and           I have come     back   to see
your patient again."        Syme, after another examination,          satisfied
 himself that there was too good reason for anxiety, and intimated
that he thought Sir David Baird would not recover.               He died two
days afterwards.
    Syme, though he published very many papers                in the medical
journals, was not a voluminous writer.           As in his operations he got
through his work quickly, never drawing from his patient an un
necessary drop of blood, so in his publications he wrote concisely,
and seldom       wasted   a drop  of ink   on illustration.     His most im
                    " The   Principles of Surgery,"       went through five
portant work,
editions, the last edition being in bulk smaller than any of its pre
decessors.      His  aim, both in his books and in his lectures,       seemed
always to be, to give a maximum of instruction in a minimum of
words.
    Syme was proud of his profession, and proud of his own posi-

tion at the head          of it.    Perhaps it was from this cause that he
was charged         with unwillingness        to admit and adopt the improve
ments      suggested       by others in surgical         practice.     On     the other
Imnd,     he was     quite indifferent about pressing his claims to any
honorary distinction.            Nevertheless, from various public bodies, be
did receive, unasked for. acknowledgments of his merit                      ;  ns  when
there was       confened      the    M.D.    degree   from    the Universities          of
Dublin and         of Bonn, the D.C.L. degree from Oxford, and                        the
Knighthood          of the Dannebrog from the King of Denmark,                         an
honour      rarely     granted     to  a foreigner.       On   a  General Medical
Council for the United Kingdom                  being appointed, he was chosen
a member         of it,   to represent the      Universities of Edinburgh            and
At,erdeen.        For    ten years    he took a    lively interest    in its proceed
ings, and      his opinion was always listened to with respect.                   It was
probable      that Syme would            have   been    elected President         of the
 General    Medical Council on          the retirement of     Dr Burrows in        1869,
 but   Mr Syme alwut this time             became unwell, and his friends saw
 he  would    l2e  unable to fulfil the duties of the office.
     After Syme resigned his professorship in July 1869, a move
 ment among         his professional brethren, who knew his merits as a
 surgeon,     was commenced, for the purpose of raising a testimonial
 which    might keep his name before future generations.                      It  was all
 the  more striking and gratifying that this movement                     commenced
 in London,       and was warmly supported in America,                  because     indi
 cating the     judgment of       those who could estimate his services              free
 from the influence of local feelings.             The testimonial will embrace
 a  scholarship to bear Syme's name of L.100                a  year for students of
 surgery     in Edinburgh University, and a marble bust of Mr Syme
 for the great ball of the library.              The funds for      the testimonial
 have been nearly all subscribed.              Should there      be any deficiency,
  I  understand      it will be made       up by the University Endowment
  Association.
     Besides     testimonies from        abroad    to his professional         services,
  several   from     his countrymen        in Scotland,     of  a very     gratifying
  kind, were not wanting.              From    many provincial       associations of
  medical men, there came addresses expressing regret that be should
  have found      it necessary     to resign his professorship, and conveying

the Border Medical Association, dated at Kelso, on the l 8th            August
1869, ruus as follows:     —
   "At   the twenty-third  annual meeting of the Border Medical Association,
we, the undersigned     members,   unanimously resolved to ask you to receive
from us a short address on the occasion of your resignation of the Professor
ship of Clinical Surgery in the University of Edinburgh.
    " We desire to
                   convey to you our warmest thanks for the very kind manner
in which you have at all times discharged your duties towards our patients
and ourselves.     We beg also to thank you sincerely for innumerable acts of
personal kindness and attention. for which wo shall ever feel grateful.      Al
though the members of our profession generally have resolved to offer you
some testimonial in recognition of your inestimable services, and although
you have already received a most hearty expression      of sympathy and regard
from the profession practising in far distant lands, we trust that it will not
be otherwise than agreeable      to you to know that the medical and surgical
practitioners in your own Border-land are equally sensible of and grateful for
the great advantages they have derived from your precepts and example.         It
was with unmingled feelings of sorrow and regret that we heard of your ill
ness, and we now most heartily rejoice to know that you have so far recovered
as to be able, in some degree, to resume those professional duties which we
h i ve all learned to value so highly.    We desire to express the earnest hope
that you may yet bo long spared to give us the benefit of that eminent wisdom.
va«t knowledge. and matchless diagnostic tact and skill which have rendered
your name famous wherever the science and art of surgery are known.         It is
to us a source of pleasure that, on the very day of our assembling here, it has
become known that you are to be succeeded in your chair by your son-in-law,
Mr Lister, believing as we do that his appointment will be peculiarly grati
fying to yourself, in the highest degree acceptable to the profession nt home
and abroad, and highly calculated to maintain the celebrity of the Edinburgh
surgical school, in which you have so long been the distinguished master."
    If  there was any taste or pursuit beyond that of his own special
profession    for which Mr Syme had a predilection, it was gardening.
He long cultivated with great success the rarest plants of distant
temperate      and tropical    countries,    and   annually    carried off the
highest prizes at the exhibitions          of the Horticultural Society of
Scotland.      He was equally successful with tropical           fruits, among
others the banana, which he was one of the first in this country to
ripen in perfection.      In his later years,    at his  villa of Millbank,   he
formed a large collection of Orchids.          Among these he spent much
of his leisure hours.       To his friends and former pupils, when they
came     to see him, he was ever       ready to show kindness and hospi
tality;    and  the  friendships    which   he made      were lasting,   warm
hearted,    and disinterested.

   Perhaps the leading qualities                           of Syme's character,                   and     which
ensured          his success          in life, were clearness of perception, fearless
honesty          of purpose,         and      strength of will.             He     was      always able to
tee clearly the point at which                          to aim, and          by steadiness both of
eye    and        hand,     to reach           it,   in spite of obstacles                  and    difficulties
which        would         have      made       most     other men           flinch.           Self-reliance
was        his   chief stepping-stone                  to fame,      — the honourable                fame     of
having greatly advanced the science                                which tends          to save      life   and
limb, and also to assuage human suffering.
   III.    I      come now to the third head, which                          is    to    offer a few        iwj-
yestions     for increasing               the efficiency    of our Society.
   Under this head there are two points which demand attention.
   1st.      Can our present arrangements be improved                                   ?
   2d.      Are there any drawbacks which can be counteracted                                        ?
   (1.)      In regard          to our present arrangements                       for carrying           on the
Society's business, the most important                               is   undoubtedly the publica
tion of papers in our Proceedings                            and     Transactions.                Its import
ance       cannot well          be   over-estimated.               Probably but for this mode of
recording          discoveries, speculations, and inventions, and also of pub
lishing them, half of these                          would never have become                       known to
 the   world.         It   is   no disparagement to the papers which appear                                   in
our Proceedings ami Transactions                            to say        of them, that to only             one
 person      out of a thousand are they of any interest, and therefore
 that they would not be read, and would not pay to be published                                               by
 the authors         at their own expense.                         But next to           the      pleasure of
 effecting discovery, that of making known the discovery to others.
                                     is
 This last pleasure can therefore in many cases be obtained only
 through          means      of societies like             ours.     But there          is   another and       a
 separate         good      done     :     not only are investigators                    stimulated,         but
 when        the     results of their                investigations         become          widely known,
 these       often    suggest new views to other inquirers, who make use
 of these published                  results as stepping-stones for overcoming some
 difficulty         which       had obstructed               their    own         inquiries.          In that
 way,       also,    men        of    science        and literature          in    different        countries
 become          acquainted, so as to aid one another in their respective
  labours.
       1   have surely said enough to show how useful these publications

282                      1'ructadmys itf    the   Royal Socitty
are, and it is no small proof of this when we find, as                   I
                                                                      alreadyhave
stated, that our Transactions are            almost every year becoming more
bulky.
    The    only practical suggestion which                it occurs      to me to     offer
under this head            is,                                      early
                                 that means should be taken to ensure
publication.       I  am sorry to find that the volume containing last
year's papers       has not yet been published, though the Society's law
expressly states that
                      " the Transactions                  shall    be   published at the
close   of each Session."
   (2.) Another part of our proceedings to which                        I     respectfully
invite attention     the best mode of conducting
                          is                                                 our evening
meetings.         What     is    the object and use of these meetings             ?   From
a   paper published in the first volume of our Transactions, entitled,
" History   the Society," drawn up,
              of                                  1   believe,     by the first secre
tary, Dr Robison,        stated that              these    meetings were held in
                            it
                            is
order     that —

                   entertainment to members,
the Transactions.     Essays and cases are often read at tho meetings in order
to obtain the opinions of members on interesting or intricate subjects.  Some
papers intended for future publication have been withdrawn for the present
by their authors, in order to profit by what has occurred in the conversations
which the reading of the papers has suggested."
    The original         intention, therefore, of our evening meetings was
to encourage         discussion among the members                 on the papers       read,
and this object we have ever since kept in view, though on account
of the length and number of the papers put down to be read in one
evening, there has often been no time for any discussion of them.
I       suppose     it   had been     with the view of remedying this incon
venience that in October 1836 the Council of the Society made                            a
remit to the three secretaries          —
   " To report as to the possibility of economising time by some change in
the present order of the business of the general meetings, and by inducing
the authors of papers to give (when necessary) condensed abstracts of them,
leaving tho details for being printed when their publication in the Transac
tions may be determined on."

                         of Edinburgh,        Session 1870-71.                          283
     The three secretaries accordingly,              in December 1836,            reported
 how    this object might       be  brought about, viz., that
    "
       The members of Council to whom papers are referred for preliminary
 examination     shall, after perusal, advise with the authors in what manner they
 may be shortened      in reading them to the Society. The            secretaries    farther
submit, that some course       of this kind is imperiously called     for, by the increas
ing number        and value of the communications presented to the Society.
They    farther   express their conviction, that the change in question, if acted on
by authors, will add greatly to the spirit of the Society's meetings, and to the
interest of the members in its proceedings."
    They add in their report, " That the public                    business,       if time
enough be       left, should     be   concluded with verbal communications
of scientific      news."
    This report         was adopted and approved of by               t he   Council, and
ordered      to be printed, so that          I  have   no doubt     it  was communi
cated to     the Society generally, and attempted              to be carried out.
    Iu now therefore bespeaking                renewed    attention to this subject.
1   only desire        to  urge what seems         to   have   been     alike intended
by    the founders        of the Society, and aimed           at by those who have
preceded us in the Society's management.
    The advantages of a good attendance of members                         at our meet
ings,     and     also of   a  discussion of the papers          read at them, are
obvious.          It  is for the credit of the Society, that its members
should      take an interest in its objects, and show that interest by
attending        its meetings.       It  is an encouragement to literary and
scientific authors to bring forward papers,                  when they know that
these     will   be read,    not to dead benches,         but to living associates,
and to associates         who  will listen, and     some of whom        will  state, after
hearing the papers, whether they appreciate the views contained in
them.        It  is also an advantage to members            to have an opportunity
of meeting         one    another, for the purpose          of cultivating friendly
intercourse, and obtaining information.
    In the Geological Society of London — the only Society there,
whose meetings I have had an opportunity of attending — special
means are taken to induce a good attendance, and also to induce
 verbal discussion at evening meetings.                  As  papers    are more intel
 ligible and attractive          when     illustrated    by diagrams, authors of
 papers      are     encouraged     to   exhibit diagrams whenever that is
 possible,    the Society paying the cost of them, subject to certain

284                  Proceedings of         the   Royal Society
checks.      Discussion almost invariably takes place               ;  though whether
any previous arrangement to ensure this is made,                         I  cannot   tell.
After     the    public   business is        over,   there   is an adjournment          to
an    adjoining      apartment for refreshments;               in which       apartment
there are comfortable chairs and sofas, where members and                           their
friends can        chat together     if they like.         There      is also at   these
meetings      a  greater variety of refreshments than              we provide.
    I  trust   I  may be excused for referring             to these      common-place
details, but     I  attach so much importance to a good attendance at
our evening meetings, that            I   would desire to leave no means un
tried to secure it.
    What     are the means which, for this purpose,              I  suggest?
    1st,  I  think that    papers    of   so abstruse       a  nature as not to be
intelligible to three-fourths of the              members,     ought not to be read,
nor even an       abstract of them, — but only           a verbal account given        of
the nature of the paper, and its bearings.
    2d,    No    paper,  however intelligible, should be read verbatim,
unless it occupy only          a few    minutes, say fifteen or twenty, but
only an abstract of it shall be read or verbally stated.
    '6d,  The    members     of Council         to whom the paper has been            re
ferred to report on its fitness for the Society should be prepared,
after the author has read his paper or stated its substance,                     to give
their opinion of the merits of the paper, the President for the night
also adding a few remarks.
    4:th,  Diagrams, where       possible,      ought to be exhibited,          one-half
of the cost of which should            be   paid from the Society's funds, sub
ject to the check of a committee.
    5th,   It shall be competent for          a  Fellow   at the commencement          of
business,     with the leave       of the Secretary and President                for the
night, to exhibit any article or object, organic or inorganic, or any
 instrument       of scientific interest recently discovered or invented,
and give      a  short verbal explanation, it being understood that such
verbal explanations shall be concluded before 8.15                     p.m., so that the
written papers announced in the billet may then be proceeded with.
    6th, There      ought to    be   in the retiring-room           something better
provided, in the way of refreshment, than                a cup of tea, as also chairs
or sofas for the convenience of those who attend the meetings.
    2.   The next point to which          I   advert is the existence of certain

                      of Edinburgh,         Session 1870-71.                         285
 drawbacks to the efficiency and             influence of our Society, and the
possibility    of counteracting       these.
   When       our Royal      Society     was   established, now nearly ninety
years    ago,   no other      society devoted         to literature     or to science
existed in      Edinburgh.         It  was therefore natural          and     right that
the   Society should        embrace,      among its objects, all the depart
ments    of knowledge       which were then known, or were beginning to
be  cultivated.
   The rapid      extension     of different      sciences     soon  rendered it im
possible for one       society to give due attention to all these, or to
assist  investigators in      each, to the     full extent that they desired.
   Hence      separate societies came to be formed, devoted to parti
cular sciences ; and these          societies were naturally joined by many
persons    who. but for them, would have probably become members
of our   Royal Society.
   Wl, «t has been the consequence?                  We    have   in Edinburgh, and
our  other large towns, very many institutions,                    both    literary   and
scientific,    which   are strong      in membership;          and even in our pro
vinces,    we    have societies and clubs, devoted               to botany, geology,
zoology, and archaeology,          some    of which also possess           a   large staff
of members.
   Let me enumerate the membership of some of the Edinbuigh
societies   : —
The   Medico-Chirurgical Society, instituted         1821,
                                      ....
         has about                                           300    Members.

 The   Society of Antiquaries,                               300       „           „
 The   Royal Society of Arts, instituted       1821, has     420       „           „
 The Meteorological     Society, instituted     1856,   .    600       „           „
    With regard to provincial             societies,    I   may mention          that Sir
 Walter Elliot* of Wolfelee               has   lately     been   making       out a list
 of Natural        History     Societies     and     Field    Clubs,     existing     not
   *  The list here refeired to will be found in an address delivered by Sir
 Walter   Elliot to the Botanical Society of Edinburgh on 10th November 1870 ;
 and  is to be printed in that Society's Transactions for 1870-71.

 286                    Proceedings       of  the   Royal Society
 only in Scotland, but in England                   and    Ireland.       This list will
 be exceedingly          instructive,     as  I  understand it specifies the ob
jects of each Society or Club, the                nature of its operations, and the
 district    of country with which it             is connected.         He   has had the
 kindness to send to me an account of twelve of these provincial
 societies, the most northern              being in Orkney and Shetland,                 the
 most southern in Berwickshire,                 Dumfries, and Galloway.             About
 one-half of these societies publish proceedings or reports in some
 form or other, for circulation among their own members.                           To one
of    these   last-mentioned         provincial      societies,    connected with       the
 Eastern      Borders of England and                Scotland,      "The Berwickshire
 Naturalists'       Club," Sir Walter Elliot              and    I   belong.    It   has   a
 membership of 250 persons, and has published six octavo volumes
of reports on topics — Botanical,                Geological,      Zoological,    Entomo
 logical, and Archaeological.
    Though it is chiefly the Edinburgh                  societies which keep mem
bers from our Royal            Society Roll, and papers             from our Transac
tions, there can         be no  doubt that the societies of other towns, and
of the provinces, act more or less in the same direction.                           But in
saying this of any of these separate societies,                 I   mean no disparage
ment of them         ;  nor, in spite     of their interference with our useful
ness and influence, do           I  regret their multiplication.            On the prin
ciple of the division          of labour, the more societies the better, for
the     sake   of the stimulus          they give      to scientific     investigations.
The late Principal           Forbes, in      his address      from this chair in the
year 1862, in alluding to the effect which these societies had on
us, thought that they
                               "   fostered   (to use his own words) a spirit of
rivalry towards the larger, more national, and more permanent
Institution, which the Royal Society of Edinburgh might fairly
claim to be."          I have   never seen indications of a spirit of rivalry,
in the sense of hostility.             All  the   length     I  can   go is to admit —
as, indeed,      I  affirm — that the existence of so many separate scien
tific societies in Scotland has the effect of curtailing our member
ship and our operations, and that this effect will increase unless
means be devised to counteract it.
    I  think    such    means may be devised,              and    with advantage, not
only to our own and other societies, but to the                       cause   of  science.
There      are     many     researches      and    inquiries     which     can   he    pro

secuted successfully             only by the        co-operation       of many       persons
Acting together, or acting               in different districts.           Opportunity    for
such co-operation            might be afforded         by separate        societies.   Thus
the     Committee of the British Association                     on Luminous         Meteors
lately appbed            to the    Scottish     Meteorological        Society to have a
certain number            of their   observers,    situated in different parts of the
country, told off to watch on particular                    nights the occurrence of
meteors,       and    mark down on maps              furnished      to them their posi
tions,      the    direction     of their movements, and other particulars.
That is an example of two independent scientific bodies co-operat
ing together.            What I next mention shows the co-operation of six
or eight       societies.       In Switzerland,        and in the South of France,
the     various      Natural History          and    Physical Societies          have   been
carrying on a           joint investigation        to record      the   exact position of
the mopt       remarkable "boulders"              in the districts with which they
are severally          connected.       For this     purpose      one central society —
the     Helvetic Society         — has    issued    to the societies at Neufchatel,
 Berne,      Aargau, Geneva, Lyons, and Grenoble, suitable maps                          and
schedules.          These societies         have   already made great advances             in
 ascertaining        and marking         down the exact position of numerous
boulders       above      100 tons     in weight.        They      have    done    more, for
 they     have     succeeded       in   stopping      the wholesale destruction            of
 loulders,       which      were    being' victimised        to   agricultural      improve
 ments; and so much have                   their objects been appreciated by the
 municipal        and State authorities, that the latter pay the cost                 of the
 necessary       printing,     and other expenses required for the investiga
tion .*
     Another case of co operation nearer home may                           be   mentioned'.
 Professor Roscoe of Manchester is forming what he calls a
 "
     National Science Union," embracing not only scientific inves
 tigations, but also, and even               more   especially, action on the Legis'
 lature and the           Government.          With reference         to this last object,
  he observes,        that "although         those    who are engaged           in scientific
  investigation        or instruction,       undoubtedly        form one of the         most
  intelligent professions in the kingdom                   ;  yet, for want of union,

they have no commensurate influence on the Legislature.                                           The
interests of commerce,                      manufactures,      agriculture,       railways,       and
the clerical, legal, naval, and military professions are represented
by strong parties in Parliament,                         yet there are very few members
of either House who can be said to represent the high interests of
science.            It   is therefore urged that no time should be lost in
creating an organisation, which will enable those interested in the
progress         of      science    to use their         proper influence, and when                the
time arrives, to press their legitimate claims upon the Legislature."
A programme                has been widely circulated            for the purpose of asce r-
tuining         how far the             proposals contained         in    it    meet   with        the
support of men cultivating                                living in
                                               all branches of science, and
all parts of the country. Professor Roscoe adds, that   "  the pre
sent moment appears to be well suited  for action in this   matter,
as the establishment                   of   a union       amongst men of science              must
strengthen the hands of the Royal Commission                                    now considering
the whole subject of State aid to science."
      The movement thus                 commenced,         and going on in various quar
ters for co-operation and confederation, deserves our consideration.
We         see the       important purposes which may be thereby attained,
not only by facilitating important physical investigations, but also
by    giving        to scientific bodies a greater power and influence                       in   the
country to which they are well entitled.
      If   it   be asked         how co-operation          and confederation can best              be
secured,        I    may perhaps be               told that it will      be enough      to    trust
to sympathy with                 each    other, created by the pursuit of common
objects,        and that no special or formal alliance is necessary.                               As
among all the branches of human knowledge relationship prevails,
so    it   is said       there is naturally and unavoidably a similar connec
tion       among societies.                 But    the    well-known      Roman        aphorism
which speaks of this relationship,                       speaks also of a bond to cement
it,    " Omnes           artes   quae    ad    humanitatem       pertinent,        habent com
mune vinculum, et quasi cognatione quadem inter se continentur."
The " commune vinculum " here referred to,         think, desir           is,
                                                                           I
able   ;    and that bond may fitly be constituted by                     a     central society,
which, embracing in its own programme of operations various
sciences,        holds out         a   hand of welcome         anil co-operatiou to other
societies,       severally devoted             to some one of these             sciences.         The

                           of Edinburgh        ,  Session 1870-71.                     289
late       Principal       Forbes    strongly      maintained the expediency           of  a
central         society    on a separate       ground, which is explained in the
following paragraphs of his address.                    He urged that —
     " To maintain tho
                              character for energy and stability of one central society,
it in reality the common interest of all who cultivate science.                  Delightful
and instructive         meetings    may    be held by    a local body    of geologists, or
chemists, or naturalists.          But such local associations require immense vitality
to be permanent.             Generally they fall into abeyance in twenty or thirty
 vears : and if they attempt to record their labours by publications, these
publications having never attained more than a very limited circulation, be
 come       inaccessible    and forgotten.       The matured written     reports  of these
 labours in minor societies, are best consigned for preservation            to the publica
 tions of a central and enduring association."
       All    these views evidently point to our own Society, as being one
  well qualified         to undertake the duties and position               of a central
  body       in order to promote         co-operation and         confederation among
  the      various scientific bodies         in Scotland      ;  and  if it   be objected
  that my views could not be carried out without some considerable
  change in our established              customs,     I have     only to say, that as in
  tiovernments, it          is wise to make from time to time such reforms as
   are    called   for,   in order     to retain     public     confidence, or promote
   more      efficient action    ; bo  in other institutions, it is equally expedi
   ent to       watch the progress        of  events,   which may necessitate from
   time to time some changes in their modes                   of operation.
       The changes, however, which would benefit both our own Society
   and others, are        really not so important, as that the Council of its
   own       authority    may not competently adopt them.                   They    are as
    follows     :—
        (1«(.)   That should any society in Scotland having literary or
    scientific objects, desire to be connected with the                Royal Society of
    Edinburgh, it shall,        if our Council      approves,    be held to be affiliated
     w'tb us, and to be entitled to the privileges of an affiliated society.
         (2d*.)  That any member of an affiliated society, on intimating
     to our                 his name and address,           shall receive a billet, en
                secretary
     titling him to free access to our meetings, as well as to our library
     tnd reading-room.
          (W.) That an affiliated society shall have right to send to us,
      through its office-bearers, reports or papers by any of its members,
      on literary or    scientific subjects, which       if  approved   by the Council,

290                   Proceedings          of the Royal Society
maybe read at our evening meetings, and may be published in our
Transactions.
  (4th.) That our Council, on the other hand, shall be entitled to
appeal to any affiliated society for co-operation in the ascertainment
of facts, or the investigation    of phenomena, lying within the com
pass    of its objects, and also within the field of its operations ; and
if,   in response to this appeal,         a   report   is   made, we may,         if   approved
by the Council, have             it   read or noticed        at our meetings, and          pub
lished in our Transactions.
  (5th.) That in the event of any important investigations or ex
periments being wished to be made by the members of an affiliated
society, which however cannot be made by them on account of the
expense thereof,          it   shall be competent for the office-bearers                of such
affiliated society to apply to the Council of our Society to defray                           a
portion of the expense,               out of the funds of our Society, or out of
an annual grant, should such be obtained from Government,                                     to
aid scientific investigations             in Scotland.
      Some   such arrangements            as those  I       have   now suggested, would
probably produce co-operation among most of the societies in Scot
land devoted         to science        or literature,    a   co-operation which would
be    attended by advantages, both              to them and to the advancement
of their objects.
      IV. In   adverting,        under the next head               of this address, to       the
usefulness     of   such societies as ours,       it    is   only necessary to observe
that they have been established to aid philosophers in the peculiar
work to which they devote themselves.                         Whether         we regard the
work they accomplish, or the motives which inspire them, these
philosophers        deserve       all the encouragement and               aid which         can
be given.       They love knowledge for its own                        sake   — their chief
                                                                              ;
pleasure consists in searching for knowledge                       ;
                                                                    — and their highest
happiness      is    to discover        some   new      truth.      Fortunately         for the
world, there have been in all ages, and among almost every people,
individuals     who have cherished those noble aspirations.                 The old
Hebrew       king    has recorded, how he               " applied his heart to know
and seek out the reasons of              things,"    and avouched from experience,
how "Happy           is   the man who findeth wisdom."                   The enlightened
Roman expressed the same sentiment when he exclaimed,                                   " Felix

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                               291
 qui potuit rerum         cognoscere     causas."       The Greek mathematician,
 on   discovering that       the square     of  the hypothenuse in       aright-angled
 triangle     is equal to the sum         of  the squares     of the other two sides,
in    testimony      of his happiness         offered    a hecatomb      to the gods      ;
whilst a     Sicilian philosopher, when he found how to ascertain the
specific    gravity of bodies, was so overjoyed, that he rushed out of
his bath       naked     into the streets,        mad with delight.        Our own Sir
Isaac Newton          became      so elated or agitated when approaching              the
end    of his calculations,         which he saw would prove that the plane
tary movements were all governed by the law                     of gravitation, — that
law    which he was the first to               discover, — that    he was obliged       to
hand      over his calculations to          a  friend to complete them.           These
men, and        thousands      more    of  the    same   stamp,   were    all animated
by a    heaven-born        instinct    to pry into the mysteries of nature, to
study the mechanism                of the universe,       and   deduce    the   rules or
principles which the Almighty had followed in the work of crea
tion, and       still follows in the equally great work of upholding the
universe.         Their tastes were noble, because pure ; their researches
 and    labours also were noble, because               disinterested.     They worked
 not   for their own individual benefit, nor even               for that of their own
 kin or country,        but for that of the human race.            Men characterised
 by such        tastes, such      motives, and such         pursuits,   surely deserve
 encouragement,          and  if scientific   societies afford it — their usefulness
 is  unquestionable.
     How these societies afford this encouragement                     I  have already
  partly     explained,      when     adverting       to our own operations, and
  in   particular      to the     stimulus      given    to men     of   science,   when
  by   means       of our meetings,          and    our Transactions,       they obtain
   an  opportunity       of intimating         their   discoveries    and     publishing
   them.        It is probable that there are thousands of discoveries —
   the groundwork           of important         inventions,  — which      never would
   have    become      known, — nay, which never would              have     been  made,
   but  for the existence of such societies as ours.                 For example, the
   Principia of Newton            would not have been given to the world at
   the  time they were given, had the Royal                   Society of London        not
   agreed    to print them      ;  for Newton        was so poor, that he could not
   afford   to continue       his subscription        as a member      of the Society,
   small as      that was.

292                Proceedings    of the Royal Society
   Whilst philosophers     are encouraged by these societies       to investi
gate, by knowing      that their discoveries will be recorded and pub
lished by the societies of which they are members,               others who
may or may not        be   members,   when they see these         discoveries
and study their bearings, are often able to turn them to account,
and in a way never anticipated by the authors.          Hundreds of cases
can be stated, where papers published in scientific        transactions, on
being perused     and   studied by other inquirers often in a distant
part of the world, have been to them as bridges, enabling them to
pass over difficulties   which previously had obstructed progress, and
on the brink of which they had been sitting in despair.
   That scientific societies contribute immensely to the advance
ment of knowledge, may be farther inferred from this circum
stance,   that as it is during     the last fifty years   that discoveries
and inventions have been more          plentiful than in any former         age,
so  it is during the last fifty years that these societies have multi
plied, and a wide circulation given to their published transactions.
    To  these societies mainly, mankind is therefore indebted for the
marvellous contrivances and processes         which distinguish       the pre
sent age above all that have preceded        it.   Most  of these — such       as
electro-magnetism,      electro-plating,  photography,      artificial    light,
improved telescopes       and microscopes, steam machinery, anaesthe-
tical agents and medical disinfectants     — sprung out of experiments,
observations, or speculations, were very unpromising             as regarded
any practical utility when first announced, but ultimately became
sources    of incalculable   material wealth, as well as of vastly in
creased comfort and enjoyment to man.
    These triumphs of modern science, are also the chief elements of
our present civilisation,    and for them the world is indebted chiefly
 to scientific bodies such as ours.
    V. In adverting     to the last head   of this  address, viz.     : —on   the
 best  way of encouraging and aiding such societies as ours,         I  have to
                                                              —
 remark that it may be effected in two ways, viz , directly, by
 grants and accommodations from the State            ;  and indirectly,       by
 creating among all classes of the population          a greater taste for
 scientific pursuits.
    1.  Taking   the indirect   method first, it is hardly necessary           to

                        of Edinburgh,          Session    1870-71.                     293
  point out how, as      this scientific      taste increases, persons      will  be more
  inclined     to join    societies of a scientific          nature.      The practical
 question then arises how this taste can be increased?
     At   a former period       I had    the faith which many others had in the
 efficacy    of mechanics' institutes.            But having had       some experience
 of the    working of      these    institutions,    I  am now satisfied that popu
 lar lectures do very         little  else than afford amusement, — though in
that respect       they are not altogether useless.                 But if they are to
give     instruction, and promote habits of observation, or a taste for
scientific      pursuits,    they must inculcate           and    administer     the hard
discipline      of personal study.          Accordingly, many mechanics' insti
tutes have established             classes for different branches of study, and
with much advantage.
     I confess,    however, that      I have more      faith in the instruction which
begins at au earlier           period of life than can be conveniently given
at   mechanics'       institutes.      I   have seen that boys even under four
teen    or fifteen years of age may acquire a taste for scientific pursuits,
and habits        of accurate observation — very serviceable, in whatever
field    of useful industry they may afterwards engage. No interfer
ence with essential branches of study would be necessary.                           In our
Scottish parish         schools, the time now spent in teaching French
and     German*      to the children        of the working      classes, would perhaps
be     more usefully spent in teaching                 the elements of physiology,
botany, chemistry, or geology                ;  and as it is now the general prac
tice    in all primary schools to have an entire holiday on Saturday,
 that day of idleness or mischief would be more beneficially spent
 in a walk along the sea coast,              or up a    hill side, or through a rocky
 dell, or even along          hedges     and ditches, accompanied by a master
 competent       to point     out objects of interest.           Who     can doubt that
 in the course      of such rambles, aided by             a small amount       of indoor
 instruction, seed would be sown in many a boy's mind and disposi
 tion, which would bear good              fruit of  a scientific    kind in after    years.
 I am     glad to be able to say, that          I know   of  several   parish schools in
 East Lothian and in Perthshire,                 where the masters, having them
 selves a turn for science,            have a class for instruction          in the par
 ticular branch with which                they are conversant.           In  one school,
     *  I see from this   year's Education        Report, that in the parochial schools,
 tli o number learning      these languages is 2500.

294                  Proceedings     of the Royal Society
chemical experiments are made once or twice in the                month.     In
another school, the teacher has       a telescope,  through which     he shows
to the older boys       of  his school the    moon and larger planets.        In
another school,      a small collection of specimens has been        formed    to
illustrate the rocks and minerals of the neighbourhood.               The  chief
drawback in this matter. next to the want of teachers               competent
and well-disposed, has been the want          of suitable text-books.        But
I  am glad to find from       the Secretary of the Education       Committee,
that this last drawback is being removed,            as he has himself      been
preparing Elementary Science School Books, with the assistance                  of
Professor Kelland, Professor Balfour,           Mr Archer, Mr Geikie,        and
other eminent scientific men.
    Whilst    on the subject of scientific    instruction  in schools,    I can
not avoid referring to the very gratifying encouragement given                 by
the Government Department at South Kensington.               That   encourage
ment is very considerable, consisting not only of money rewards                 to
pupils and teachers,       but also of apparatus and books to           schools.
It  is already producing       fruit; for whilst last year, the     number of
schools in       Scotland    which   received    these  Government        grants
amounted to 24, this year they are 45, being an increase of               nearly
100 per cent.
    Therefore,    as these  science and art classes in schools are multi
plying,    a taste for  science will no doubt quickly germinate among
the    working     and   middle classes,    thus   supplying   candidates       in
greater numbers for scientific pursuits and scientific societies.*
    2.  The foregoing remarks apply to the aids given indirectly                 to
societies.     I  next notice the amount of aid given directly by              the
State.
    Here it is proper to distinguish       the aid given to science       classes
in schools, from the aid given to scientific societies.         In  the former
   * Since this address was delivered, I see (Nature, Dec. 22,
                                                                  1870) that an
address   has been presented by the President of the British Association for
the Advancement of Science, supported by the office-bearers and an influen
tial deputation, comprehending Sir Charles Lyell, Sir John Lubbock, Dr
Lyon Playfair, and Mr Francis Galton, — to the Vice-President of the Privv
Council Committee on Education, pointing out the expediency of authorising,
in the new national elementary schools, systematic instruction in elementary
science, so as to create a taste among the pupils, whereby they may be in
duced to follow out scientific studies in the more advanced schools.

                         of Edinburgh,         Session 1870-71.                         295
case, aid     is  given for instruction in facts and principles which are
already     known.         In   the latter case, aid is given for searching new
facts and new          principles.      It is very evident that the latter object
i*  all important.          if  any   advances     in knowledge are to be made.
Moreover,       it    is an object which needs            more    help from external
sources.     The student who obtains technical knowledge, or the know
ledge   which fits him for a profitable trade or profession, may not
unfairly be left to pay the expense                of his instruction, in considera
tion  of the gains which that trade or profession will bring to him.
With     an   investigator         of scientific    phenomena, who hopes to dis
cover    some new           principle,    the case is widely         different.     As bis
impelliug motive             is not the prospect of gain, so in nine cases out
of ten the     original discoverer of          a new   law, or a new principle, or         a
new product,         is not the man who ever benefits by it in                a pecuniary
sense.      Whilst       he sows the seed, others reap the fruit, and                yet, to
procure the seed,           probably much capital had to            be  spent and years
of study      endured, at the sacrifice of both health and                         fortune.
Therefore the man who devotes                    his time to the discovery of new
truths,    and who bravely adheres               to that pursuit in spite of diffi
culties and         embarrassments, is surely             a   man   standing      in   more
 need   of help and             encouragement than the engineer or artisan
or mechanic          who is receiving instruction             which will enable         him
to  follow a profitable profession.               If  the latter deserves       assistance
from    the State,        much more should the former.                  These investiga
tors  of >cience are the men of whom                   a  country, when it possesses
them. should           be proud     ; and   it would   be a bad sign of the age            if
such    men did not exist, or               if  no interest was       felt about      them.
When ancient Rome was becoming degenerate,                             the question      was
significantly          asked — "Quis       nunc     virtutom     amplectitur,      proemia
si  tollas?"           So also    it would     be a sign of the degeneracy             of   a
people,     were no one to embrace                science,    except from        the hope
 of profit; and         it would     be equally a sign of a degenerate             Govern
 ment,    if it    refused      to encourage       men     of science      and    scientific
 societies.
    In all civilised countries such encouragement is given                             in   a
 greater or less degree,           and   in one form or another.             Whether     the
 amount of the encouragement given by the                         British Government
 is sufficient,       is  a   point on which        1  at   present    offer  no opinion.

But    one    thing       is obvious,      viz., that whatever             were the            difficulties
which, thirty or forty years ago, investigators                                 of       new       facts and
new    principles          had to encounter, these                  difficulties              are    tenfold
greater now, and therefore                      help       to   overcome these    difficulties
ought now to be more                   ample.          The      first discoveries in all the
sciences      were    made        by methods and                processes       far more              simple
than    are    now serviceable.                 The first         steps    in astronomy                 were
made    by the human                eye    alone.          After all the knowledge                       was
collected, which the unaided eye could supply, the next advances
in the science were made                    by telescopes         — telescopes                simple     and
rude   at first, but soon superseded                       by others of greater size and
more    accurate construction,                  so    as    to admit of a farther pene
tration into         the depths of ethereal space,                        and        a    more minute
examination of the movements and forms of the planetary bodies.
When       an eclipse       of the sun          has to be observed,                  the only        way of
now proceeding             is,   besides employing              highly improved telescopes,
to have       also the spectroscope,                 the polariscope, and photographic
apparatus     ;   and,     in order to use these                  instruments                 to the best
advantage,  large parties of observers must co-operate, and, at
a great sacrifice of time and money, repair to favourable and
probably remote spots on the earth's surface.                              So   it       is   with all the
other sciences.            To enable       a    chemist to make discoveries now in
his science,         he    must have apparatus and instruments                                  ten times
more    numerous and expensive than those                               with which                  chemists
formerly worked.  The botanical physiologist can make no farther
advances, except by means of powerful microscopes, which to his
predecessor were unknown.   For progress in meteorology, obser
vations by individuals,               in   a   few districts       once     or twice           a    day, are
no longer      of much avail.              There must be            a     complete network of
observations         made        over large portions of the earth's                 surface —
and at least three or four times in the twenty-four                                      hours.       There
must be self-recording                instruments           in particular districts, besides
occasional ascents in             a   balloon.        In short, there          is    no one science
which can now be advanced                      by the same simple means which were
available formerly.               Science would stand still               if   improved methods
were    not resorted to.               The difficulties,          therefore, which men of
science and scientific societies have to encounter in their researches
are far greater than formerly, and what may have been                                          a   sufficient

                            of Edinburgh,      Session 1870-71.                          297
amount         of aid and encouragement                to them twenty or      thirty   years
ago is now             manifestly quite inadequate.
     Another           obstacle in the way of farther discovery must not be
overlooked.              A great proportion of the philosophers who search
after new          truths and new principles           are teachers, whose income as
such alone             enables them to obtain the means, scanty and precarious
as    it     is,   of prosecuting      original     investigations.         But as know
ledge       advances, the labours of instruction                increase;    — and    if   the
teacher        does      his duty in that capacity very little time              is   left to
allow       of extraneous       investigations.  Yet these persons               are often
better      qualified       to be investigators of new truths, than teachers of
old    truths.         I   have in my own experience met with professors in
our   universities           whose occupation in the work of -teaching deprived
science        of those who       most probably would have been instrumental
in    making great discoveries.
     The circumstances            to which  I     have   been   adverting,     as obstacles
to the       future        advancement of science, were felt to be so serious,
that two           years   ago they engaged the attention         of the British Asso
ciation — an association            whose    chief object   it   is" to give stronger
                                                                                a
impulse and               more systematic         to scientific inquiry," and
                                             direction
"to remove              any disadvantages of  public kind which impede its
                                                   a
progress."              The view submitted to the Association by those who
brought the subject before              it   was, that as there are institutions           for
teaching           old truths,   so there ought to be institutions          for discovering
new        truths, and that, as this last work had now become so difficult
and        costly, that few individuals        could enter on         it   from their own
resources, the State— which, on behalf of the great interests of the
country, is interested to encourage discoveries and investigations                         —
ought to come               forward and establish institutions,             in which    men
with an aptitude for             original investigations might have facilities for
carrying them on, without being distracted by any other vocation.
      The British Association            so far entered         into these views as to
appoint            a   committee, consisting of some of its most eminent and
influential members, and the two following questions were put to
the    committee for consideration            : —
  "(1.) Does there exist in the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Ireland sufficient provision for the vigorous prosecution of
physical research            ?

298                  Proceedings     of the Royal Society
    "
      (2.)  If not, what further provision is needed, and what measures
should be taken to secure it ? "
    At the meeting of the Association              in    1869   that   committee
reported —
    "(1.) That the provision now existing             in the   United Kingdom
of Great Britain      and Ireland is far from sufficient for the vigorous
prosecution of physical research.
    "(2.) That, whilst greatly increased facilities for extending and
systematising       physical   research   are required, your committee          do
not consider it expedient that they should attempt to define how
these facilities    should be provided."
    In explanation of this last finding,            the    committee      observed
that—
    " Any scheme of scientific extension should be based on a full and accurate
 knowledge of the amount of aid now given to science, of the sources from
 which that aid is derived, and of the functions performed by individuals and
 institutions  receiving such aid.    Your committee have found it impossible,
 with the means and powers at their command, to acquire this knowledge.
 Moreover, as the whole question of the relation of the State to science, at pre
 sent in a very unsettled and unsatisfactory position, is involved, they urge
 that a Royal Commission alone is competent      to deal with the subject."
     The Association approved of this report, and appointed applica
 tion to be made to her Majesty's           Government       to appoint a Royal
 Commission to consider the whole subject.                This application was
 successful;     for, in May 1870, the Gazette announced the names of
 nine Commissioners, with power " to make inquiry with regard to
  Scientific   Instruction     and  the Advancement         of   Science,   and to
 inquire what aid thereto is derived from grants voted by Parlia
  ment, or from endowments belonging to the several Universities
  in Great Britain and Ireland, and the Colleges thereof, and whether
 such aid could be rendered in a manner more effectual for the pur
 pose."
     The importance of this measure            I need not dwell upon.         The
 backwardness of the British Government                 to aid institutions    and
  individuals devoted to scientific        investigations, and the miserable
 amount of any pittances conceded             to them, affect     the  credit and
 prosperity of the country quite        as  much as the interests of science.
  Great Britain, whose       influence in the world depends almost more
 on moral than on physical           power, ought not to        be   behind other

 cations     in its patronage of science. Yet what has happened within
 the last    six weeks? A remarkable eclipse of the sun, to take place
on the      22d of this month, had been looked forward to by astro
 nomers as       affording an excellent opportunity for solving many
important questions regarding the constitution of that great orb
on which all living things in our planet, and in other planets also,
depend;        but, for the proper observation of which eclipse, expedi
tions     were    necessary,     requiring     much previous preparation              and
great expense.           The    United       States     Government,      even       eight
months        ago,   began preparations,        a sum      of L.6400 having         been
unanimously           voted   by   Congress,*         and   a   Government       officer
despatched         to visit Spain      and     Sicily, to find proper        places    of
observation,        and to make suitable           arrangements      for the recep
tion     of a party of astronomers.              A ship of the United            States
navy was appointed           to convey them, accompanied by two eminent
engineer officers, representing            the Government, to take          a  general
charge.
    In England what            were   the    arrangements for this interesting
astronomical         phenomenon     ?    Early last spring,      on the suggestion
of    the Astronomer Royal,          a  committee was formed, consisting of
himself and the           Presidents     of the Royal Astronomical            Society,
 and    of the Royal Society of London, to organise an expedition.                     A
 party of astronomers soon volunteered,                   about  sixty   in   number,
 who were to be divided into two parties, one for Spain and another
 for   Sicily,   each   subdivided     into sections, to make different kinds
 of observations, with suitable            instruments.        As total obscuration
 would      last only two minutes, the more               that the work could be

 In the same Congress there were additional appropriations to the amount of
 no less than 1,377,766 dollars, for the support of Museums, Botanic Gardens,
 Mining Statistics, Polar Explorations, Surveys, and other objects of a scien
 tific nature.      These appropriations, be it observed, were by the Federal
 Government.        Similar appropriations, but larger altogether in amount, are
 made by the different States in aid of their own societies.

300                         Proceedings of         the   Royal Society
distributed among different observers the better.                            The Committee
had entertained no doubt that her Majesty's                               Government       would
give ready,           if    not liberal, assistance.          On    the last occasion of a
solar eclipse         — viz., in        1868 — several    European Governments                 sent
expeditions           to    India, where it could            best be viewed.           Ours gave
the use of a ship, besides appointing officers, and paying expenses.
But     when   the committee, last summer, applied to the Admiralty
to ascertain           if    one       of her Majesty's      ships would be allowed               to
convey the English astronomers, the answer they received was that
Parliament had not placed either ships or funds at the disposal
of the Admiralty for any such purpose.                             This   was a rebuff         little
anticipated       ;    and,        I    may add,    little   deserved       by those of our
countrymen, who, in a noble spirit of disinterestedness, had offered
to give up their time, and leave                    their homes, to undergo fatigue
and risk in the cause of science.                        In consequence of this answer
some delay arose, to consider what                        was to be done.              An appeal
against the decision of the Admiralty, to the Tremier                                    and     the
Chancellor            of the Exchequer,            was    resolved on.         Some       farther
delay occurred in consequence  of the absence of these high
functionaries from London.  Meanwhile, the United States ship
arrived in England, bringing with them the American astronomers.
They soon learnt the unsatisfactory position of the negotiation
with our Government ; and, in consequence of       they sent a               it,
formal invitation through their director, inviting the English
astronomers to accompany them in their ship to Spain and Sicily.
This letter was published in the London newspapers and severe                      ;
comments were made by the press on our executive,                             if   they should
oblige the English party to avail themselves of the invitation, and
be beholden to   foreign Government for assistance. Fortunately
                            a
for the credit of the country, our Government at length yielded to
the pressure.      sum of L.3000 was agreed to be set apart to pay
                           A
expenses,      and         a    troop ship was appointed to convey the party and
their  instruments.      But no Government astronomer received
authority to accompany the expedition, and no engineer officer, or
other official representing the Government, was appointed to take
charge     of the expedition,        and give assistance.   In all                             these
respects    the       British Government fell far short of what had                            been
done by the United States Government, to aid in the cause.

                        of Edinburgh,        Session   1870-71.                  301
     I  have related thus        fully the circumstances connected with this
  Solar Eclipse        Expedition, because it has occurred recently, and
  therefore shows too        plainly the indifference      to science,  and to men
 of science,      which     actuates     those who manage the affairs of this
 country.        It  is, however, a charge which unfortunately              does not
 lie at the      door of the present executive alone.             The   same   indif
 ference has been too clearly manifested                 by almost all preceding
Governments.              Unmistakable        evidence    of this   indifference   is
afforded by       the treatment of the societies and associations formed
tor    the   advancement         of science. What aid is given to any of
these?         The only part of the United Kingdom in which such aid
is liberally given is in Ireland.*                  Except to the Academy of
Music in London, which receives                   annually   a grant of L.500,      I
know     of no Society of         a  scientific  character, either in England or
in Scotland,          which    receives any grant       to carry out its special
objects.        The only patronage to English scientific societies              con
sists   in the     free use   of Government apartments in London            to seven
of these        societies,   and    the free    use  of Government       apartments
in  Edinburgh to         two Scotch societies — viz., the Royal Society          and
the    Society of Antiquaries.          f   There is another society which has
been     very kindly allowed to occupy two small apartments in the
General        Post-Office    Buildings; but for the       use of these    a rent is
exacted      ;   and, moreover,       from this society statistical information
is obtained         by Government, for which, however, Government does
 not pay, and declines to pay.
    This illiberal feature of the British Government in not aiding
 voluntary associations for scientific objects, is the more remark
 able considering          the principle      which   our Government adopts for
    *  In Dublin there are six societies, two of which are for the encourage
 ment of the fine arts, particularly painting, which receive about L.13,000
 yearly,   to enable them to carry out their special objects and to keep their
 buildings in repair.        (See Report of Royal Commissioners on Aid given to
 Irish Societies, presented to Parliament in 1869.)
    t The Royal Society of Edinburgh has, since the year 1836, received from
 the Exchequer a yearly sum of L.800 to enable them to pay rent, taxes, and
 maintenance of the apartments they occupy.            The rent charged by Govern
 ment for these apartments is L.260.             The Society of Antiquaries receives
 L.300, which is all applied to pay the officers who take charge of the Museum,
 and the necessary repairs and cleaning.               The Museum belongs to the
 Government.

other associations having objects not more beneficial to the public.
The principle      is,   that when funds are voluntarily supplied                       from
local sources, the State supplements these by an addition of as much
money from the Exchequer.                 The local subscriptions             are   justly
taken as evidence that the objects are praiseworthy,                     and that they
are appreciated by the community                ;    whilst any risk of misapplica
tion or mismanagement            is   avoided by an annual report to Govern
ment.       This principle      has     been      applied to schools and various
other educational institutions,            to     volunteer corps,      to county con
stabulary, &c.
  Whilst pointing out the illiberal, short-sighted, and inconsistent
policy of the British Government in not assisting scientific socie
ties with pecuniary grants to aid them,                 it   would be wrong in me
not to take grateful        notice of     a     parliamentary grant of L.1000             a
year given to encourage scientific                  investigations     carried on any
where in the United Kingdom                  or colonies of Great Britain.                Of
this grant    I   could find no authentic              account in any publication.
General rumour only was my authority for believing                         that such      a
grant existed, and that         it    was at the disposal   of the Royal Society
of London.        On my speaking to            Professor Balfour on the subject,         I
found that he could give me no information, but he kindly under
took to apply to Dr Sharpey, the secretary of the Royal Society of
London.    Dr Sharpey at once responded, by sending      memoran          a
dum explanatory of the grant— memorandum which appears to
                                              a

    " In   1849 the  First Lord of the Treasury (Lord John Russell)
offered, on the    part of the Government, to place L.1000 at the dis
posal of the  Royal Society, to be by them applied towards the
advancement of science.
  " This offer was            The first payment was made in 1850,
                   accepted.
and   it   has been repeated      annually up to the present time.                  Up    to
1855 the grant was paid from             a     special fund at the disposal of the
Treasury, but since then   has been annually voted by Parliament.
                                 it
   " The Council of the
                         Royal Society consider the grant as  con                   a
tribution on the part of the nation towards the promotion of science

                        of Edinburgh,        Session 1870-71.                       303
  generally     in her Majesty's dominions,             regarding     themselves      as
 trustees    of the grant,       and   accountable to the public for its due
 administration, as long as it shall be continued.
    "
       To aid the Council in the distribution            of the fund,    a committee
 is annually      appointed,      consisting of the 21 members of the Coun
cil and 21      Fellows of the Society not on the Council, selected on
account      of their acquaintance with the different branches of science
which the       Society cultivates.        All applications for grants from the
fund are      submitted to this committee, and the appropriations are
made      by the Council on the committee's recommendation.
    "
       The grants are commonly                made   to individuals engaged          in
some     definite     scientific investigation,    chiefly to meet the expense
of apparatus and materials, and not as remuneration                      for time or
labour bestowed           by the inquirer.      To  a less    extent appropriations
have    been made for like purposes to scientific                 institutions,    and,
more     rarely, to aid in the publication of valuable scientific results.
    "
       The distribution of the fund is not restricted to Fellows of the
Royal      Society, nor have they any privilege             in regard     to  it ; men
of science, whether          belonging     to the Society or not, and where-
ever    they may carry on their researches,               in this country or the
colonies, have an equal title            to participate,    and their claims have
 been    in all cases equally recognised.
     "
       No part of the fund is applied towards the expenses of the
 Royal Society, and the Society neither asks                nor would accept any
  remuneration        for its stewardship.
     " It   is to be noted that, in 1864, the Council, finding that the
  unappropriated balance, together with other funds at their dis
  posal,   would      meet    the probable demands for           scientific    objects,
  repaid the grant       of that year into the Exchequer.
     "A    return was made to Parliament in 1855, stating the appli
  cation   of the fund for the five years ending 5th April 1855. This

  showing      the distribution of the fund from 1855                to 1862.       No
  later return has been          called for, although        the Council would be
  glad to    make   it if ordered.

304               Proceedings    of the Royal Society
    Dr Sharpey,   besides  drawing     out the foregoing memorandum,
explaining   the origin and objects    of this parliamentary grant,        has
been so obliging   as to send two printed returns,       giving for the first
twelve years the names      of the    persons   who have shared in the
grant, and the nature of the researches        aided.     Besides these     re
turns (to Parliament), he has sent a      statement — apparently not yet
published —containing similar information for the years 1869 and
1870.     For the years from  1862 to 1869, no information          is given,
except that in the year 1864,      as the memorandum          mentions, the
remarkable circumstance occurred, of the Society having paid back
to Government the L.1000,     in  consequence     of there being   no claims
on it which could not be otherwise met.
    Now, no one who looks at the returns showing how these annual
grants were expended, will question the judicious             and   impartial
manner in which they have been administered.              I would, however,
venture to remark, that as the grant was intended to assist scien
tific researches  in all parts of her Majesty's        dominions, colonies
included, some means      should have been taken to make the exist
ence   and the objects of the grant        publicly known. The grant
would, of course, be known to       the Fellows of the Royal Society of
London, but it has remained ever since its institution,          now twenty
years   ago, generally unknown to men       of science, and especially to
persons resident in Scotland and Ireland.              It is therefore not
surprising that, in the year 1864, there being no demands on the
grant, it had to be paid back to Government;            and that out of the
L. 14,000   embraced  by the returns, no more than L.610 should have
been expended on researches      in Scotland.      The great part of these
researches   was made by two individuals,        both of them Fellows of
the Royal Society of London.
    It appears to me that, so far as the interests       of science   in Scot
land are concerned, these interests,       if intended to be aided by          a
pecuniary grant from the State, would be better promoted were
the grant    administered   by a suitable board in Scotland, instead
of by   one  in London.     Any    researches   and experiments        carried
on in Scotland, and the scientific character of the men who carry
them on, must surely be better known in Edinburgh than in Lon
don. Limited as are my own opportunities of knowing of such
researches   and  experiments,    I may refer    to some on the       difficult

                            of Edinburgh,         Session 1870-71.                                 305
and      important subject             of    ozone, which,          after being carried on for
some time           in the Edinburgh Botanic                       Garden last year,* had to
be    discontinued on account of the want of apparatus and instru
ments        which     those who instituted               them had no means of paying
for.f
     I certainly do not wish, however, that the grant of L.1000,
which is at  the disposal of the Royal Society of London, should
be split up, so that a part of it may be administered to a Scotch
Society, if the London Royal Society think that they can apply
it all   usefully in England.                  All   that      I    contend for       is,   that when
parliamentary           grants         are   voted for aiding             scientific        researches
throughout the United Kingdom,                       it   is   not   a   judicious arrangement
for the        object in view to place               these grants at the exclusive dis
posal    of a society in London, when there are societies in Scotland
and      in Ireland competent to be intrusted with the duty.                                  A   com
mittee     of the Royal Society of London are also intrusted with
the      administration of the still larger parliamentary grant of
L.10,000 a year for meteorological purposes, —                                a   considerable part
of which            grant   is   devoted to the obtaining                of meteorological          re
turns        from     Scotland,        and of establishing               self-recording        instru
ments in            Scotland,      besides     upholding            other stations.          Our own
Royal        Society     has      from time to time done                  a   good    deal to pro
mote meteorology in Scotland,                    — Sir David Brewster, Sir Thomas
M. Brisbane,            and      Principal      Forbes,        having      been      distinguished
meteorologists,             and published largely in our Transactions.                          There
is    also          society in Scotland           specially devoted               to that science,
             is a
which           allowed to        be   doing useful work.              Yet neither society          has
 any voice          in the administration            of that large grant of L.10,000                 a
 year.

     t The test papers for ozone indications are affected by the varying force of
 wind, as also by the varying humidity of the atmosphere,       insomuch that at
 several Observatories ozone observations     have been discontinued.     When                       I
 was at Rome last winter, Padre Secchi told me he had ceased to take notice
 of ozone for these reasons, not having been able to devise any method for
 eliminating the effects of wind and moisture. The object of tho experiments
 in  the Edinburgh Botanic Garden was to construct an apparatus which should
 allow nnlv 'lry air to reach the test papers, and in certain quantities.

 306                     Proceedings     of the Royal Society
  dient that the board          intrusted   with     the   expenditure       in Scotland
 should be in Edinburgh rather than in London, is it not also a slur
 on Scotch scientific societies that they should be altogether ignored,
  and a London          society selected,    as   if   the   former were unworthy,
 or could not be trusted ?
      I  therefore regret this system of centralisation                in London, and
 cannot        help thinking that our Society ought                 not so tacitly       to
 acquiesce        in it.    In one of his       addresses       from    this   chair,  Sir
 David Brewster, in alluding to the annual grant of L.1000, as well
 as the       two royal      medals, placed        at   the disposal of the Royal
  Society of London,           expressed his belief         " that   an earnest     repre
 sentation made to the Government would obtain for us a similar,
                                                "
 though probably a smaller grant              ;     and    it humbly     appears    to me
 that such a representation ought to be made without farther delay.
     The expediency of energetic action               on our part is more manifest
 because        of  a   proposal    made   lately in an influential quarter to
 enlarge the amount of the grant to the Royal Society of London.
 Professor        Balfour Stewart      a few weeks ago, at the inauguration             of
 Owen's College,          Manchester, in his opening address               there, made
 the following remarks : —
     "  If  Government be disposed to grant pecuniary aid to physical researches,
 an extension of the allowance made annually to the Government Grant Com
 mittee of the Royal Society, would be a very legitimate way of accomplishing
 this object. No one can doubt that the small sum of L.1000 annually intrusted
 by Government to that Society for miscellaneous experiments is administered
 in a praiseworthy manner; and if the Government would be ready to grant,
 and the Royal Society willing to undertake, an extension          of this trust, it would
 be a great point gained." *
     This suggestion will           no doubt     obtain      consideration      from the
  Royal      Commissioners appointed to report whether the State now
 gives enough for the encouragement of science.                        All    or most   of
 these commissioners are            Fellows of the Royal Society of London,
 and two of them are            office-bearers of the Society.           A fairer selec
 tion of eminent men for the object in view could not have been
 made      ; and though none of them are Fellows of the Royal Society
of Edinburgh,          I  am sure that they     will not     on that account be less

of these Royal Commissioners,                I entertain    a very sanguine hope

tion    and   acknowledgment,            that the patronage      hitherto     given in
this country      to science is not what it should have been, and that
reform in     this   respect    is quite as much needed as         in other matters.
We       have been       lately     confessing     our   shortcomings       as regards
national schools, and are endeavouring                 to  remedy these       ;  but we
ought not to be satisfied with merely teaching old truths and well-
known      facts.     The investigation of new truths and new facts, and
the    opening out of new pathways in the wide field of knowledge,
are also    necessary      if  we are to help in extending          civilisation,   and
 if  we are     to uphold our position            in the family of nations.            It
should     no longer be left to the chance of individuals being found
to   carry on, from their own resources,             the great and noble work of
 making fresh discoveries in science and art.                 That work is worthy
 of State patronage, as           it also more than ever        needs    State assist
 ance ;   and unless that work is carried on energetically and success
 fully, we shall lose caste as an enlightened                  people,   and    see  the
 chief sources of our prosperity and power dried up.
     Therefore    I  look forward, with no small anxiety, to the report
 of these    Royal Commissioners.            But  I confidently   anticipate favour
 able   results  ; and    in pointing out the best channels through which
 aid to science from the State may flow,                 I  have no doubt that our
  own past     services, and our present efficiency as a society, will not
  be   overlooked.
      In these expectations            I   may possibly be over-sanguine,           and
  therefore allow me to add, in conclusion, a single remark as to our
  own duty in this matter           : — As  a society, and     so far as our scanty
  funds enable us, we         will continue    to encourage scientific researches
   in Scotland, not forgetting,            however, that we have also literary
  objects ; and as     Fellows of the Society, — a Society which during its
   time has   done much in the cause of science, and something too
  on behalf    of literature, we will do what we can to uphold its repu
   tation, and extend its influence and usefulness.

                            By Professor Tait.
   In  a paper   presented to the Society in 1867-8            I deduced from
certain hypothetical considerations regarding Dissipation of Energy
results connected with        the thermal and electric conductivity             of
bodies, the electric convection of heat, &c.          As   these were    all of  a
confessedly somewhat speculative character,            I printed at the time
only that connected with thermal conductivity,               which   I  had the
means of comparing with experiment, and which seemed                   to accord
fairly with Forbes' experimental results.            But  the assumption on
which this was based was essentially involved in all the other por
tions of the paper.
   With    a view to the testing of my hypothetical result as to electric
convection of heat, several of my students, especially Messrs May
and Straker, last summer made a careful determination               of the elec
tromotive force in various thermo-electric           circuits through        wide
ranges of temperature.          Their results for     a standard     iron-wire,
connected successively with two very different specimens of copper,
when plotted, showed curves so closely resembling parabolas that                 I
was led to look over my former investigations          and determine what,
on my hypothetical      reasoning, the curves should be.            This   I  had
entirely omitted to do.       I  easily found that the parabola ought, on
my hypothesis, to      be  the curve in every case, and           I  made    last
August     a numerous and careful set        of determinations with Kew
standard mercurial thermometers as an additional verification.

                         of Edinburgh,                Session            1870-71.                            309
   My hypothetical result                     was to the effect                   that    what Thomson
(Trans.     R.S.E.       1854,      Phil. Trans. 1856) calls the specific heat of
electricity,      should     he,    like thermal              and electric resistance, directly
proportional         in pure metals to the absolute temperature, the                                       coeffi
cient of proportionality being, for some substances, negative.
   Hence, using Thomson's                         notation      as      in Trans. R.S.E.,              we have
for any two metals
                                    J   <r,   -   £,< ,   J   a~t
                                                                    =      kj ,
where kl and kt are constants, whose sign as well as value depends
on the      properties       of each metal,                                 are the specific heats                of
                         J

electricity, and             is   Joule's Equivalent.
      Thus, introducing these values into Thomson's formulae, we have
where     II     is the Peltier effect                at a     junction           at   absolute tempera
ture (.      Integrating,           we have
                                        0                            =     J°t
                                    Jj
 or
                                                                           -9,
 where   is the constant of integration, obviously in this case the
            <0
 temperature at which the two metals are thermo-electrically neutral
 to one another.             Hence the Peltier effect                         may be represented                  by
 the ordinates        of   a parabola         of which temperatures                      are the abscissae            ;
 the ordinates         being parallel to the axis of the curve.
      The electromotive             force in a circuit whose junctions                               are at ab

  This, of course,         is     again the equation of                  a   parabola.          That   t    -    t'   is

 a factor.     But it    was not     till the experiments iu my Laboratory
 had been       carried   on   for some mouths         that   I    was  referred   by
Thomson        to a paper by Avenarius        (Pogg. Ann. 119), in which         it is
experimentally        proved (partly in contradiction           of an assertion of
Becquerel) that in a series of five different thermo-electric circuits
the   electro-motive      force can be very accurately expressed              by two
terms of the assumed series
                    B-   b(t   -g      +  eft' -<,«)+       •    •   .
where    t, and tt are   temperatures as shown by the ordinary mercurial
thermometer.          It follows from this that (neglecting the difference
between      absolute temperatures and those             given by the mercurial
thermometer)        E  has no other variable factor than those above given.
   Curiously enough, Avenarius,             whose paper seems to have been
written     mainly for the purpose of attempting               to explain    (by the
consideration merely of the effect of heat on electricity of contact
of two metals)       the production      of thermo-electric      currents, does not
allude to the fact that the above equation represents a parabola.
In fact     he   gives several figures, in all of which it is represented
as a very accurately drawn semicircle.             He   makes no application       of
his empirical       formula    to the determination        of the amount of the
Peltier    effect, nor does he seem to recognise the existence              of what
Le Roux       has called
                             " l'effet Thomson," which is
                                                                   indispensable to
the explanation of the observed phenomena.
   All  the curves plotted by Messrs May and Straker, which were
derived from iron, copper, and platinum               alone, as well as my own,
which included cadmium, zinc, tin, lead, brass, silver, and various
other substances       (sometimes arranged with a double arc of two dif
ferent metals connecting the hot and cold junctions) were excellent
parabolas.       When the temperatures           were   very high, the parabola
was  slightly     steeper   on the hotter than on the colder side.             This,
however, was a deviation of very small amount, and quite within
the limits of error introduced by the altered resistance of the cir
cuit at the hotter parts, the deviations of the mercury thermometers
from absolute temperature, and the non-correction of the indication
of the thermometers for the long column of mercury not immersed
in the hot oil round the junction.
   To settle     the question rigorously,      I  have been for some time ex

perimenting with an arrangement               sometimes of double metallic
arcs,  sometimes of two separate thermo-electric            circuits acting on a
differential galvanometer — a         second object being to obtain,       if it be
possible, an arrangement capable           of replacing with sufficient      accu
racy the air-thermometer          in the measurement of very high tempera
tures,   and where very exact results are not required.
    In fact,     if the formula above be correct, we have for two circuits
with their      junctions immersed in the      same vessels
so   that    if the   resistances in the circuits    be made    as o to a' their
resultant effect on the differential galvanometer          will  be proportional
to
    It is obvious that       so far as these factors are concerned the most
sensitive      arrangements will be such        as have   their neutral points
 farthest     apart.     On a future occasion    I  hope  to lay the results     of
 my new       experiments     before the Society.     They   appear   to promise
 to be    of great use in furnishing an easily working             and approxi
 mately accurate substitute for the air-thermometer in an inquiry on
 which     I  am engaged respecting specific heats and           melting points
 of various igneous rocks, &c., while         the comparison of the indica
 tions   of two such arrangements at very high temperatures will
 give the      means of determining        whether the quantities        called k
 above are      really constants.
 3.   Note on        Linear Differential Equations           in Quaternions.
                                By Professor Tait.
     The generally non-commutative           character of quaternion multi
 plication     introduces into the solution even of linear           differential
 liquations with        constant (quaternion) coefficients, difficulties of a
 somewhat       novel character.     To  some of  these which have presented
 themselves to me         in many investigations,    I wish to draw attention
  in the  following note, but want of leisure prevents my attempting
 at  present either to classify the numerous curious forms which may
  be met    with in physical inquiries, even when these lead to mere
     vol. VII.                                                        2 s

312                  Proceedings of         the    Royal Society
vector equations of an order no higher than the second, or to de-
velope     the subject of the curious functional equations which are
incidentally     involved.
     1.  The integration of an equation such as
                                q + mq       =   a   ,
where m is a scalar (usually             a function            of  t,   which is assumed
throughout as the independent variable), and                        q an   unknown qua
ternion, is obviously to be effected             by the ordinary method,            multi
plication by      «/md'.
     2. But   if o be a quaternion,      the integration of
                                    q + aq       =    a',
even      when   a is constant, requires a              little   care, unless we    boldly
treat a as m was treated in the preceding section.                         This, no doubt,
gives the correct result, but the process                     requires to be defended.
Assume therefore         r to be a factor which makes the left hand mem
ber integrable.         Then we must have
                                        r = ra        ,
 or,  if r' be a proximate value of r,
                           r' =  r  + rSt    =    r  (1 + aSt)        .
 Hence, dividing the finite interval              <  into    a   great number of equal
 parts, and taking the        limit
 where r0 is an arbitrary but constant quaternion.
     Now we have
                                             -     t(m + na)
                                                                >
                                                                  suppose
                                      -   t
                                            mt
                                               a
                                                  t
 Hence the solution of the given equation is

the     arbitrary quaternion constant                    ru     having disappeared,                    but   a new
one being       introduced by the integration on the right.
   When a is variable, the tensor of                             r is easily              seen to be
but its vereor,         »,   is to be found from the equation
                                             i    =      sVa
the     fundamental           relation between             the instantaneous axis and the
versor    of rotation of         a   rigid body (Trans. R.S.E.,                           1868).
  When r is a vector, 6 suppose, we have
                                            6 =       Y6a        ,
whence,       as above,
                                           6 =    V^/"*              .
  2.     In the succeeding examples                      we restrict ourselves to equations
for the   determination of unknown                        vectors, as we thus avoid the in
troduction       of the quartic             equation which                          has    been        shown by
Hamilton        to be satisfied by               a       linear          function          of    a   quaternion.
This would appear,              for instance, in the solution of even the simple
equation
                                            ^ +   aqb = c
where a       and   b   are constant quaternions                     ;   though, of course, its use
may be avoided                by employing           a    somewhat more cumbrous pro
cess.
  4.     Suppose we have

coincidence is so far a justification                   of the use of the method of
separation of symbols.

sarily equimultiples                 of) the displacements in these directions. The

one line.

the potentials of given distributions of matter. And the substitution
of functions of       t   for those of           P gives    us, by means                of   the general

     5.   Note on an Ice Calorimeter.                               By Dr A. Crum Brown.
     The principal           upon which this calorimeter                              is founded         is,   that   a
contraction         of   a definite         amount takes place on the conversion of
ice at 0°      C. into water at 0° C., and that                          a    definite amount of heat
is   required       for this conversion.                  Early in the year                     1866    I      sent   a
description and drawing of the instrument to Messrs Kemp                                                       &   Co.,
instrument-makers here,                      with     an      order to                have   it     constructed.
Some       mechanical difficulties occurred which prevented its comple
tion      at the time.        I       should not have laid before the Society an
account of an unfinished                      instrument                were       it   not that Professor
BuDsen         has       recently       published
                                                          *     an account                 of   a   calorimeter
founded on the same                    principle.           The two instruments                          are quite
different in detail, and are primarily intended for different pur
poses — Professor Bunsen's for the estimation of specific heat, and
mine for the estimation                      of     the    heat produced during                          chemical
changes.
     While, of course, fully acknowledging Professor Bunsen's priority,

myself the       right to use my own instrument.
     It    consists of    cylindrical vessel
                             a                                     A,

with      a tightly-fighting flanged lid of conical form. This  a   fixed                                 is
to the      corresponding flange on the calorimeter by means of binding
screws, and          has     a   small hole at its apex, which can be completely
closed        by   means     of   a   screw D.
     Within the calorimeter                  is   contained         a        smaller cylindrical vessel
B,    the laboratory,            closed above        by means of                  a   flanged lid.         Into       it
open two           tubes,    EE       and    FF.          One      of    these,       EE, carries         a     small
plate, upon          which apparatus may be placed.                                   From the bottom of
the       laboratory     a   tube, GGG, passes, spirally bent in its descending
part, and          having    a    reservoir with          a   stop-cock between its descend
ing and ascending parts.                     All    these tubes pass                    tightly through the
lid of the         calorimeter.
     The whole apparatus                is   enclosed         in   an outer cylinder CC.
      The doubly bent glass                  tube    II connects the vessel                     K       within     the
calorimeter, and             the vessel     J       without.             It       passes through          a     tight
stuffing-box in the wall of the calorimeter, and through                                            a   perforated

cork in the wall of the vessel C  ;  it is formed of two pieces, which
can  be disconnected at     L, so as to allow of the removal of the
calorimeter from the jacket.    The calorimeter A is    to be filled  with
ice and water, both free from air    ;  the tubes   EE  and   FF   supply
the  gases (previously cooled   to 0° C.) necessary    for the chemical
 operation taking place in the laboratory B     ; while GG removes the
 products of combustion, those      which    condense  collecting   in H.
 The vessels  J and K   contain mercury, and it is obvious that the
 quantity of mercury transferred from the one to the other is the
 measure  of the thermal change accompanying the chemical action.
 The  space between   the calorimeter and the jacket C is filled with
 melting ice.

Prussia."
    Mr President             and       Gentlemen,     — If     I   were    addressing almost
any other         assembly,        I   should probably begin by saying that the
subject of the educational                   system    of Prussia possesses a peculiar
interest at the present moment for two reasons                             — 1st, Because          the
wonderful          successes   of Prussia make            one curious        to know all the
methods which              have been applied to bring that nation to its pre
sent state ;           2dly, Because public instruction is just now one of the
chief questions            of the day for       the inhabitants          of Great Britain          and
Ireland.
    But     in this Society considerations                   of    the    temporary and the
contingent         would be out of place.               And therefore, omitting                alto
gether such allusions,                 I propose    to submit       some account and            esti
mate      of     the Prussian           educational      system          merely   as       a sort of
contribution            to human natural history.
    Probably no human institution is perfect, and yet                                  I   think    we
may       see     nature working in and by means of human societies
towards         constant improvement — that towards the best. While
                                                             is,

  without any desire for progress,      there have always been progressive
  races   who have respectively devoted themselves to working out
  different problems of civilisation.        Among these is the problem of
  national education, for the working out of which Prussia has made
  great, and, as it is generally thought, successful efforts. At all
  events, she has accumulated so great a mass        of experience on the sub
  ject, as to make the history of her efforts worthy of being studied.
     It  is a common, but erroneous, notion to suppose           that education
  in Prussia     is the product of the arbitrary will of modern despotic
  governments      — that it  was conceived as a whole by some         Minister
  of Instruction, drawn out on the foolscap paper of a bureau, and
  then issued by the fiat of the State to be accepted by the people.
  Such an account would be as far as possible from historical             truth.
  But   some notion     of the kind  has obtained currency, perhaps       partly
 under the authority         of M. Cousin, who visited Prussia in 1831,
 and made a report on the state of education there for the French
 Government.          His account of the primary educational system was
 translated by Mrs Austin, and so became tolerably well known in
 this country.        M. Cousin got hold of   a scheme for the organisation
 of education throughout Prussia, which had been drawn up in
 1819 by Von Altenstein, then Minister of Instruction.                 Viewing
 matters rather superficially,        Cousin   referred all he saw to this
 scheme,     as if it had been the cause and origin of the school system
 which he found.         But  the fact is that Von    Altenstein's document
 was    merely what we would call a "draft             bill."    It  was  never
 carried in the Chambers, and never became                law, and   it had  no
 more influence on education in Prussia than the several abortive
 bills for education in Scotland have had         on our parochial      schools.
 The curious thing is that Prussia, up        to the present day, has never
 had a substantive Educational        Act.   Several bills have been drawn
 up, as for instance in 1819, in 1850,         and  in   1869, but they have
 always been ultimately rejected.           And the Liberals in Germany
 are  looking forward       to the actual passing    of  an educational    law,
 after more than fifty years of unsuccessful attempts at legislation
in this department,        as one of the first internal     results which   will
be achieved after the conclusion        of the present war.
    It is true that the administration of public instruction in Prussia
is  bureaucratic in the extreme ; but this is not the same as saying

that the educational                 system has been created                    in   a bureau.           The
schools grew up                  in accordance with the             ideas   of the          people   ;   the
character of the schools has been modified from time to time by
public     opinion      ;    till within the last sixteen years the schools varied
according        to the difference of the different provinces                         ;    in short, the
central Government                  has only gradually and lately got its grasp on
that which        it found, but did not               create.
  The Volksschulen,                 or people's schools, in Prussia                        were    in the
outset a product                     The great characteristic of
                             of the Reformation.
Prussian popular education is universality of school attendance
under legal compulsion.  Now, the legal compulsion is of com
paratively        late introduction.                 It   was    only brought              in after the
sending     of children to school had long                      been recognised as a religious
duty incumbent               on all, and had thoroughly                become         a habit      of the
people.          Just       as    John Knox           was    the author          of the parochial
school system           of Scotland,            so   Martin Luther          was       the author of
the    universal        school attendance of Germany.                           The custom           dates
from a   circular letter which, in the year 1524, Luther addressed to
the   burgomasters and councillors of all the towns in Germany.    It
was a      manly, earnest, powerful appeal, painting                             in strong colours
the    neglected condition                 of   the children, and urging                   that schools
should      be    provided           Luther pleaded that each child
                                    for them.
should go to school for at least two hours a day, giving the rest of
its time, if absolutely necessary, to work. This letter had a striking
and    permanent effect.               The town councils, the landowners, and the
princes      of Germany             were    stirred up to action            j    new schools were
provided,        and the old ones improved all over the country, and the
people gradually             took up the idea and never dropt                        it,   that to send
their children to school was                    a   plain Christian duty.
      At   the    beginning          of the eighteenth              century,         in    1716,     King
Frederick William, issuing certain ordinances for the regulation of
schools, assumes             the universal attendance of unconfirmed persons                              ;
he     merely gives his royal sanction to an existing practice.                                          In
1763       an AUgemeines Landachulreglement,                       or general regulation for
country schools, was issued, which for the first time defined the
age    of school attendance, namely, from five to fourteen.                                    Thus the
law was merely an expression,                         a   ratification,     and      a     definition of
the custom         of the people.

      I will   now mention the way in which the compulsion                                             is carried
out.      Compulsory school attendance may be of two kinds                                              — either
(1) the parent may be obliged to show that the child is taught
somewhere ; or (2) the child may be compelled to attend a parti
cular school for which it is registered. The second   of course,                                is,
the harsher and more bureaucratic method, and                                        it    is   distinctively
called Schuhwang, or school compulsion                          ;     while the first and milder
obligation         is   Schulpflichtichkeit, or school duty.                    The        second method,
while leaving less liberty to the parent,                                    more efficient from the
                                               and as such           it is                            in Prussia
point of view of the State                 ;                                 was adopted
in 1857, and             is   now the law of the kingdom.                           The police-office of
each place makes out                 a   list of children       as they arrive at school age
— that is, five years old.                     It   registers each child for the school
nearest its dwelling-place,                    and sends the list to the school board,
which now becomes                    responsible for the child not only joining the
school, but also regularly attending for the next eight years                                              — that
is,   up to the time of its confirmation.                       The master keeps                      a   register
of attendances, and in some places                         it   is   the custom, after the first
school hour, to send                 round     a    messenger to inquire                    after missing
children and the reason of their absence.   Each case of absence                                                  is
                          "         "     "
marked by the master as excused or unexcused."           When un
excused absences occur,                  it    becomes     the duty            of    the    clergyman, as
chairman of the school board, or of some deputed                                           member of the
board,    to use moral suasion with                    the parent or guardian, with                             the
view of obtaining                 greater regularity.                If      these       means         fail,    the
name     of    the parent or guardian                is    sent to the police-office, and he
is    mulcted with            a   small fine for each unexcused absence, and,                                    in
case     of non-payment,     sent to gaol.
                                      is   Mr Mark Pattison (from
whose      admirable report on the primary schools of Germany most
of my details for this part of the subject                            are taken) mentions                      that
in Berlin, in the year 1856, there were                               1780 convictions for                     irre
gular attendance, being rather more than three per cent. on the
whole number of children                       on the rolls of the schools.                            This was
thought        a   very large proportion, and was attributed to the growth
of pauperism, and consequent demoralisation                                         in   a large city.          I
am sorry that           I     have    not more recent statistics to offer, but the
system     remains the same, and                 I    think that             we can see           its general
working.

                    of Edinburgh,       Session 1870-71.                      313
    In  that same year, 1856, there were 2,943,251 children             of school
age    in all the Prussian provinces.           Of these, 2,828,692      were    in
attendance      at elementary      schools, public      and private.       Of  the
remainder,     114,559, many were in attendance at the lower classes
of grammar       schools and real schools, which are open to pupils of
nine years     of  age  ; others were being educated at home             ;  a few
were    doubtless invalids,     or physically      or mentally    incapacitated     ;
the residue,     which must be small, represents the children of itine
rating    families  who    manage     to    escape   getting   upon any school
register.     Even  if we suppose that 100,000 children escaped school
attendance altogether, that would give less than three and                  a half
per cent.     on the entire population of school-going            age.   But the
proportion for most of the provinces is nothing like so large.                 Out
of the   recruits that joined the Prussian army during the past year,
it is true that exactly three and         a-half per cent. of the troops had
never had     any schooling.      But the great bulk of the unfavourable
returns is made up of recruits from Posen, a             Polish province which
has been     called "  the  Ireland of Prussia,"       and from the natives of
 East Prussia, whose      vicinity  to the frontier facilitates their evasion
 of school    attendance.     From     the province of Brandenburg,           only
 one-eighteenth     per cent. of the reciuits had not attended school.
    On the    whole, the law of compulsory attendance in Prussia may
 be  said to be perfectly efficacious      in producing     the  result at which
 it aims,  and it appears to be very seldom complained of.               Even in
 the  political disturbances of 1848, this law was not put forward as
 one    of the   grievances     against     the  Government.         The   law    is
 thoroughly    in harmony with popular custom             ; and  just  as in this
 country   it is  a matter   of  course for the well-to-do       classes to send
 their children without any exception to school, so in Germany                it  is
 equally a matter    of course for    the    peasant and the labourer to send
 off his  children every morning to the school which the community
 has   provided. Day schools throughout Germany (as in Edinburgh)
 are  the rule for rich and poor alike, and there is an air of equality
 given by    the spectacle of rich children, as well as poor, going off
 each day    to their respective schools.
     The Schulzwang, or compulsion to attend a particular               school, is
 of course    relaxed in favour of the rich.            The parent applies for
  exemption, stating his reasons, and naming the school (generally                 a

  314               Proceedings of        the Royal Society
 private one) to which his child is to be sent.             In some places he
 has to pay the school fee all the same to the school for which his
 child  was   registered.     In two parts of Germany there used to be
 no law of compulsion, namely, in the free towns of Hamburg                   and
 Frankfort-on-the-Maine.           Frankfort, however, has now become
 Prussian.     It  was    said that     in these places the attendance of
 children at school was quite as universal as in Prussia itself; and
 some persons     argue that the custom of the people might be relied
 on everywhere      in Germany, and the law dispensed with.              But we
 have already seen        that the growing         pauperism    of  places   like
 Berlin tends     to invalidate     the custom.       The law, at all events,
 helps to keep the custom straight, else it might well be doubted
 whether the ideas of the sixteenth century as to the duty of school
 attendance could be kept alive in manufacturing                centres, and in
 very poor neighbourhoods.           In the agricultural districts, it is said
 that the farmers dislike schools because they raise wages ; in
 manufacturing      districts, the parents dislike       schools because    they
 deprive them of     a  certain amount of wages          which their children
 might otherwise be earning.           In the cotton manufacturing districts
of Saxony, the Government              has made     an  equitable compromise
between    the claims of industry and of school learning, by allowing
a system of half-time       schools for children employed in the factories.
The children under this system              appear   to be ultimately   as  well
instructed as those      under a whole time system.           I think that this
experiment deserves       particular attention.        For I believe that chil
dren up to nine or ten years' old can learn as much in three hours
per diem as they could learn in six hours per diem, and that               light
industrial tasks for the remainder of the day would rather tend to
develope    the intelligence    of the child.      In Prussia the minimum
age for children     being employed in a factory is twelve, and up to
fourteen no child must work more than six hours per diem.                  Thus
plenty of time is still left for attendance at a three hours' school.
   We have now to consider the funds by which the elementary
schools of Prussia are supported. There are very few endowments
available for them.       The Government has at its disposal for educa
tional purposes     about L.50,000        per annum, derived from seques
trated Church property, and from charitable bequests.               But this   is
almost   entirely    devoted    to    higher   education.    The    elementary

                       of Edinburgh,         Session 1870-71.                       315
schools     may be said, in        a word,    to be supported       wholly by contri
butions from the annual income of the                 community, in the shape of
— 1st, school fees;         2d, local rate;     3d, general taxation.          Tbe first
step towards       providing for       the   maintenance of a Volksschule             is,
that the proper        authorities of the        gemeinde, or commune, register
each    family as assessed at a certain rate of school fees for any
children that may be of school-going age.                    In this country there
appears to be a sort of repugnance to the idea of a graded scale of
fees in proportion to the income of parents.                         But in Prussia
this is the   first principle of public instruction.              Fees are assessed
ujton   families   not   in  relation   to  the  cost  of the  school, but solely in
relation to the circumstances of those who are to pay the fees.
Government,         however,      fixes a maximum          and a minimum           rate.
No child is to pay more than fifteen thalers, or about forty-four
shillings per annum; and the lowest rate (from which there would
only be exemption in the case of extreme poverty) is one groschen,
that is about three halfpence,             per week.      Between these extremes
the assessment takes place.
     The next source of revenue for the school consists in the collec
 tions made      in  the parish church during one Sunday in each                   year.
 Then there is a small capitation tax on poor and rich alike, and,
 finally, a rating on property, estimated by a loose valuation.
     Grants from the general taxation of the country for elementary
 schools are     only   made in cases where the commune can show real
 inability, on account of the poverty of its inhabitants, to meet the
 necessary cost.       The Government, however, has occasionally allowed
 grants for increasing schoolmasters' salaries.               It  is clear, then, that
 as the fees    are almost always extremely low, the burden of main
  taining the primary          schools falls     mainly upon the rate-payers.
  This principle      was    introduced      by the AUgemeines          Landrecht,    or
  general   code     of Prussia      of   the    year 1794,      which     lays   down
  that   " where there       are   no   endowments for the support of the
  common schools, then the maintenance                 of the    teacher    falls upon
  the collective householders, without             distinction    of religion.      The
  contributions     requisite for this purpose, whether they be paid in
   money or kind, must be equitably divided among the householders,
   in the proportion of their property and holdings."
      To show the working of this system in a large city, it may bo

316                   Proceedings of          tfie   lioyal Society
mentioned that in Berlin (which has about three times the popu
lation of Edinburgh) there were some time ago about 55,000
children      in the elementary schools, and it was estimated that each
of these children, in addition to the school fees, cost the municipality
about   L.l    sterling per annum, — the total expenditure on this object
being about twelve per cent. on the municipal budget.
  We    have seen how the primary schools in Prussia are filled, and
how they are supported            ;   we have         now to inquire how they are
managed.        The    Volksschule      has     never forgotten the tradition              of
its origin,     at the time of the Reformation,                         as an ecclesiastical
institution.      The immediate          and         local      management of all the
schools is practically in the hands of the clergy.      The clergyman
of the parish is ex officio local inspector of the common school. He
is chairman of the school board, which consists of representatives
of the householders.            He    has really onerous               duties in connection
with the school.         He     is expected to            visit it constantly, in      some
places as often as once a week.                He     is not merely the         inspector of
                     of examiner and critic, but he is responsible
the school in the sense
for its management and superintendence.    He has to prepare the
children for confirmation by a religious lesson of at least an hour a
day for the two or three months preceding Easter.
   The central power is said to regard the clergy as useful in
repressing the instinct of self-government in the commune. The
clergy are said generally to take a bureaucratic and centralising
point of view in the discharge of their functions as school inspectors.
But they have          a difficult     and thankless                office.   They have    to
encounter the jealousy of the school board, and often the discontent
and mutiny       of the schoolmaster, who                    has,     perhaps, the chronic
grievance of an inadequate salary, and who, having been profes
sionally prepared in        a   training college, finds himself controlled by
one who has no technical              acquaintance with the details of school
management.
  In the political disturbances of 1818-49  ^which were designated
as " the schoolmasters' rebellion "), one of the great cries was for
the autonomy of schools, that                  is,   for greater freedom from the
control of the Church.            And this    of the things which the
                                                     is   one
Prussian      Liberals expect from the Educational Bill of the future.
They do not seem to ask for             a     secular system of instruction,              but

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                                          317
rather for emancipation                from clerical management.                  The Govern
ment depends            much on the moral influence of the clergy in pro
moting regular school attendance among the people, and generally
in    playing a conciliatory part in relation both to the school board
and     the master.             In many        cases     the clergy      appear     to      perform
these offices         in a most Christian and self-denying                    spirit.         But, on
the    other hand, they appear frequently to fall into a state of apathy
and     indifference          about    the schools.            Their labours,            as       school
inspectors, are an unremunerated addition to their proper functions,
and are       such as often, individually, they have no taste for.
     The present system is recommended by its cheapness,                                    as under
it school inspection            costs nothing to the Government.                    But, on the
whole,       it   can hardly be called successful, and                it is probably          doomed
to    alteration.        It   is not   only the clergy themselves, who in many
cases    exhibit       a want     of interest in         the schools, but the           local com
munities also have their sympathies chilled, in the first place, by
an     over predominance of the clergy in school management, and,
secondly,          by the excessive interference of bureaucratic action from
above.            The nature of this bureaucratic action                       has now            to    be
described.
      The kingdom of Prussia is divided into provinces, each province
into departments, each                 department into circles or districts,                        each
circle       into parishes or communes.                    For the whole kingdom, the
central           educational    authority       is,   of course, the minister of public
 worship, and medical             and educational             affairs.    Beneath him there
        gradually descending scale of officers, for the superintendence
is
a
 of instruction on the system that a civil authority                           is   always asso
ciated with clerical             or scholastic affairs.             Thus for      the     province,
 the president          of   the province      is   associated with      a   provincial           school
 council.  For the department, the prefect of the department                                             is
 associated with a departmental school councillor. For the circle
 or district, the landrath,              or district       councillor,    is   associated              with
 the     superintendent,          who     is     an    ecclesiastic      of about the              same
 dignity as an archdeacon                   in England, and who supervises the
 inspection          of schools in from twenty                 to forty    parishes.              In    the
 parish there          is    the school board          associated     with the local clergy
 man, who, as we have seen,                 is   ex officio   school inspector and school
 managt-r.

    The provincial school council, in conjunction            with the president
of the province, manages higher education alone.
    All reports    on primary instruction        are sent up by the superin
tendents of districts to the departmental school councillor,              who, in
conjunction      with the prefect of the department, forwards                them
direct to the minister of instruction.           The superintendent, though
an ecclesiastic, is said to       act invariably in a bureaucratic, and not
a clerical    spirit.   It  may easily be supposed          that, with all this
network      of reports radiating towards the centre, there is little
scope    left for local action in the matter of the common schools.
Though the rate-payers furnish the funds, they have little to say
on their expenditure.          The schoolmasters appear to be appointed,
not by the parish school boards, but in each case by the depart
mental school councillor.            For   some    time there was      a  certain
liberty left to individual masters          and to local feeling in the kind
of teaching to be given in the schools         ;  but, in 1854, certain famous
Regulative, or Minutes of the Bureau of Public Instruction, were
issued,    absolutely defining      the subjects and manner of teaching.
Of   these minutes     I  will  speak   presently.     They   gave final  extinc
tion to anything        like local    and  characteristic    life in connection
 with the country schools.
    In  large towns they have another board called the Schul-depu-
tation,   or school delegacy, for the collective           management of the
city schools.      These bodies were first created in 1808, when, under
Stein's advice, every possible means was being adopted for calling
 forth the energies of the nation, and, amongst other things,               it was
 thought desirable to awaken municipal life.              In Berlin, the school
delegacy, consisting of chosen          members of the town council, have
 the  management of all           the schools, both higher         and   primary,
 within the city, except       a few  which are of an exceptional character.
 But the school delegacy has to report to the provincial               council of
 Brandenburg, and Mr Pattison mentions that on one occasion they
 were   reproved for too much independence, for having examined
 some candidates as teachers         in needle-work without having sought
 the permission     of the provincial government.          In short, the central
 power has     of late evinced much jealousy of          the   school delegacies,
 and has apparently wished to take back, or neutralise, the dangerous
 concession    of  1808.

   In Prussia the so-called " religious difficulty "             has never existed.
The schools of every kind are religious and denominational.                      The
religious difficulty arises from a multiplicity of sects, and from
antagonism       between      established      and   non-established       churches.
But in Prussia       there are three leading confessions, all endowed
respectively     in different localities, which cover almost the entire
population,    — the Lutheran, the Reformed,             and the Catholic.       The
two first are conjoined for school purposes             ;  and thus we have the
denominational proportions of population                stated    some   little time
ago, as   follows : —
                Protestant              .           64-64 per cent.
                Catholic               .     .     32-71
                Other creeds-          .     .       2-65      ,,
    Of these     other creeds       five-sixths    were     Jews, the remainder
 Dissenters   —such     as Baptists,       Mennonites,     Irvingites, &c. This
phenomenon        of more than ninety-seven per cent. of the population
belonging     to established churches may remind us of the case of
Scotland,     where,    I   believe, about      eighty-eight      per cent. of the
population     belong, if not     to one establishment, at all events to one
confession, without material doctrinal differences.
    The Jews in Prussia, whenever congregated in sufficient numbers,
have schools      of their own, with their own religious teaching. If
 they   exist in isolated families, their children attend the Christian
schools,   and    are generally not withdrawn           even from the religious
 teaching.     They    are said to look on instruction           in Christianity as
 a piece  of useful or curious information,          and to be quite above the
fear of  conversion.       In this respect they      are  like  a certain Brahmin
of Bengal,    who, having attended a missionary school, reassured his
                                   "
caste by    telling them that         he had gone through the whole Bible,
 and  it had done him no harm."
    The Dissenters are obliged to attend the public schools, but they
 are  under the protection of a conscience clause.                 The authorities
 require  evidence that the children of Dissenters are taught religion
 according to their       own formulae       by their respective clergy.         The
 Prussian    constitution     of 1851 contained the following article             : —
 "
   In the ordering of public schools for the people, regard shall                   be
 had to  denominational        relations.      The religious instruction in       the
 people's   school    is under     the    conduct of the respective religious

320                   Proceedings                of the Royal Society
bodies."        The    conscience clause dates back from the                             Prussian
code of 1794, which                   lays down that
                                                     " admittance             into the public
schools shall not be refused to any one on the ground of diversity
of religious confession.                    Children     whom the laws of the               State
allow to be brought up in any other religion                           than that         which is
being taught in the public school, cannot be compelled to attend
the religious instruction given in the same."                         This    order,     however,
except in the numerically insignificant case of the Dissenters, appears
seldom to have been put in force.                       Mixed    schools,      where     teachers
of different confessions                   are   associated    together, have been tried
occasionally, but have not been found successful.          long been      It   has
an    established maxim in Prussia, that all schools must be denomi
national, and, as           a   rule, every child appears to find him or herself
at a school belonging to his or her religious denomination.
     The obstacles in the way of legislating for the instruction                           of the
people in this country arise in limine from differences of opinion
as to the       questions of religious                 teaching,      school management,
rating, and compulsory attendance.                        The    obstacles     in the way of
educational legislation                 in Prussia arise from differences of              opinion
as to the relation of Church and State to local communities.                                  But
in Prussia the difficulty is only about altering the character of a
system.   The system is there, and is complete enough in itself.
The only question               is,   Could not    a   better and freer system be intro
duced?   We have                    seen   how the Prussian         people,     following the
advice of Luther, adopted universal school attendance as                             a   national
habit   ;   how this habit was ratified and confirmed by law in the
eighteenth century              ;   how the support of people's schools was thrown
on the      householders by the code of 1794                    ;   and   how, by common
consent, and          by    law, the schools have remained denominational,
with    a   conscience clause for the benefit of      very small section of
                                                                 a
the    population.          Thus has Prussia, in the march of time, quietly
stepped      over     all       those       preliminary       and merely       parliamentary
difficulties,   which in this country                   have    so long     prevented large
numbers of the people from getting                        any school education at all,
while Lords and Commons have been wrangling as to the exact
form under which the schools were to be started.
   But all this touches merely the external politics of public
instruction. The question remains, What    the teaching in the   is

                        oj Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                              321
people's school when you have got                it established    ?    On this point
the experience         of Prussia is not uninteresting.              The elementary
school     in Prussia was, in its origin, a catechetical instruction ; it
was a      repetition     by some subordinate ecclesiastic of the Sunday
catechising of the pastor.            Gradually      the teaching of reading and
singing was added, but only as            a means      to a religious end, namely,
reading the Bible and singing              in church.         By the middle of the
eighteenth century more secular elements of instruction were grafted
on; and Frederick           II.,  in 1763, orders that         "the people shall      be
Christianly brought up in reading, praying, chanting, writing and
arithmetic,        catechism, and Bible history.              The Prussian code of
1794 lays down that schools and universities are " institutions of
the State."          It prescribes the teaching of religion as a part of
useful knowledge,           and    as tending      to   make good       and   obedient
citizens.        At  the end of the last century the Prussian elementary
schools       appear to have       been easy-going         mechanical     institutions,
 with nothing          about them specially to call for remark.                 But   an
 immense ferment in relation to them was preparing,                      a passionate
 upstirring       of the whole question of popular education,                   endless
 theory and counter            theory, action and reaction, the history of
  which constitutes a whole literature, and the effects of which have
  all been felt upon the character of the Prussian                       Volksschulen,
  which      now remain like the fossilised              result and record       of the
  storms of the past.
     All this commotion         rose from the fervid         brain and heart of one
  man,   Henry Pestalozzi,        a  Swiss, who was born at Zurich in 1746.
  Pestalozzi was       a loving enthusiast     ;   of   a   most unpractical turn of
  mind   ;   always embarking         in visionary        schemes    for the good      of
  others   ;  of  a  large and noble heart, living a life of poverty and
  struggle     himself, but always spending his whole strength in efforts
  for the welfare      of the   poor.    He lived     to be eighty-one       years old,
  and   long      before   his   death he     had      been    publicly visited      and
  honoured       by emperors,      kings, and statesmen,          and had     seen    his
  ideas warmly        received    and widely spread           over the continent       of
  Europe.       Pestalozzi was much influenced in early youth by reading
  the  " Emile " of Rousseau.           In   1780     and    subsequent years, after
  many failures in life, he began to bring out books on education.
   The chief of these were,
                                    " The Evening Hour of a Hermit," con

 322                 Proceedings of     the Royal Society
 taining educational and religious aphorisms            ; and   " Leonard    and
 Gertrude," a story to illustrate what might be done by a particular
 method of teaching children.             These and other writings of his
 excited     great attention.       He had successively different       schools
 under his management, in which he developed his system by prac
tical experiment.          Finally, at Yverdun, in the year 1805, he had
obtained care of an         institution which has now become a classical
name in the history of pedagogy.
   Pestalozzi's      fundamental idea was that the children of the poor,
in  a  public school, should be taught as       if by an affectionate mother,
who entered into all their feelings, and anticipated their difficulties.
His conception was that primary instruction should not consist in
giving knowledge verbally, mechanically, or by rote, but in drawing
out the powers of the child.           He laid it down that no child should
be   taught      anything which it could not understand.              The first
development of this idea resulted in lessons upon form, number,
and     language.        At Yverdun,     Pestalozzi   would    carry his class
through      a lesson   of the following kind : — Pointing      to the wall, he
would say, —
   " Boys, what do you see ?"
                  " A hole in the wainscot."
   (Answer)
   "
       Very good ; now repeat after me —
      I
   " see a bole in the wainscot.
   " I see a
                 long hole in the wainscot.
   " Through the hole I see the wall.
      Through the long narrow hole I
   "                                          see the  wall.
   "  I  see figures on the paperbangings.
   "  I  see black figures on the paperbangings.
   "  I  see  round black figures on the paperhangings.
   "I see     a square   yellow figure on the paperhangings.
   " Beside the square yellow figure, I see a black round figure.
   " The square figure is joined to the round one by a thick black
stroke."       And so on.
   It   was said that Pestalozzi       used to shout out- sentences of this
kind without any explanation,           and   was echoed     in chorus by   the
class.     It  is true that words in this way became           associated with
impressions of       the sense.    But if this were all, we should say     that
Pestalozzi      was   incapable of developing his own theoretical         idea

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                                 323
A   trace of such teaching reached this country in the shape of the
so-called    " object lessons," which, without much fruit,                 were once in
vogue in     England.
    But the Festalozzian         method had in reality far greater results.
A swarm of enthusiastic              assistants, perhaps more clear-headed
than their master, came          to serve    under him        ;   and    by them there
was   worked out —
    (1.)   All  sorts of methods for conveying in an easy manner to the
child the arts of spelling, reading, ciphering,               and so on.
    (2.) The practice of a sort of Socratic dialogue, for developing
the intelligence of the class upon the subject of the lesson, what
ever    it might    be.
    (3.) The idea      of pedagogy     as a science, based upon psychological
data.
    (4.) The idea that religion,        which with Pestalozzi was made the
basis     of all, must not be taught dogmatically                  and confessionally,
but rather universally        ;  in short, that the first teachings             must be
of natural religion,      and not of the religion of any Church.
    All this     was  new, and     it had   a    peculiar fascination for several
of the greatest minds           of the    age.     When, in         1806,   Prussia   was
crushed      by     Napoleon,    and    went      through       afflictions   strikingly
analogous        to those that      have now befallen              France,    Stein   and
 Fichte, the statesman and             the philosopher,           both earnestly      pro
 claimed that the moral energies           of the nation must            be regenerated
 by the    universal adoption of the Pestalozzian                ideas.     Pestalozzian
 schools were established over the country, and                    in subsequent years
 the   system      was thoroughly      exploited     ;  all its strength and       weak
 ness    were brought to the full light of trial and experience.
     The result of fifty years' exhibition and discussion of the Pesta
 lozzian system has been as follows            : —
    (1.) There is a considerable residuum in the shape of excellent
 technical methods for teaching the elements of knowledge.                          Thus
 each     child is taught to read easily, alone, within twelve months.
 The old plan of first learning the names of the letters, and then
 spelling, is abandoned.           In arithmetic, the child            is taken through
  the   operations of the four rules, both             in integers and fractions in
  the tens,    before he reaches the hundreds.               The magnitudes         to be
  dealt   with form the only distinction            between     the classes     in arith

324                Proceedings     of the Royal Society
metic.     These and other methods are the result of the immense
attention which      has   been   bestowed    on the question       of primary
teaching.
   (2.) Public opinion has pronounced against much that was char
acteristic of the Pestalozzian system.           From the principle that
children should be taught nothing that they could not understand,
there was      deduced    the practice     of much abstract and formal
lecturing,   totally  unsuited to children from six to nine years of
age.    Thus, lessons on the theory of number were made to precede
empirical    teaching of arithmetic.        While much stilted talk           was
used both about the children and to the children,          it  was found that,
in many cases, they were suffered           to go through      school   without
learning to read and write.         A general reaction     set in against the
idea  of intellectual training in common schools.
   (3.) This tendency of public opinion was taken up               and   ratified
by the Government.         In October    1854, Regulative,   or Minutes from
the Office of Public Instruction in Berlin, were issued, which bear
a close  analogy in some points to the revised code of               Mr Lowe.
The object of these minutes was to restrict the teaching in elemen
tary schools to a few humble and necessary subjects,             and to ensure
these   subjects being efficiently      taught.    In direct opposition         to
Pestalozzi,    the Regulative proceeded       on the principle      that, in an
elementary school, it is not the           object to develope the child's
reasoning faculties, or to give him knowledge, but only to give him
the power    of doing certain things ; — Konnen, and not wissen, was
to be the result to be produced.         The schools were to turn out the
children in possession of the actual capacities (fertigkeiten) of reading,
writing, and ordinary ciphering, and everything outside of this range
was to be sternly excluded.        Thus   the children were on no account
to learn grammar, as this is an abstract, logical thing, suited to the
high school;       whereas,  in an elementary school, children            should
learn to use their own language correctly by practice, and not by
rules.    Even    mental arithmetic      was to be excluded,        as being     a
needless   fatigue of the brain.       Of secular subjects, in addition         to
the  three R-s, only singing        was as a general rule to be taught,
for the sake of practising       the voice and ear.      Only church       tunes
and national      songs were    to be permitted, the words        being previ
ously well studied and explained.            History   and    geography      were

discouraged        ;    if   taught at all, they must be limited to Heimaths-
kunde, or information about the child's native land.                           Drawing,    if in
troduced, must be confined to linear freehand copying from the flat.
   Religion remained an essential and prominent                               element for the
people's schools, but the Regulative made a great change                             in regard
to the mode             of imparting         it.     Under     the    Pestalozzian      system,
religion     had       been taught       not confessionally,           but universally; not
as a     matter of Church formulae,             but in a free and spiritual way,
which,     of   course,       depended   for its characteristics very much on the
individual master.               When the time for confirmation                   arrived, the
clergyman         would find the children furnished                    with ideas, more or
less    orthodox, of natural religion and of Christianity, but perhaps
never having            seen    the Church          Catechism,        and the labour would
devolve      on him          of making them learn this.                 It   appeared     to the
Government             that    the schools,         though      denominational          in their
foundation,        were too independent               of the Church in their religious
teaching.         The Regulative, by               one stroke, altered all this.           They
laid down        exactly what was to be taught in the shape of religion,
namely,      some       fifty hymns      were to be learnt            by heart, the whole of
the gospel        portions which are read              in the Lutheran churches            were
to be    committed to memory, and the Catechism (either Luther's or
the     Heidelberg) was to be learned off by rote, without any explana
tion.      All explanation of the doctrine contained in it                           was to be
reserved     for the pastor, when the time of confirmation drew nigh.
By these         rules, the relative positions of the clergyman                         and the
schoolmaster were completely subverted.                         All   the charm   of teaching
religion     to the children was taken away from the master, whose
task was,       in this respect, made              mechanical, while          he himself    was
made      completely subordinate to the clergyman.
   The minutes on religious teaching had, doubtless, a political                            and
ecclesiastical         motive, and       a    reaction against them is possibly in
preparation.            Those regulating the secular subjects in the people's
schools are a specimen of the Prussian Government, as a powerful de
cisive    will, proposing to itself certain definite              ends, and going straight
at these    ends without compromise or collateral considerations.
  In the         case    of the elementary schools, there                    can be no doubt
that the end aimed at is attained                      ;   for the schools embrace           the
entire population,             and   the result         is,   that the children       of every
  vox.,    vn.                                                                    2   y

 326                Proceedings of       the  Royal Society
 peasant    and   labourer     have,  as   a matter     of  course,    the arts   of
  reading, writing,    and cyphering, know the Church formulae and a
 good deal   of the Bible,      and can    take part in singing        a  hymn    or
 national chorus.
    But  I think that   one misses     in these schools anything calculated
 to raise the intelligence       of the   people,  anything analogous to the
 influence of the parochial schools of Scotland.               The repression of
 the high-flown       Pestalozzian     aspirations    has    been   too   absolute.
 The definition      of  an    elementary     school    has   been    too   logical.
 There is nothing to lead on towards the higher grades of education.
 The   people's   school seems sharply separated           off, and   to give the
 children   of the   people    no encouragement        or opportunity       to rise.
 One proof of this may be found in the fact that pupils who, at
 fourteen years of age,         have  passed     eight years in the        primary
 school, and who then have two years further               preparation under a
 public  schoolmaster     or clergyman,        are, at sixteen     years of age,
 commonly unfit to enter upon the very simple curriculum                     of the
 training college.
    It may be asked whether industrial           or technical instruction      does
not form part of the Prussian              system ?      But in the ordinary
 people's school nothing of this kind is attempted.                The Prussian
 Educational Department conceives that it has a particular function
to discharge for the people, and of this it acquits itself, and does
 no more.     It is argued that seven or eight         years' schooling, at the
rate of twenty-six      hours per week, is not more than sufficient for
imparting to all with certainty the elements of common knowledge
and religion, and that any attempt at technical               instruction    would
only interfere with this     ;   and everything     technical    must be learnt
practically, or otherwise, after the age of fourteen.             One means of
supplementing the meagre results of the people's schools, consists
in the Fort-bildungsanstalten,        or " improvement        schools."      These
exist generally     in the shape of evening classes            in mathematics,
French, &c., for youths and adults.           They have not      been organised
systematically,     and even      if they were, could hardly supply             the
want of a more early awakening of the intellect.
    But, of course, many children, and some even of the poor, quit
the elementary school at nine years of age, to enter on the course
of higher instruction.

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                              327
   In all the departments of higher instruction, Prussia seems to
me to be    distinctly ahead of England, and still more so of Scotland.
But   I  have already take up so much of your time, that            I must      now
confine    myself to a few aphorisms on this subject.                 In Prussia
education     is considered to be so completely a matter of national
concern, as always to call for the supervision of the State.               No man
may start      a private    school, whether primary, middle, or higher,
without a license from the educational office.             And this license is
only given after the passing of prescribed examinations.                   The too
common      charlatanry of private schoolmasters in England is thus
avoided.      A useful censorship of schoolbooks is exercised by the
minister of instruction.        By this the crotchets of schoolmasters in
the use    of eccentric   and useless books are checked.
    The minister     of instruction      is not only a man of science             or
learning himself, but he has the advice of councillors of the highest
scientific and literary reputation.          The opinions of such a central
board on questions       of higher instruction        are not merely        bureau
 cratic edicts, but constitute a valuable intellectual         guidance.
    With regard to       resources,    the following      distinction     is to be
 observed in Prussia.       The elementary schools get very little money
 from Government,       only   a small contribution      from school fees, and
 the great bulk    of their   expenses    from parish and municipal rating.
 The support of the higher          schools of all kinds       appear     to be as
 follows  :—
          From Fees,    a  proportion of            .        .         5'4
          From Municipal assignments,                                  2
          From Grants by Government,                         .         1-6
          From Endowments,                                             1"
    Thus the fees of scholars pay considerably more than half the
 cost   of the higher     schools.    Municipal contributions         amount to
 one-fifth,   and grants     from general taxation         to nearly one-fifth,
 endowments      to one-tenth.       Fees in    the high     schools are often
 remitted   wholly or partially on the ground of the circumstances of
 the parents.     Out of about 90,000 scholars attending the superior
 schools of Prussia,    about   20,000     appear  to be wholly     or    partially
 free scholars.
    The higher education goes in Prussia, the more entirely does it

328                 Proceedings    of the Royal Society
become recognised as a proper object for State maintenance.                     Tbo*
the universities, so far as their own resources fall short, are fully
supplied by the Government- The University of Berlin, in the rear
1864, had     an income of about L.30,000.            Of this, L.24 only          was
the interest of funded property of the University; L.1133 was tie
amount of entrance and examination fees           ;  L.28,842 was the grant
from Government.
    If  we compare    with this the University of Edinburgh, we find
the income for the current year to be L.20,351, of which L.4153
are fees of various kinds, L.9869 funds from private endowments
and other sources in the hands         of the Senatus, L.6329        parliamen
tary grants.     This  shows how comparatively small is the projtortion
of State assistance    to our University.
   The higher schools of Prussia consist of two distinct            branches —
the Gymnasien, or grammar schools, with their Pro-Gymnaskn,                        or
preparatory grammar schools, and the Real-schulen, or scientific
                       "                                " in
schools, with the        higher burgher schools               preparation for
them.     The Gymnasien      are, of course, the product        of  the Middle
Ages, the Renaissance, and the Reformation.                 The    Real-sehulen
sprang from the modern protest on behalf of science against                      the
predominant      claims of classics.      The Gymnasium is a first-rate
classical day school, with a      time-table of 30 hours per week. It
has six classes,    Prima being     the highest.      The 30 hours in Prima
are thus allotted:     — Religion, 2; German, 3; Latin, 8;             Greek, 6;
French, 2; History and Geography,             3 ; Mathematics, 4      ;   Physic*,
2.    Besides these    school hours there is extra-time         instruction       in
singing and gymnastics;         and   those   who propose     subsequently        to
study theology or philology in the University are required                 to learn
Hebrew, also in extra hours.
    The time-table, though thus definitely prescribed, is            not rigidly
 adhered   to ; for promising    pupils in the first class are          allowed    a
 good deal of liberty for private study in lieu of the stated lessons.
   Many enter     the Gymnasium irrespective        of an intention    to proceed
 to the  University, for the sake of the privileges which it            holds out.
 For,  those who have gone through the classes and passed the leaving
 examination, besides qualifying for the public service, are               allowed
to serve for one year as volunteers         in the army, instead of           three
years according to the ordinary course.

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                                                      329
     But yet it is endeavoured                 to keep       up     a    thoroughly intellectual
atmosphere         in the Gymnasieni-               The Prussian Government lays it
down that culture for its               own     sake, and           not with any premature
regard to the practical exigencies of life, is to be the object of these
schools. And it expressly forbids that those who propose to enter
tbe army as a profession, should abate any of the higher classical
studies of     the first class.         This is certainly very different from                                 the
principle adopted in English public schools.
   The crowning result, and the most distinctive                                      feature of the
Gymnasium           is    the     abiturienten-examen,              or leaving            examination.
The certificate of having                  passed       this examination                  is,   of course,
ardently desired by the pupils, as     the key to entry into any of
                                                    it   is
the learned professions, and gives important exemption in military
service.  This being the case,      may be affirmed that in this
                                                  it
country       an    analogous          examination            would           often      lead       to     over-
strenuous      preparation          on the part         of    the       pupils when the time of
the examination            drew nigh.           But the Prussian Government takes
the greatest care to obviate               a   result whicb they would deem utterly
unsatisfactory.            They lay down the strictest rules, both in general
terms and in detail, to prevent the examination being of                                        a   kind for
which any special preparation, spasmodic                            efforts, or cram would be
of any avail. It                  by
                       no means to turn
                            is                                      upon the             learning up of
numes,     dates,        and isolated facts         ;    but      it     is    to   exhibit          (as      the
educational        minute says)        "   the slowly ripened                 fruit of    a   regular and
contant industry throughout the whole school course."
  With this object, one of the grounds for the certificate                                          is    made
to consist in       a    record    of the pupil's work throughout perhaps the
nine previous        years in all the classes                of   the Gymnasium                 from sexta
to   prima.        In addition to this, the examination                             is    to show             how
much of the school study has really been assimilated                                       by     the pupil,
and has become part of himself.                         The Prussians               are    much wiser
 than some         other countries in the matter of examinations.                                         They
 always keep in view the exact end they are aiming                                            at.        In   the
 abiturienten-examen they don't want                     a    paper, but         a    man     ;     and they
 certainly adopt the best means                   of testing the man's real acquire
 ments and deserts, when, on the one hand, the examiners                                                   have
 before them        a    continuous        record       of his previous work for years,
 and, on the other hand, submit him to such general exercises in

330                       Proceedings of     the   Royal Society
languages and mathematics                as show in each subject what amount
of proficiency he has really available.                  The examiners consist of
the upper masters of the school itself, with certain commissioners
from the Government                associated   with     then.    Persons   who have
been brought up            in private high schools,        and   who wish to proceed
to the University, must present themselves at the examination                            of
the Gymnasium,             where   they will    be equitably examined.            But   on
the whole the public schools are most popular in Prussia, and the
scholars of private schools are quite in a minority.                        The paper
work of the examination occupies a week.                    The chief subjects          are
— (1.) An         essay    in German, which is intended to exhibit                general
culture, taste, and correct writing.               It   is analogous to the English
composition in the Indian Civil Service competition.        (2.)               A Latin
essay.    (3.) A      piece of simple Greek prose to be written.                 (4.) A
translation of German into French.                (5.) Two geometrical and two
arithmetical         problems      to   be solved.    A viva voce examination

     The certificate which          each candidate receives        is marked either
"insufficient," "sufficient," "good," or "excellent." The mark
"insufficient" is meant to indicate unripeness for the University.
The pupil receiving it is recommended to prolong his attendance
at school, or to seek some other career                 in life for which University
study is not required.    But if he and his parents wish        he may      it,
still enter the University, with his certificate of "unripeness."   In
that case he will be restricted to the faculty of philosophy, and not
allowed to enter any learned profession, unless he can, by subse
quently presenting      himself at the gymnasial examination, obtain
     certificate of being " ripe

    In all   these arrangements          of the leaving       examination    of high
schools, we see,       I   think, that Prussia         dares  to be thorough      in a
matter    of this kind.        She insists that high schools should do their
work, and by        giving the universities,         the public service, and the
learned professions an organic connection                  with  these   schools, she
makes    it  a very serious matter for         all the pupils to    take advantage
of their opportunities.             Without any apparent strain upon the
pupils, she succeeds         in obtaining a higher standard of results from
school boys than          is implied     in the ordinary       M.A.   degree   of the
Scotch     universities,       or the ordinary        B.A.   degree    of Oxford     or
Cambridge.
    Of the Real-schulen, or scientific schools,           I have not    much to say.
Started    originally more than         a hundred years ago,       it is only within
the   last fifty years that they have had            a  considerable development.
Of the 90,000 pupils             attendant on secondary schools in Prussia,
about 30,000 appear           to go to the Real-schulen or their preparatories.
These schools do not prepare for the universities,                 but for business,
certain    departments of the public service (such as architecture or
mining), and for the Polytechnic College.
    The time-table for Prima in a Real-schule consists of thirty-two
hours, made        up as follows      : — Religion,     2 ; German,     3 ; Latin,  3 ;
French, 4; English, 3; Geography and History, 3; Natural Sciences,
6 ;  Mathematics,        5 ;   Drawing,    3.   Latin, however, is not insisted
on,   and    a  liberty is left to the school delegacy of adjusting the
subjects    in some degree to the necessities of the immediate neigh
bourhood,      with reference either to particular             languages or parti
cular industries, that may exist.              A   suitable leaving examination
is prescribed,       qualifying the holders of certificates for military
exemption      and for the public service.
    An eminent        authority, Dr Jager, told Dr Matthew Arnold that
the Real-schulen were not considered successful institutions.                       He
said that the boys         in corresponding classes of the classical schools
beat the     Real-schule boys in subjects which both do alike, such as
 history, geography, German, and even                 French, on which the Real-
 schule boys      spend much more            time. Dr Jager assigned as the
 cause   for this result         that classical     training   strengthens    a  boy's
 mind more        than modern or scientific            teaching.    I confess,   how
 ever,  that   I   think the comparison,          as stated, not quite complete,

332                       Proceedings     of the, lioyal Society
as in matters not connected with language and history the Beal-
schule hoys       might        be found to have faculties               of observation           and
deduction to which the classical boys would be strangers.                               I merely
state what has been said.
      Turning now         to the universities  of Prussia, we find ourselves                       in
the region of pure            unfettered science.   The abiturienien-examen                        of
the classical schools gives the universities                      such   a   starting ground
in the thorough previous education of all the students who matri
culate, that they are able to commence the treatment of all subjects
on a high scientific level, in confidence that such a mode                              of    treat
ment will be followed and understood.
      The appointments of professors                  are invariably      made, so far as             I
can learn, on the grounds of greatest scientific                             eminence.          The
appointments are all in the hands of the Crown — that       of the                      is,
minister of instruction.  When    vacancy occurs, the faculty to
                                                  a
which the chair belongs sends up short leet of names to be recom
                                                  a
mended         to the     minister,   and from these            he generally        makes the
appointment.            ButI     believe that the name chosen                 is   always that
of the man whom previous public performances and general opinion
in the scientific world have designated for the place.                             I      believe
that anything like political or theological bias in the appointment
of professors        is   unheard of.    Other personal considerations (which
might     be more         plausibly   entertained) are also omitted, such as
power     of clear exposition            and      capacity       for managing           a     class.
Hence     it   may happen that the professor, when appointed,                       is    obscure
in style and unattractive as             a   lecturer    ;    but the students have,               at
all   events, the feeling that         in him they           have the greatest authority
that could be found on the particular                        subject.        And there        is   in
German universities             a   general consciousness that                it   is   better     to
have the       last and most reliable results in science than to have                              a
popular exposition             of what   is    old and perhaps exploded.                        The
professor has     a     fixed salary from Government, frequently amounting
to    L.350 or L.400       a   year, in addition to       a    share   of examination            fees
and the fees of his class.            But    he   is   bound to lecture free of -charge
twice    a   week.        The fees in theology or philosophy are about                          17s.
for the six months.              In the medical              classes   they go as high             as
L.l,    14s. 5d. for the course.          Several professors            have altogether            an
income of from L.1000 to L.1500                   a     year, which, in proportion                 to

ordinary rates of expenditure                   in Germany, is something consider
able.      We all know that the                  headmasters        of Eton and Rugby
realise L.4000 or L.5000 per annum, which                          is probably superior to
most university emoluments                    within the United Kingdom.                   But   no
thing of the kind occurs in Prussia                 ;    the highest schoolmasterships
are below,      both in rank and emolument, the ordinary run of professor
ships.   The best school appointment in Prussia appears to be the
rectorship of the Srhul-P/orta, an endowed gymnasium in Prussian
Saxony      ;   to    this L.300      per annum and a house are attached.                       The
professors, being            fairly   endowed    by Government, are far from being
sheltered from competition             kind of monopoly. The State
                                           by any
can always      appoint any eminent man as full professor, even in a
faculty     which has already its full complement.  Then, secondly,
the State       at its pleasure          appoints extraordinary           or assistant pro
fessors,    who have a small salary, their chief reliance being on fees.
Thirdly, the Faculties                appoint as Privat-docenten persons who can
prove      their fitness.         The Privat-docenten appear                not to fulfil the
functions       of what       we should call tutors, but rather to be analogous
to our      extra-academical            lecturers in the          Medical    Faculty.            The
Privat-docenten             and the extraordinary          professors     form a reserve of
men,     establishing their reputations, from whom the future full pro
fessors     will       be chosen.        Before the beginning             of the       session         a
harmonious            arrangement        is made        between     the professors,            extra
ordinary        professors, and Privat-docenten, in a Faculty, as to the
subjects on whicb each is to lecture, so as to cover                         the whole field
of instruction proper to the              Faculty.        The     dean then publishes the
programme,             and the only restriction             is that the         fees   must       be
uniform.
   There        is,   in short, absolute liberty of teaching to those who can
prove      their competent knowledge                    of any subject      ;     and there        is
 equal     liberty of learning,          for no student       is   obliged to attend any
 particular courses,           or number of lectures, with           a   view to his degree.
 All that general culture which we endeavour to ensure by our Arts
 curriculum           is   provided in Prussia      beforehand by the abiturienten-
 txamen,        and the student          is   considered fit to choose absolutely for
 himself his own            University curriculum.         In theprofessional Faculties
 he, of course, cannot dispense with instruction                         in all    the separate
 branches; but in the Faculty of Philosophy,                         which answers to our

Faculty of Arts, and           embraces the humanities and the                  mathematical
and natural sciences,          the student is allowed to choose any                   two sub
jects he likes for his final examination                  ;   and   if   he passes   in these,
he gets his degree as Doctor of Philosophy.                          To    pass,   however, in
any subject is supposed to imply, not a schoolboy preparation, but
a manly mastery of the whole subject.    For instance, in order to
pass in Greek and           Latin philology            a student would be called on               to
revise the readings in some Greek or Latin book, with scholarly
reasons for all his opinions on each point, and, in addition, to show,
viva    voce,    a complete knowledge of classical literature,                      philology,
and antiquities.           The liberty allowed to students is doubtless often
abused.         In   a   recent life of the Count von               Bismarck       it is men
tioned that, while attending the University of Berlin, he fought
innumerable duels, and only attended one lecture.   That lecture
was by the eminent Professor Savigny; but Bismarck, thinking
that he did not gain within the hour as much information as would
suit his purposes,          abandoned the course,             and applied himself to               a
repetitor       or crammer, by whose assistance he succeeded                        in passing
the examination of the Law Faculty.
   On the whole, there is probably not so much industry among the
students of a German as of                   a   Scotch University         ;   but there is far
more than at Oxford or Cambridge.                       And whenever industry            exists,
being based on more              complete previous preparation, and being in
relation to really scientific lectures, it is probably of a higher and
more     fruitful kind than           can    be found among the students of Great
Britain.
   Still, complaints            are      made     against     the Prussian           university
system.          One of these         is,   that the students are too exclusively
engaged in taking notes of lectures, and that they have too little
practice of their creative faculties.                   The prejudicial effects of this
may, perhaps,            be traced      in the want of the graces of style which
characterises to so great an extent most German books.
   Another complaint              is,    that the students, though systematically
prepared up to entrance into the university, are afterwards left
without sufficient guidance as to the order in which they should
take up successive           subjects.
   It   quite possible that Prussia, which honestly and thoroughly
        is
desires the best in education, may descend    little from the clouds
                                                                a

in its    university system, and deign              to adopt something        like the
Little-go or Moderations              examination     of the English universities,
though such an examination               in Prussia would         be,  of course, on a
distinctly higher level.             Prussia    might, perhaps, with advantage
curtail a little the liberty of her universities, and increase a little
the   liberty of her primary schools, in respect                 both of studies and
management.           She might         allow a more easy and natural connec
tion than appears         to exist     between the primary school and higher
education.         She would like also to         see   a gradual relaxing       of the
leading     strings of Government, and a greater development of cul
tivated local energies.           It  would be a great misfortune for the new
born German empire              if military   successes should be found to have
 intensified     the centralising      forces in   all the affairs of national life.
 The Liberals appear sanguine that this                will not    be the case.     But
 a  struggle on questions of internal             policy may very likely succeed
 the   conflicts of the war.          In   the meanwhile,        on   the educational
 question Germany            and    England hold positions the very opposite
 of each other.        In Germany there is          the   idea   of what is wanted,
 and a    universal     carrying       out of that idea.        But   too much comes
 from the central        power.       There is a deficiency of communal life
  and   independent        individual action.         The question with Germany
  is how to shift, without losing, the motive power.                      In England
  there is abundant local action and vitality, but               a  deficiency in cul
  tivated guidance for that action.            There is with us an immense lee
  way to    make up, both in overtaking, with primary instruction the
  masses    of the people, and also quite as much in regulating and
  defining     the aims and the method of secondary and university
  education.       The great question for England in this matter                  seems
  to be,   first, how to get over religious difficulties                in the way of
  primary     instruction     ;  and,   secondly, how to obtain a sufficiently
  enlightened      guidance for our higher education, without adopting,
  which all ought to deprecate,            anything like    a  bureaucratic system.

     In  the   present memoir         the author enters very fully into the
figure-of-8 wave movements, described by the wing in space, to which
 he first directed attention        in March    1867.*      He    has adduced    the
 experiments with natural and artificial wings, on which his descrip
 tion was originally based, and has shown, by the aid of original
 models and a large number of diagrams and drawings, that artificial
 wings can be made to approach indefinitely near to natural ones,
 not only in their         structure,    but also in their movements.             He
 further    points out that the fins and tail of the             fish — the flippers
 and caudal extremity of the whale, dugong, manatee, and porpoise,
 and the flippers      of the seal, sea bear, walrus, and turtle — bear a
 close analogy to wings, and ought to be studied               in connection with
 them.      As further proof that       the wing describes a figure-of-8 wave-
 track in flight, the author cites the results announced in February
 1869 by Professor        J.  E. Marey, of Paris. f

    Professor      Marey,     by employing     a sphygmograph           similar to
that used       for ascertaining     the state   of the pulse, succeeded in
causing the wings         of insects and birds to register their       own move
ments.       He says     :—
                             " But if the frequency of the movements of
"
   the  wing vary, the form does not vary.          It is invariably the same ;
"
   it is always a double loop, a figure of 8. Whether this figure be
"more or less apparent, whether its branches be more or less equal,
"
   matters little; it exists, and an attentive examination will not fail
"
   to reveal it." *
    The subjoined are a few of the results obtained by the author in
the course      of his numerous observations and experiments: —
    The wing is of a generally triangular form.               It is finely gradu
ated, and    tapers from the root towards the tip, and from the anterior
margin towards the posterior margin.            It is  likewise slightly twisted
upon    itself, and this remark holds true also of the primary or rowing
feathers    of the wing of the bird.         The wing      is convex above and
concave     below,   this shape,     and the fact that in     flight the wing is
carried obliquely forward like a kite, enabling it to penetrate the
air with its dorsal surface during the up stroke, and to seize it with
its ventral     one alike during the down and up strokes.           The same re
mark     applies to the remiges or rowing         feathers of the wing of the
bird.
    The wing is moveable in all its parts; it is also elastic.                  Its
power     of changing form enables it to be wielded intelligently,            even
to its    extremity    ;  its elasticity prevents shock, and contributes to
its   continued      play.     The wing of the insect is usually in one
piece,  t  that of the bat and bird always in several.            The curtain of
the   wing is      continuous in the bat, because of a delicate elastic
membrane which extends between the fingers of the hand and along
the arm ;     that of the bird is non-continuous, owing to the presence
of feathers,     which open and close like so many valves during the up
and down       strokes.
    The posterior margin of the wing of the insect, bat, and bird, is
rotated downwards and forwards              during    extension, and upwards

beneath the elytra or wing cases.

and backwards     during      flexion.      The     wing during       its vibration
descends   farther below the body than it rises above                  it.   This is
necessary for elevating purposes.
   The distal portion of the posterior margin of the wing of the
insect is twisted in a downward and forward direction at the end
of the down stroke, whereas, at the end of the up stroke it is
twisted downwards and backwards.                The proximal        portion of the
posterior margin always assumes a reverse position to that occupied
by the distal portion, so that the posterior and anterior margins                   of
the wing are not in the same plane, and in certain situations                     the
two margins     appear to cross each other.              What    is   here   said   of
the insect's wing      applies equally        to the wings of the bat and
bird.
   The wing during its vibrations          twists and untwists, so that       it acts
as a reversing    reciprocating       screw.     The wing is consequently a
screw structurally and functionally.
   The blur or impression produced               on   the eye by the rapidly
oscillating wing is twisted upon itself, and resembles the blade of an
ordinary screw propeller.
   The twisted configuration of the wing               and  its screwing action
are due to the presence of figure-of-8 looped         curves on its anterior and
posterior margins    ;   these   curves,    when    the wing is vibrating,         re
versing and reciprocating         in such a manner as to make the wing
change form in all its parts.        The curves in question are produced to
a great extent by vital movements,           independently alike of the elas
ticity of the wing    and the reaction       of the air.     They can, however,
be produced by the latter           agencies     likewise.     The change and
reversal of the curves occurring              on   the   anterior    and   posterior
margins cause the different portions of the wing to strike at various
angles during the down and up strokes.
   The angles which the different parts of the wing make with the
horizon are greatest towards the root, and least towards the tip of
the wing.     The angles     are,  in  fact, adjusted to the speed         at which
the different portions of the wing travel — a large angle with a low
speed   giving the  same amount         of buoying     and propelling power as
a small angle with     a  high speed.
   The speed attained by the tip of the wing is always very much
higher than that attained by those portions nearer the root — the

root corresponding to the short axis                        of rotation.         (The      long axis of
rotation runs along the anterior margin of the wing.)
  The angles which the wing makes with the horizon are increased
during the down stroke, and decreased                              during    the up stroke, the
posterior      margin of the wing being                        screwed      down upon the air
during the down stroke to increase the elevating                                   and propelling
power    of the wing, and unscrewed or withdrawn from the air during
the    up stroke to afford support, and assist in propulsion.
      The wing, in virtue of the variations of inclination of different
parts of its surface, acts as a true kite during both the down and up
strokes, i.e.,         it flies    down and up alternately in such a manner as to
keep its ventral              concave          or biting surface always closely applied
to the      air.       The wing          is,   therefore, effective during both the down
and up strokes, so            that      it   is a   mistake to regard the down stroke                   as
alone contributing                to   flight.      In    reality the down and up strokes
are parts      of      one    movement, the wing describing first                      a   looped and
then    a   wave track.
      The tip of the wing in especial acts as                           a   kite      during        the up
stroke, the         kite being inclined upwards, forwards, and outwards.
      The kite formed                  by the wing differs from the boy's kite                          in
being capable             of change of form in all its                  parts.        The change of
form of the         wing      is   rendered necessary by the fact, that the wing                        is
articulatedor hinged at its root (short axis), its different parts, as                                   a
consequence, travelling at various degrees of speed in proportion
 as    they are removed from the axis                        of rotation.        It   is   also practi
 cally hinged along its anterior                         margin (long axis), so that the tip
 travels at        a   higher speed than the root, and the posterior                             margin
 than     the anterior.                The compound rotation and varying                       degree   of
 speed    attained by the different parts of the wing has the effect
 of twisting the wing upon its long axis, and producing                                    a   variety of
 kite-like surfaces calculated to operate                             effectually upon the air,
 whatever the position                  of the wing may           be.
      The wing, when the flying animal                        is   fixed or hovering steadily
 before an         object, describes           a    figure-of-8    wave track in space,             — the
 figure-of-8,        when the animal flies in                 a    horizontal direction, being
 opened      out or unravelled to form first                      a   looped and then           a   waved
 track.
      In horizontal          flight the wing describes                a'series of large waves or

340                 Proceedings     of the Royal Society
curves,   the body describing     a series   of smaller and opposite curves,
the  wing always rising when the body falls, and vice versa. The
descent of the wing in this manner necessitates             the elevation     of the
body, and the descent of the body contributes to the elevation of
the wing.
   The wing      elevates   the body when       it   descends,    and the     body,
when    elevated,   falls forwards in a curve, and so contributes to the
elevation of the wing.         This arrangement draws         the wing     forward
upon the air during the up stroke, and opposes                 the direct down
ward action of gravity by presenting the concave or biting surface
obliquely    to  the   air in the direction      of the travel of the body.
The under surface of the wing          is  thus made to act as a true kite
during the up stroke.
   The wing is urged at different velocities, the power applied being
much greater during          the down stroke than         during    the up one.
The power is also greater         at the    beginning of the down          and up
strokes than towards the termination          of   those acts.     The variation
in the intensity of the driving power is necessary             to slow the    wing
towards the termination of the down stroke, to prepare it for the
up stroke, and to afford the air an opportunity of reacting on the
under surface of the wing, to the elevation of which it contributes.
The wing is     elevated   more slowly than it is depressed, and allows
the body time to fall downwards, the fall of the body assisting                   in
elevating the wing relatively to the bird.          The wing,    the air, and the
weight of the body, are consequently active and passive by turns.
   The wing is       depressed    by voluntary       muscular     efforts.    It   is
elevated by vital, and mechanical acts, viz., by the contraction of
the elevator muscles and elastic ligaments, by the reaction of the
air called into play by the fall and forward travel of the body.
   If  the wing is in one piece, it is made to vibrate figure-of-8
fashion in a more or less horizontal direction.            It  thus attacks the
air by a series     of zig-zag    movements, very similar to those per
formed by an overloaded dray-horse when ascending a hill.                    If the
wing is in more than one piece, it is made to oscillate in a more
or less vertical direction ; the wing, under these circumstances, being
usually closed during the up stroke and opened out during the down
stroke.    The wing is closed       and   its area diminished        during     the
up stroke, expressly to avoid the resistance of the air.

      Tbe wing of the insect                    is,     in   some cases (the wasp, for instance),
folded upon               itself during         the back stroke to avoid the resistance of
the    air  ;      in other       cases, when two pairs                    of wings            are present (the
butterfly,   for example), the first pair of wings                                    is    made to overlap
the    second pair for  similar purpose.

less   horizontal direction,               it   is    followed in its passage from right to left

 a
When the wing passes from left to right     followed by current            it   is                        a
which the wing meets                     in its         passage from            right     to left, and so on.
The wing has therefore the power of creating the current on which
it   rises.
     When the wing                is   in several pieces, and made to vibrate more or
less   vertically,            one portion           of the pinion (during the                   acts      of exten
sion and flexion) makes     current which another portion utilises.
                                               a
Thus the tip and root of the wing (hand and arm) make     current                                         a
during extension on which the middle part of the wing (fore-arm)
acts    during flexion, and the reverse.                                This arrangement                  begets     a
cross    pulsation, and extends in the bird even to the primary and
secondary            feathers.          The wing may thus be said to rise upon                                       a
whirlwind of its own forming.
     The wing has the power of producing                                    artificial currents, and of
utilising and avoiding natural currents, so that                                     it   is   equally adapted
for flying           in   a   calm and in           a   storm.       As the wing (or parts of                      the
wing) strikes in opposite directions,                              it   in this manner reciprocates,
the     down         stroke running into and contributing                                  indirectly to the
efficacy      of the          up stroke, and the reverse.                   The down and up strokes
consequently               form one            continuous           act,    and      neither         is   complete
without         the other.              The down stroke produces                               the    current       on
which the            wing operates during the up stroke, and vice versa.
     The reciprocation of the wing                            is   most perfect when the animal
is   fixed      in   one       spot, and least perfect when                      it   is   flying      at     a   high
horizontal           speed.        It    is,   however,        a   matter of indifference whether
the    wing attacks the air or the air attacks the wing, so long as                                                 a
sufficient quantity of air                     is   worked up under the wing in any given
time.
     The wing of the bat and bird are drawn towards the body and

momentum acquired           by the     pinion   during   its descent,    and to
prepare it for making the up stroke.            It is elevated as a short lever
to avoid the resistance      of  the air, and pushed away from the body or
extended towards the end of the up stroke to prepare it for making
the down stroke.         It  is depressed     with   great energy as a long
lever,    and hence the greater elevating           and  propelling    power of
the down as compared         with the up stroke.
    When the      bat and   bird are stationary, the tip of the wing, from
its alternately     darting out and in, and forwards and backwards,
during       extension   and    flexion,   and during     the down      and    up
strokes, describes an ellipse, the axis of which is inclined obliquely
upwards and forwards.           When the     bat and bird are progressing at
a   high speed, the axis of the ellipse is inclined           obliquely down
wards and forwards, the ellipse         itself being converted into      a spiral
 and then a wave line.          The outward      and forward (extension) and
inward and backward (flexion) play of the pinion contributes to the
balancing power of the bat and bird, as it augments the horizontal
area of support.
    The wing of the insect is recovered or drawn towards the body,
and that of the bat and bird recovered, flexed, and slightly elevated
by the action of elastic ligaments.           Those ligaments, by their con
traction, conserve and interrupt muscular efforts without destroying
 continuity of motion.
    The elastic ligaments       are in many cases furnished      with muscular
 fibres,   and are most highly differentiated         in those animals whose
 wings vibrate the quickest.
     The primary, secondary, and tertiary feathers of          the wing    of the
 bird    are  geared   to each other       by fibrous structures     in such a
 manner that the feathers are made to rotate in one direction during
 flexion,    and in another and opposite direction during             extension.
 The double rotation of the feathers in question confers a distinctly
 valvular action on the wing of the bird.
     The under surface of      the wing of the bat and bird is thrown into
 a   beautiful   arch during extension and the down stroke, the arch
 being so formed that its tension increases according to the pressure
 applied.
     The wing is inserted into the upper part of the thorax, and
  balances the body by playing alternately above, beneath, and on a

 level with it.      When    above the body, the latter is suspended         from
 the   wings as from a parachute.            When beneath the         body,   it is
 suspended     from the top of a cone formed by the wings, and when
 on a level    with the body, the latter is placed in the centre of               a
 circle   described     by  the rapidly oscillating        wings.      The   body
 is suspended      from the wings very much            as a compass      set upon
 gimbals is suspended.
    The wing balances the body in consequence              of its travelling     at
 such a speed      as enables   it to convert the     area mapped out by its
 vibrations into what is practically        a solid basis of support.
    The wing, whether        in  one piece     or in many, rotates upon two
 centres,   the one centre corresponding to the root        of the wing (short
 axis), the other to the anterior margin (long axis).                The rowing
 feathers have a similar compound motion. This mode of action of the
 wing is intimately associated with the power it enjoys of alter
 nately seizing and evading the air, of producing            artificial currents,
 and  of utilising artificial and natural currents.
    The wing is cranked slightly forwards,          a  small degree of rotation
of the   anterior margin being followed by          a very considerable sweep
of the   posterior margin.
   The wing area is greatly in excess of what is absolutely neces
sary,   and    as   much    as  four-sixths may       be removed       in certain
insects   (the common blow-fly,         e.g.), without destroying the power
of  flight.     The wing area may also be considerably reduced in
birds   without in any way impairing flight.                  This shows that
elaborate    calculations    of wing area, in relation to weight of trunk,
must     prove    futile,  unless   the   rapidity with which          the   wing
vibrates    and the state of the air are also taken into account.
   Weight is necessary to the flight of the insect, bat, and bird, as
at   present constructed.         If  flying creatures were lighter than
the air,  the wing would require to be twisted completely round as in
the auks     and penguins, so that the under ventral or concave surface
would   strike from below upwards,         instead of from above downwards.
   In aerial flight the under or concave              surface of the wing is
applied   from    above,  whereas in subaquatic flight it is applied frj>m
kloxo.     The scull, like the subaquatic wing, is applied from below,
so that the analogy between        the aerial wing and the oar      as  employed
in  sculling is more apparent than real.

  A diving bird which flies under the water is lighter than the
water, and flies downwardt.  A bird which flies in the air is
heavier than the       air, and flies upwards.                  Relative levity and weight
are therefore         necessary to the diving and flying bird as at pre
sent constituted.
    Weight, when          associated       with         or   operating         upon wings, con
                             A flying animal, when it drops from
tributes to horizontal flight.
a   height with expanded motionless wings, does not fall vertically
downwards, but           downwards             and forwards,             the wings converting
what would otherwise be a vertical                           fall of the body partly into
forward      travel.     The weight of the body thus to                          a   certain extent
relieves the muscular system from excessive exertion.                                      If   a suffi
cient breeze       be blowing, the weight                    of the trunk and the breeze
upon the wings               operating conjointly are sufficient                       to keep the
body   of the animal in the air for protracted periods.                                This is well
seen in the case of the albatross, which can sail about for an hour
at a time when there is wind without once flapping                                   its wings.
    The wing,      as a rule, is more flattened                     in the insect than in the
bat    and    bird.     It    is,   moreover, driven                at   a   higher speed,        those
animals which           fly the quickest                having       for the most part               the
flattest wings.         The dragon fly furnishes                    a    good example.
    The greater the concavity of the wing, the greater the elevating
power   ;    the flatter the wing, the greater the propelling power.
    The wings in living animals are thoroughly under control both
during       the down and up strokes               ;     the    wing, consequently,             is   not
simply       an elastic apparatus, which                 derives the movements of its
separate      parts from the             air   ;   on    the contrary,           it    directs       and
controls the air in such             a   manner as to extract the maximum of
support and propulsion from it.
    The wings of bats and birds are moved by direct muscular action
in combination with certain elastic                      ligaments, and the same holds
true of the dragon fly and some other insects.                                  The elasticity of
the wing and the resiliency and reaction of the air, however, assist
the muscles and ligaments.
    The great speed attained by the tip and body of the wing      due                           is
to the  fact that the wing    articulated or jointed at its root, any
                                         is
movement communicated                    at the     root       being quickened           in propor

tively slow movement             communicated to the root of the wing is at
once converted         into a very rapid one at the tip.
    If   an   artificial wing       be constructed      in strict accordance with
any     of the natural wings (insect, bat, or bird), and applied by a
sculling figure-of-8 movement to the air, it will be found to supply
a  steady     buoying and propelling power, similar in all                  respects   to
that supplied        by the living wing.
    In order to        secure     this   result, the artificial     wing    should     be
concavo-convex, and slightly twisted upon itself, i.e., it should be
finely arched in every direction.                It  should be mobile as well as
elastic.* and be applied to the air at different angles and at different
degrees     of   speed,    in such    a manner that the wing         and air may be
active and passive by turns.
    The artificial wing, like the natural one, must be more or less
triangular in shape.            It must taper from the root towards the tip,
and     from the anterior margin               in the direction      of the posterior
margin.         It  should     be    capable of change of form,            and    elastic
throughout,        the   flexibility being greatest        at the tip and posterior
margin of the wing, and least at the root and along the anterior
margin.         It   must     move     in all its parts     at different    periods of
time,      as    in this      way the      air    is  alternately    seized and dis
missed,       dead     points    avoided,     and    a   continuous      reciprocating
 movement secured.              In      producing     a   continuous     vibration      of
the     artificial wing, much assistance is obtained by employing                        a
 ball-and-socket        joint at its root, with a        system   of elastic springs
 of    different     strengths.        The principal       springs     should     be  ar
 ranged      at right angles to each other, the superior and posterior
 springs       being      stronger     than    the   inferior   and     anterior ones.
 Oblique springs may be added,                  and  the whole, because         of their
 different      strengths     and     their peculiar directions       and    insertions,
 can be made to give the wing any amount                     of torsion in the direc
 tion    of its length during every portion of either the up or down
 stroke.       The muscles and elastic ligaments of insects, bats, and
 birds,    perform      a   similar function.        A ball-and-socket         joint, or
 what     is equivalent thereto, is necessary             at the root of the wing,

 be composed      of a rigid rod in front and a flexible sail behind, but experiment
 has   convinced the author that no part of the wing should be absolutely rigid.

because the pinion should be free to move in an upward, downward,
forward, and backward direction.                          It    should also be able to rotate
around its anterior margin to the extent of nearly a quarter of a
turn. All the movements referred to are derived in the author's
models from a direct piston action, from the reaction of the air, the
elasticity of the wings and springs, and the weight of the machine
bearing the wings.      They are restrained and directed by the
gearing apparatus                 extending between the piston and the wings, but
more especially by the different lengths, strengths, and directions
of the elastic springs themselves.                            The piston is made to descend
with      a   very violent hammer-like                    motion at the beginning of the
down        stroke, the movement being gradually slowed                                 as   the wing
descends           to      a certain point,         at    which           the   movement          is   re
versed         and the piston               ascends       more       slowly,     its ascent        being
occasioned             for the most part by the reaction of the air, the elas
ticity of the wing and of the springs at its root, and by the descent
of the engine propelling                       the wings.                The driving power,            the
weight of the apparatus, the recoil of the air, and the elasticity of
the wings and springs are thus made to act in concert, the different
forces        being active and               passive      at intervals,         and    no two forces
acting together at precisely the same instant of time.

half-an-inch               in breadth, be taken by the extremity and made to
vibrate, it will be found that a wavy serpentine motion is produced
in    it,     the waves being greatest                   when the vibration             is   slow, and
least     when          it   is   rapid.     It    will further           be found       that, at the
extremity of the section                       where          the impulse        is    communicated,
there         is   a   steady     reciprocating          movement devoid of dead points.
The continuous movement in question                                 is   no doubt due to the fact
that the different portions of the reed reverse at different periods,
the undulations induced in the reed being to an interrupted or
vibratory movement very much what the continued play of                                            a   fly

margin  of the wing be directed upwards, and the angle which the
under surface of the wing makes with the horizon be something less

   If the  artificial wing   be  in one piece, it ought to be made to vibrato
in a more or less horizontal direction ; if in several pieces, it should
be worked in a more or less vertical direction, as the wing                   in this
case acts    alternately    as a   short and long lever, in virtue of its
closing and opening during the up and down strokes, the                       acting
area  of the wing being greatly          reduced     during the up stroke, and
greatly increased during the down one.
   If a properly constructed artificial wing be made to vibrate                  in  a
vertical direction, it invariably darts downwards               and forwards in a
curve during the down stroke, and upwards and forwards in a similar
but opposite curve during the up stroke, the two curves                     running
into each other to form a progressive, continuous,               wave  track.
   If  the wing be made to vibrate from side to side                    in a more
or less horizontal      direction,    it rises   zig-zag fashion by a series of
looped     curve    movements,       each     pass  of the wing being on            a
higher level than that which preceded                it. Whether the wing be
moved vertically      or horizontally,      it invariably twists and untwists
during its action.       In twisting and untwisting, it developes figure-
of-8 curves, not only along its anterior and posterior margins, but
throughout its entire length and breadth.
   The figure-of-8      vertical movement may be converted into the
figure-of-8    horizontal    movement by a slight rotation of the wing
on its long axis, or by a          tilt of the body or frame bearing the
wing.     It  is in this way that the wing may act either as an ele
vator and propeller, or         merely as an elevator.             Thus it is not
uncommon to see an insect elevate itself by                a  horizontal   screwing
figure-of-8    movement,     and then, suddenly changing             the direction
of the stroke of the wing and of the body, dart forward in a nearly
horizontal direction.
   The artificial wing, like the true one, attacks the air at a great
variety of angles during the down and up strokes. Thus during
the down stroke the angles which the wing makes with the horizon
are increased, whereas during the up stroke they are diminished.
   The angles made by the different portions of the artificial wing
vary as in the living wing, the angles made                  by the parts nearest
the root being greater than those              nearer   the   tip.   This   is occa
sioned by the manner            in which       the  artificial   wing    twists  and
untwists during its action, the torsion in question being due to the

elastic    properties of the wing and the resistance which it experi
ences    from the air, as well as to the fact that the tip and posterior
part    of the wing travel at a much higher speed than the root and
anterior part.        The small angle made by the tip, as compared with
the root of the wing, equalises its action, a large angle urged at a
low speed        giving   the same   amount of buoyancy and propelling
power as a smaller angle urged at a higher speed.
    The artificial      wing, because   of its elasticity and by the aid of
certain springs, can be made to slow and               reverse    of its  own accord
at    the   end    of the down    and   up strokes in precisely the same
manner as the natural wing.            It  can   likewise      be made to change
its course      without   halt or dead point, so as to give continuity              of
motion and continued buoyancy.
    If   the artificial   wing be moved figure-of-8 fashion in a more or
less    horizontal direction, it can be made to create                and  utilise its
own currents, the stroke from         right   to    left producing the currents
ou    which the wing rises in its passage from left to right, and the
reverse.       It can  also be made to utilise and evade natural currents.
     If  the   tip of a properly     constructed       artificial   aerial wing be
 turned downwards, and the wing be made to move from side to side
 figure-of-8     fashion like the tail of a fish, it forms         a  very excellent
 aerial propeller.
     The artificial wing, to be effective, must rotate about two separate
 axes, the    one corresponding to its root (short axis), the other to its
 anterior margin (long axis).
     If  two artificial wings, similar to those described, be placed end
 to end,    inclined    at a certain  upward angle, and made to revolve,
 they form a most powerful           aerial screw.        This form of screw         is
 propelled      with   comparatively     little    force,    and    its   working   is
 attended with quite a nominal amount               of slip.
     The aerial screw here recommended is elastic and capable of change
 of form in all its parts, and so constructed that its angles vary to
  adapt themselves to the speed attained by the different portions                  of
  the blades at     any given time.     Thus the angles         made by the blades
  are greatest    when the speed at which the screw is driven is least, and
  vice versa   ; the angles made by those portions of the blades which
  are nearest     the axis of rotation     being always greater than those
  made by     the portions nearer the tips of the blades.               This form of

aerial screw differs widely from the aerial screws at present           in use,
and from the screw propeller          employed in navigation, inasmuch
as  it is moveable    in all its parts, and adjusts itself to its work in
such a manner as to secure          the maximum of elevating and pro
pelling    power,   with a minimum of slip.        The   screw propeller and
aerial screws as at present employed           are, on the contrary,      rigid
and unyielding, and possess        no accommodating power.           As a con
sequence,    much propulsive power is sacrificed in slip.
   If the blades    of the aerial screw referred to be greatly     diminished
in size, and formed of carefully tapered,            finely graduated steel
plate, it operates with remarkable efficiency in water, the elasticity
of the    screw  diminishing the slip, while it greatly augments the
propelling power.

     Professor KELLAND, Vice-President, in the Chair.
   At    the   request of the Council, Dr          J.  Collingwood      Bruce
delivered an Address on " The Results of the More Recent
Excavations on the Line of the Roman Wall in the North
of England."
   Nearly    a century after    Julius   Caesar had landed in this island
the conquest of Britain was begun in earnest.
   In the year     79 Agricola planted the Eagles of Rome        on the banks
of the Tyne,      and during the next campaign carried his conquests
as far as the    Tay.    Before he gave up his command, he had raised
the Roman standard in the Orkney Islands.
   When Rome planted her foot           she usually planted     it firmly, and
thus she retained in her grasp all the best            portions of the island
for more than 300 years.         Some of the legions which landed in the

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                                    351
time of Claudius              remained in the island             until the   close       of the
Roman domination.
    In the year          410,      when Alaric        and     his Goths    entered Rorne,
Honorius renounced all claim upon the allegiance of Britain.
    As to the origin of the wall, when Agricola advanced agains'
tbe    Caledonians, he thought               it   necessary   to use precautions against
a   rising amongst the conquered tribes whom he left behind him.
He made good roads contemporaneously                          with his advance.          As   he
moved         along he drew the road with him.                      By this means his
retreat was always secure and his supplies comparatively certain.                             It
is believed that we owe to him the northern                      Watling Street         and the
Maiden Way, which run northwards parallel to each other at about
twenty-five miles apart.                For miles together both of these roads
remain to this hour as              the Romans left them. Another precaution
adopted by       Agricola          was the  planting of garrisons in well-selected
situations.         There          were   two parts of the island where these
garrisons could be best placed, namely, where the                     influx of the sea
brings the eastern and western coasts                   into near contiguity — between
the Firths of Clyde and Forth, and                     between    the Tyne and Solway.
Here walls were afterwards built.                       The southern wall         was not a
mere fence.         It    was a line         of military operation.         In   erecting it
the Romans did not give up the country to the north                          of   it,   but by
its means made           it   more thoroughly their own.             A    transverse road
along    it   was   a   necessary adjunct.           At the Northumberland           Isthmus
Watling        Street        and    the Maiden         Way went north and south                ;
another road, which has been called the Stanegate, went from east
to    west.
     Dr Bruce then enumerated       of the principal stations in the
                                              some
wall as amplified and finally completed by Hadrian, who made
use of such of the pre-existing stations of Agricola as served his
purpose.
      The stationary          camps on the Roman wall                usually      have     four
gateways, one           in   each     end, and one       in each side rampart.            Each
gateway consists of two portals divided by strong piers of masonry,
with its own arch overhead.    There    uniformly guard chamber
                                                        is             a
on each       side of the gateway.
      The wall, as erected            by Hadrian, exists to this day in wonderful
completeness.            Except in places where towns                have    sprung up on

352                  Proceedings of       the   Royal Society
its site, there is scarcely a yard of its course from Wallsend                    to
Bowness where traces of it are not to be found.                Where the    stone
works have disappeared the fosse or               earthen ramparts generally
show themselves.
    The    wall   is   really   an   important     fortification,    consisting   of
 several   parts.     There    is first the stone      wall, with     a deep    and
 broad fosse on its northern margin           ; next, the vallum or earth      wall,
 which at varying        distances keeps to the south of the stone             wall.
 Then between        these was a well-made         road.     Lastly, there was a
 series  of stationary     camps, castles, and turrets, for the accommoda
 tion of the soldiery who garrisoned the structure.
    The length of the great wall             is said  to be seventy-three       and
 a-half miles.       It  is  usually about eight feet thick, and in two
 places  it now stands nine       and a-half feet high.        Its original eleva
 tion was much greater.
    The stations      were    military cities, mostly attached to the wall.
 The largest of them contain an area of six acres, some of them
 only three.       The stations are distant from one another at an
 average   of about    four miles.      Their form is that of a parallelogram
 with the corners rounded.            The first thing which the builders of
 the wall did was to build the station, when                 they felt that they
 could safely undertake the other parts of the fortification, running
 the   wall right and left.         The masonry of the gateways is pecu
 liarly  massive     and strong.       In   some   of them the joints are as
 close as ever, and the courses         as true as they were 1700        years ago.
 As far as can be ascertained, every station had a double gateway
 opening northwards, as well as in other directions.                    The north
 gate of Borcovicus         station (House-steads) must have been much
 used, for its threshold is deeply worn by the feet of passengers.
    That the Romans did not give up to the enemy the country on
 the north side of the wall is shown by a circumstance that the
 garrison at the station of Borcovicus had an amphitheatre provided
 for their amusement on the north side                 of   the wall, where     the
 ground outside the wall was best suited for its formation.                  It was
 not unusual with          the Romans        to  provide    amusements for the
 soldiery even upon a campaign.
    In crossing from         sea to sea, the wall, about         the centre of its
 course,   comes     near   an upheaved       mass of basalt.       For about   ten

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                       353
miles    it  takes advantage of this circumstance, and swerving out of
its direct       course, seizes    hill after hill,  so as to present to the
enemy not          only the obstacle of its own height, but that of the
ridge    of which it is built. A similar and more striking one of the
natural ground is seen at Peel Crag.
    When the wall runs over precipitous ledges like this, the fosse
on the      north side of it is of course discontinued, but the moment
it again descends into the valley          it is renewed.
     Dr Brace's paper contained several other particulars illustrating
 the present condition         of the wall, and showing the powerful        and
 systematic        organisation displayed in its construction       as a means
 of commanding           and keeping in subjection the adjacent country.
 It   also contained       references to the monuments and inscriptions
 found in the       line of the wall, indicating in particular the prevalent
 religious feelings of the period, and in particular showing an
 infusion of Eastern ideas into the native mythology of the Romans.

      Objects from the Nicobar Islands of great Ethnological
      interest. By T. C. Archer, Esq. Specimens were exhi
      bited.
      Mr Archer exhibited          two interesting    Foraminifers,   one  being
  Saccammina Carteri, which forms a large proportion            of the Carbonif
  erous    limestone at    Elf hills, Northumberland     ; the other, a gigantic
   species    of  the Arenaceous group brought from Persia by the late        Mr
   Loftus, and named after him, Loftusia persica.           The latter specimen
   was that to      which  Mr Archer especially called the attention of       the

354                 Proceedings     of the Royal Society
Society, as it was similar to a class of fossils which had previously
been   found in the Upper Greensand formation              in England,    and
believed     to  be  sponges.     However,   the whole      history  of these
monsters of their        Order has been      so well    worked    out in  the
admirable monograph of Dr Carpenter and Mr H. B. Brady, that
their proper character is now thoroughly known.
   Mr Archer also exhibited          some   objects of great Ethnological
interest from the Nicobar Islands.
   The following is      the  Memorandum       accompanying the Wooden
Figures obtained by Captain Edge,           R.N.,  commander of H. M. S.
" Satellite," from the Nicobars, in July 1867.
   Reports having reached the authorities at Singapore that several
vessels had, from time to time, been attacked by the savages             upon
these   islands, and their crews barbarously murdered, it was deter
mined to despatch an expedition to that spot          ;  and accordingly,   in
July   1867,    H. M. ship " Wasp," Captain Bedingfield, R.N., and
H. M. ship " Satellite,"        Captain   Edge,   R.N.,   proceeded   thence.
The   savages fled on the approach       of the   vessels  of war, and upon
landing     at Enounga,     one  of the largest of the villages, Captain
Edge discovered these figures in their huts, and upon his return to
Singapore he gave them to Major M'Nair of the Royal Artillery
for presentation to     a  museum.
   The photographs are those of three of the savages                who were
captured, and of a little girl of seven years of age, who was rescued
from their hands and brought to Singapore.

not the       works of the natives, but have been produced by some

2.    Certain Phenomena applied in Solution of Difficulties con
     nected    with the Theory of Vision.                       By E. S. Wyld, Esq.
     The theory of vision has been the subject of much more scientific
study than that   of any of our other senses, but notwithstanding
this, the subject is still encumbered with some difficulties and con
tradictions, the solution of which is essential to our having a true
and complete        theory.      Such are the questions, — first, — regarding
single and double vision, as depending                         on the excitement       of    cor
responding,        or, as they are             generally      called, identical     points of
the retinae ;       second,   — the question whether perception is in the
retinae      or in the brain        ;    and    lastly,      the question regarding          the
decussation and ultimate course                  of the fibres of      the optic nerves.
     Regarding the subject of single vision with two eyes, there has fre
quently been exhibited          a       great amount of misunderstanding               ;    since
the    discovery of the stereoscope,              however, the nature of what has
commonly,        though not with               strict     propriety,   been    called single
vision, has become            much better understood.                  The truth      is,   there
is   no such      thing as single vision when two eyes are in use, and
a     very   little attention will make     clear how the case stands.
                                                        it
Take two        shillings of like          appearance,         and   place   them correctly
and    with the same sides up, in the different compartments of the
stereoscope, but so far apart that they do not appear to coalesce.
In this position           they are        distinctly        seen    by each    eye    as    two
separate      objects.     Cause the coins next gradually                    to approach      till
they seem       to coalesce     or unite into one — we               say seem, for there       is
no true       visual union.             Even when they          seem to unite, there are
 still two impressions made              —one     on each retina — and         a   correspond
ing impulse        is   from each of these membranes sent to the brain and
 to   the mind, though         from the close resemblance of the two im
pressions     it   may be impossible to distinguish                     the one from the
other.

356                    Proceedings              of the Royal Society
  To     prove      that     there are two mental impressions,                         let    us     re
verse    one of the coins.            When this is done, we have no longer
the impression         of    one   coin, but of two coins occupying the same
place.       Both are visible, and they appear as                     if   the one were       visible
through       the other.           While        we     steadily regard this             anomalous
presentation, the eye and the judgment                             become alike        puzzled by
it,   and an effort    is   made to reduce the phenomenon to                       a   normal and
intelligible object of vision      succession of transformations
                                            ;   a                   the                        is
result of the joint action  of the  mind,  and of the disturbed nervous
centres which ensues; at one moment we see one coin, and then,
suddenly,     it    disappears,     and the other takes its place                 ;   then we see
both coins at once, or          a   part of each perhaps becomes alone visible.
In ordinary vision, then,               we must conclude that objects make                           an
equal impression on the identical points of each retina, though we are
not intellectually          conscious of the fact of duality                ;   and the question
thus arises,     If there     are two retinal impressions, how do we account
for the two appearing as             if      superimposed the one on the top of the
other?       The eyes are set apart in the head, and                               the supposed
sensory ganglia at the base of the brain, the corpora geniculata, the
corpora quadrigemina, and the optic thalami, are all in duplicate                                     :
and the cerebral hemispheres divide the head in two equal sections.
How, then, are we to account for the two visual                                    images being
united   ?    It    has been very generally assumed                        that the mind com
bines the two impressions, as                       it   were,     into    one.       This    is    the
opinion of Professor Wheatstone and Dr Carpenter, and                                   it    was for
many years my opinion               ;       but the phenomena about to be alluded
to convinced me that          I     was wrong, and that there exists                   a     physical
cause for the union of the two images                         ;    and to prove this           is   the
main purpose of the paper.
  When        we take two strips of white                         card-board about an inch
broad, and insert one at each side of the stereoscope,                                we find that
each strip     is   distinctly     seen by each eye           ;    but when we cause them
gradually to approach              till the two            ends    appear       to overlap say an
inch or more, the effect                    singular.       Where the strips seem over
                                    is is
lapping, the brightness                     observed     instantly to become very much
increased    :   so much so, indeed,                that when we fix the attention on
the quadrangular part formed by the overlapping ends,                                  all the     rest
of the strips become               invisible,        and    the     overlapping        parts alone

 remain    distinct objects of vision. It may however be mentioned,
 by the    way, that either of the cards may be recalled to sight by
the    simple act of moving            it two or three times backwards              and
forwards, and thus           exciting the nerve     and   arousing the attention        ;
but   this in no degree impairs the            superior brightness of       the over
lapping parts.
   Such are the facts, but what is the cause              of the increased bright
ness where the cards appear to overlap, and what is the cause of
the apparent overlapping where corresponding points of the retinae
are excited by objects in reality apart?                 I  am not aware of any
writer     having distinctly laid         before   us  a   specific physical     cause
accounting for these several             phenomena.        It appears    to me that
they clearly point to an anatomical cause.
   A great many writers              have   attributed    single vision     to  habit.
Dr Smith         in his optics attributes single vision to this cause.               Dr
Carpenter       also seems to take this view.         He says ("Physiology," p.
705),
          " A condition         of single vision seems to be that the two
images     of the object should fall on parts of the retinae accustomed
to act    in concert, and habit appears to be the chief means by which
this conformity is produced."               Dr Reid, in his "Inquiry into           the
Human       Mind,"      states that he has devoted       thirty years   to the study
of the subject, and            he accepts   it  as a mystery which        cannot be
explained.         Sir Wm. Hamilton attempts no explanation.                  Neither
does Sir D. Brewster in his famous controversy with Professor
 Wheatstone attempt any explanation.                  Buflbn thinks we first see
 objects double and inverted, and that we correct this judgment                      by
 experience.        Blanville, Gassendus, Porta, Tacquet,          and   Gall, main
 tain that we see with          only  one eye at a time.
    Perhaps       the majority      of writers     have   looked no deeper        than
 the    surface     of the retina,     and have been        content    to  state    the
 phenomena         as   depending      on   an   inscrutable     property    of that
 sensitive membrane, or simply as a law of our being                :  even as they,
 with quite as       little ingenuity, and with        less excuse,    attribute our
 sense   of visual direction to an inscrutable             property of the retina.
 Some    anatomists have, however, supposed that the decussation of the
 optic nerves      might explain the phenomena.              Dr Wollaston, from       a
 peculiar occasional disorder in his vision, suggested               that there was
 a crossing     of the    fibres from the inner parts of either retina to the
    VOL.   VII.                                                           3 u

ganglion on the opposite side of the head, while the fibres on the
outer side of each eye went to the ganglion on their own side of
the head.      This explanation evidently implies that        the retinae are
optically divided     in two halves, and that the images of objects
falling  on the centres    of the  retinae are   similarly divided, one half
of every object being represented on           the right side of the head,
and the other half on the left       ; and that objects whose images          fall
on the one side of the retinae are represented          only on the lobe       on
that side of the head.      This is surely extremely improbable.
    Newton,    in his optics, throws out a query (query 15th at the
end of Second Book), suggesting that the species or picture of the
objects seen with both eyes may          be  united in the commissure           of
the optic nerves,    the fibres of the right side of both nerves         uniting
there, and, after union, going thence into the brain on               the right
side of the head, and the fibres on the left side of both nerves, after
union in the commissure, going into the brain on the left side of
the head, and the two meeting in the brain in such a way that the
fibres make but one entire species or picture.           The writer had not
seen    Newton's    query   till after his paper      was  submitted to the
Council,    but he considers that Newton's           is the most advanced
position which      has up to the present times been             taken on the
subject.     It  is evident,    however,   that   Newton    had never very
carefully   reduced his idea to form, nor had he then the means
 which   we    now possess      of testing its correctness     ;    and it was
 doubtless owing to this circumstance that the idea, instead of being
 followed up and corrected in its details, was allowed to fall out of
 sight, and failed to gain the attention of optical writers.
    Whether there is or is not a crossing of the true visual or optic
 nerves in man and the higher mammalia seems yet to be an
 unsettled point, though the opinion         is gaining    ground that there
 is a crossing of the inner fibres.       It is always asked      if there  is no
crossing of fibres, why are the optic nerves brought into connection            ?
 The question, as an argument          in favour of the crossing,       is, how
 ever, robbed    of half its  force, when we consider that the apparent
 union of the commissure may not be for              a  transfer of the true
 nerves  of vision, but for effecting a union of the nerves essential
 for the nutrition of the retinae, and of those nerves whose func
 tion it is to secure equality and unity of action in the reflex opera

tions which            regulate the expansion and contraction of the iris of
the eyes.
   I   do not believe in any partial crossing of the true visual nerve-
fibres.          The fact, however,         of   an entire crossing, or             of   no crossing
at all, in no ways affects my theory, which                           I   shall now, after a few
necessary          words of explanation              regarding            the functions      of the
retina, proceed to explain.
  The central point of the retina, the fovea centralis, is distin
guished from the rest of the retina by its peculiar anatomical struc
ture.      It    is also distinguished           by its superior discriminating              powers.
It is     the only part of the retina which takes minute cognisance of
the forms             of objects.    We may satisfy ourselves of this by fixing
the eyes on any word in a printed book held                                at the usual reading
distance.           While the eyes remain fixed on the middle of any
word of,          say six or seven letters, most persons will find that they
are quite         unable to perceive a single letter of the adjoining word.
This proves              how   limited      is the area          of distinct        vision   on   the
retinae.
   When we fix the eyes on any distinct                                   object in an extended
landscape we turn the axis            of each                   eye   to the object especially
examined,             and the images of it fall                 on the fovea;        centrales,   and
appear single.             All   the other objects in the landscape are mapped at
the same time around these central points, on corresponding parts                                  of
each      retina, i.e., on parts which are correspondent in distance and
 direction, from the fovea; centrales;               and these objects also, so far as wo
 pan see         them, appear            The remarkable circumstance, how
                                    single.
 ever,     is,   that the slightest shift or displacement of the axis of one
 of the eyes, and              of the image on            it,   disorders correct vision, and
 produces the perception             of     a duplicate impression             of   the landscape.
 This circumstance has                led     authors very generally                  to the con
 clusion,        as
                  I     have said, that either habit, or some                    inscrutable law
 of the retinae, causes single vision when corresponding parts of that
 organ      are impressed, and double                 vision when non-corresponding
 parts    of the two retinae are acted on.                       The writer maintains that
 these phenomena,              and also the phenomenon of increased brightness
 obtained by the use                of both       eyes,    can only         be explained on the
 assumption            or theory, that the retinal   impulses of both eyes are
 united     in    a    central   cerebral sensorium.   He, therefore, suggests

 360                 Proceedings      of the Royal        Society
that the true optic or visual nerve-fibres from the retinae cross at
the optic commissure, that they are continued through the                           optic
 tracts, and sweep inwards to the corpus quadriyeminum;                       that those
from the       left eye enter that cerebral lobe at the right side,                    and
spread across and forward in          it in   the     form of an inverted cone               ;
while     the nerve-fibres of the right eye enter the same lobe                          at
the left side, and spread          in a like manner across it from left to
right.     The fibres     from each eye thus cross each other in                       this
lobe, which, from being an important central ganglion, and most                     inti
 mately connected with the fibres from the optic nerves, the writer
suggests as the probable sensorium in vision.                    The effect of         this
simple arrangement        is,   that the corresponding       nerve-fibres     from each
retina are brought into juxtaposition,              fibre to fibre   ;   and in   natural
vision the sensorium thus becomes the organ in which the nervous
impulses which come from the two eyes are united and grouped in
the form they occupy on the retinae.
   When,     then, in the experiment              before-mentioned we advance
the two strips of card-board          but     a   short way at each side          of the
stereoscope,     their images are found on the inner parts of each
retina, and the ends of the strips are seen as two separate objects,
because their       images are thrown on non-identical                   portions of the
retin», and different parts of the sensorium are accordingly im
pressed.  When, again, the strips are advanced     little further,   a
till   the images    begin to cross the centre of the retina of each eye,
the spectator immediately sees the ends to overlap, and at the same
time to acquire additional         brightness.        This evidently arises         from
the corresponding parts of each retina being impressed,                     and the two
similar    impulses being transmitted to that portion of the sensorium
with which these parts of the               retinap    are in connection,         —each
nerve-fibre from the one eye bringing its impulse into juxtaposition
with the corresponding impulse from the other eye. And thus we
account at once, for the increased                brightness,   and       the apparent
superposition of the images of external objects.                 A        diagram at     a
glance shows how these           are the necessary        results of the arrange
ment of the nerve-fibres which          we have suggested.
   That   the nerve -fibres coming from each               eye are        not united    or
fused in the sensorium, but merely brought into juxtaposition,                      is   a
 fact also proved by the following experiment with coloured strips.

When we introduce               a blue strip at the one side of the stereo
scope, and a red or yellow one at the other side,            till they  appear to
overlap or unite into one object, the result is increased brightness
where       they overlap;      but there is no blending of the colours so as
to produce         purple or green.       The   one coloured strip,     as in  the
experiment with the coins, shines through the other; or at one time
the colours are alternately visible, at another time one-half              of each
coloured end only is visible, and occasionally            spots  of the   one are
seen to shine through the ground colour             of  the  other, thus estab
lishing the important fact or law, that though the combination of
different colours, external to the living organism, produces the
effect of an intermediate colour, yet the impulse of different colours
 on separate       retinas can not be so combined by the           mind, but the
 impulse peculiar         to each   colour is conveyed by the nerve receiving
 it to the sensorium unchanged,             and excites in the mind its own
 characteristic sensation.           The increased  intensity where the adjoin
  ing nerve-fibres in the sensorium are all in action          I  attribute to the
  well-known        law of irradiation,      or lateral expansion      of nervous
  action, which exists among neighbouring             nerve-fibres when power

   3.   Additional Note on the Motion of a Heavy Body along
            the Circumference of a Circle.            By E. Sang, Esq.
                                        Abstract.
       In   the course   of physical inquiries we meet with many problems
    having the appearance          of great simplicity, and yet presenting to
    the    analyst   difficulties of the highest order.         The law of the
    motion    of a  heavy body along the circumference of a circle is one
     of these.

362                     Proceedings of the Royal Society
   One particular case of this motion, viz., the case of the swing
ing of    a  clock-pendulum,        is of paramount importance, and has been
investigated        with very great care.          In this    case our attention         is
directed principally           to the computation       of the time of        an  entire
oscillation, since it is this which determines the heating of the
clock.      In the paper to which this note is an addition (Vol. xxiv.
Trans.), a very rapid method of computing this total time is
given.       My object is now          to supply the deficiency         in that paper,
and to show how            the time of describing any given portion of the
whole arc may be computed.
   The general question             may     be stated   thus:   — A heavy body is
projected with         a  known velocity along the circumference of a circle,
and    we are required to compute the time in which                       it will reach
any indicated position, as also its place at any prescribed time.
   No practicable solution of either of these problems has hitherto
been given, with the exception of the case already mentioned.
This note contains a simple and complete solution of both
problems.
   If   a   heavy body be projected from the lowest point of a circle
along the circumference with              a  velocity less than that due to a fall
from the highest point, its motion becomes                    slower as it ascends,
and    its speed is entirely          exhausted at some point            in the semi-
circumference        ;   from that point it returns to the bottom                of  the
curve, passes         to the other       side,  and so oscillates.          But, if  the
initial velocity         be greater    than what is due to a fall along the
diameter, the body passes the zenith point, and circulates round
and round the circumference with an unequable motion.                        And  if the
velocity be      just sufficient to carry the body to the zenith point, it
rests there, and the motion ceases.                Now, while the investigation
of the oscillatory and of the continuous motion is difficult, that of
the  limit    between       the two is easy.
   If   the body move away from N with                   a   velocity due to      a  fall
through the distance ZN, it will have,                 when     it  reaches the point
A,  a velocity due to a fall through ZG,               Hut the distance through
which a weight falls freely is proportional                   to   the square of its
acquired velocity, and ZG is proportional                  to the square       of ZA     ;
wherefore       the velocity at the        point  A must     be proportional     to the
chord ZA      :   that is to say, the rate of increase of the angle            NZA     is

proportional          to its own cosine;                   or,   writing A for this angle,                      we
have
                           d A ce cos     A .dt      ,     dt oc sec     A . dA
and,      therefore,         the      time occupied               in passing over               some       fixed

ratio of    ET        to   EZ.       Hence, when

is   completely resolved.

obtain     the positions of the moving body after equal                                         intervals of
time.      The time of its reaching                       Z
                                                          is      thus infinite.
     The   relation of the continuous                          to the reciprocating            motion may
 be    exhibited           by    a   simple         contrivance.          Let two straight                     rods
                                                                                               A,
 AC, CB be jointed at the point                          C,    and let the two ends            B         be con
 nected     by   a    straight line, say an elastic thread.
     If   the rods be turned so as to lessen                         the angle ACB, the angles

3t>4               Proceedings       of the Royal Society
at  A and B will increase. If                the     motion    be sufficiently     con
tinued, the greater angle A will            become       a  right angle, and then
B will   have   reached     its maximum.             Should the motion be          still
further continued,      A  becomes      obtuse      and   B decreases; till, when
the rods    have    entirely    closed,   A becomes 180° and B becomes
zero.    Continuing    the angular motion,            A  becomes a reverse      angle,
and   B  appears    on the opposite side            of AB.      Thus   the  alternate
increase  and decrease of the smaller angle              B  resembles    the changes
of the angle     NZA (fig.      1), when the        motion is oscillatory.         And
at the same      time the      continual development of the angle at B

resembles    the change       of NZA when the heavy body over-passes
the zenith point.       The resemblance is           a close one,  for if we  suppose
CAB    to increase with a velocity proportional                to the   distance   PB,
intercepted     by the     perpendicular          CP, its variations        are   then
exactly analogous to those of the angle                NZA, when       a heavy body
revolving in a circle whose diameter is proportional                  to  AC, has its
velocity   at  the lower point          equal to that obtained             by falling
through a distance proportional            to    CB.     And similarly the varia
tions of the smaller angle B are analogous to the oscillations of                    a
heavy body in another circle, the greatest                    height being to the
whole diameter in the ratio of AC to CB.
   When AC is very small in comparison with CB, the maximum
angle B is also small ; that is to say, the arrangement represents an
oscillation   in a small arc       ; but when the two rods are nearly of
equal lengths, as in the case of CE,                 ED (fig. 3), the maximum
value   of D approaches          to a   right angle, and          the   arrangement
represents    an   oscillation     extending       to nearly the      whole   circum-

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                                 3G5
ference. If the trigon were               isosceles,    the representation would be
that of the motion which we               have already investigated.
     If the angle A vary with            a   velocity proportional        to   PB,   and   B
with a velocity proportional              to   AP,    the   exterior angle at C must
have the rate of its variation proportional to AB. Now, if we
make DCE (fig. 3), equal to half the sum of CAB and ABC, CE
a mean          proportional    between      AC     and   CB,    and  then inflect      ED
equal        to half the sum of the same lines, the perpendicular                        EQ
 intercepts        QD  just  half  of   AB.       Thus    QD    is proportional      to  the
 rate of increase of ECD, and consequently CQ to the rate of change
 of CDE            Thus the synchronous variations of the trigons ACB
 and     CED would represent four               connected     cases, two   of oscillation
 and two of revolution in          a  circle.
     Now, the ratio of CE to ED               is much nearer to one of equality
  than is the ratio of AC to CB;              and    if we were to proceed        again in
  the same way, we should obtain               a trigon still more nearly isosceles         ;
  and, after a very few operations of this kind, we shall obtain                   a trigon
  sensibly isosceles.         That    is   to say,      we shall     have    referred    the
  oscillation      in a given arc to the motion           in  just the whole circum         -
  ference.        So, seeing that     the     motion in this last case has been
  completely investigated, we have a complete solution                    of  the general
   problem     ;  the necessary calculations being of remarkable simplicity.
   4. On       the    Capture of a Sperm Whale on                         the Coast       of
      Argyleshire, with          a Notice of other Specimens caught on
       the    Coast of Scotland.           By Professor Turner.
      In   the autumn      of last  year,    whilst spending         a few days in the
   neighbourhood        of Oban,   I   visited Dunstaffnage,          and in the court
    yard of the Castle saw the two halves               of the lower jaw-bone of           a
    sperm-whale.        On inquiry,    I  learned that they were the relics of a
    whale captured       some   years ago in the neighbouring                 sea.    From
    some     of the older inhabitants        of Oban      I  gleaned some particulars
    respecting this animal;         and     as   no record      of its capture       has as
    yet found a place in zoological              literature,    I  am induced, as the
    sperm-whale so very seldom visits our shores, to communicate a brief
    notice to    the Society.
       In the month of May 1829                a  large whale was seen spouting in
       vor,.  til                                                               3d

the Sound between              Lismore, Mull, and the mainland.                                 The fisher
men were at first afraid to approach                                it,   but as, after         a   few days,
the animal became less active in its movements, they sallied forth
in boats,      and inflicted              severe      wounds with             harpoons and other
weapons.         The animal                  was    then secured,            and towed ashore in
Dunstaffnage Bay, close to the ruins of the Castle.                                        It   was said to
have been about 60 feet long, and possessed                                a   very bulky head, with
a   square snout.         It   was at once seen to be very different in                              its form
and appearance         from the large whales which usually visit our shores;
but    it   was not   until     an      oily fluid, which            flowed out of         a    wound near
the snout, and congealed on the surface of the water, was recognised
to be spermaceti, that the character and value                                   of the animal               was
determined.           A   considerable quantity of spermaceti was obtained
from the great cavity in the head, and the blubber yielded                                           a   large
amount of oil.        I    could learn nothing definite as to the sex.
    The lower jaw          was preserved                 as   a   relic in Dunstaffnage Castle,
and, in the garden             of   one      of   the hotels in Oban,            I    met with      a   caudal
vertebra, which was said to have belonged to this animal.
    When     I   saw the            jaw      it    was        much injured.             Not only         were
all the teeth lost, but the symphysial                                ends of both halves were
broken off, and the expanded articular                                portion     of the right half
sawn off and removed.                   It   is   to be feared,       if   some care be not taken
to preserve      the fragments which remain, that in                                   a   few years all
trace   of this rare      and interesting specimen                        will   have disappeared.
    From the left mandible some measurements were obtained which
may give an approximation                         to the dimensions              of    the bone.          The
length was 149 inches; but as the anterior end was                                             absent — as,
indeed, only the sockets of sixteen teeth remained — this measure
ment falls several inches short of the original length of the bone.
The articular         end was expanded, and possessed                            a    vertical diameter
of 22 inches.          On its inner face was the very large opening of the
dental canal.         Close to the junction of the articular and dentary
parts of the mandible                was      a    well-marked             constriction, where the
bone    measured       only         8    inches in breadth.                    The breadth of                the
alveolar edge of the jaw, about its middle, was                                         inches.         In   its
general form the            mandible               was    broad       and thin at its articular
part, then constricted, beyond which                           it   dilated, and then gradually
tapered away to the anterior extremity.

a description            of     it,    and says         he   has materials                  for    a    2nd part of
his    '
           Phalainologia.'                  Our whale was               a    male     :    the     penis appeared
near       7   feet     without         ye body.             The whole length of the creature
was near 52 feet,                   and         ye circumference of ye biggest part of                              it

teeth in it.             The       upper jaw had              sockets lined with cartilages to
receive 'em."
   Dr Wright has also inserted into the same copy of the " Phalain
ologia Nova"   plate containing six figures, which are marked as

bility prepared for the second part of his " Phalainologia," which
does   not seem, however, to have been published.
    In the year       1756 a sperm whale, 63 feet         long, is said to have
been    stranded on the west coast of Ross-shire.*
    In the year      1769    a  third specimen      was seen in the      Forth.    It
ran    ashore    on Cramond         Island,   on   December 22, and was there
killed.     It  was described and figured by           Mr James Robertson, of
Edinburgh,        in the "Philosophical          Transactions."!        This animal
was a     male, and measured         54 feet in length, the greatest circum
ference    being    30 feet.
    In the Statistical Account of Scotland, vol. v., 1793, it is stated
in   the account of Unst, in Shetland, that " the spermaceti whale
sometimes       wanders to this coast, and is here entangled and taken."
 The Rev. George Low, in his             " Fauna Orcadensis,"
                                                                    1813, says that
 the   sperm whale
                         " is often drove ashore       about the Orkneys, and
 sometimes      caught.      One, about 50 feet      long, was caught in Hoy
 Sound, some years ago, from which was extracted a vast quantity
 of spermaceti ; as also another, which drove ashore in Hoy."
     The most recent specimen, also a male,                 of this animal        was
  washed    ashore, in     a   much decomposed       state,   in  July   1863,  near
 Thurso.       The skeleton was presented to the British Museum,                 and
 formed a      part of the material from which Professor Flower                   has
  drawn up      his admirable account of the osteology of the sperm
  whale.
     This whale, in the tropical           or semi-tropical      seas, which   more
  especially   are its proper habitat, moves about, as a general rule, in
  large   herds or " schools."          The eight well-authenticated speci
  mens    which have now been captured on the Scottish coasts have
  been   solitary animals, which have wandered northwards, perhaps,
  in the  track of the Gulf Stream. Of these eight specimens the sex

5.   On    the     Efficient     Powers       of Parturition.            By Dr       J.
                              Matthews Duncan.
    There can be no doubt that, among the numerous matters at
present occupying         the   attention    of obstetricians,       none    is  more
important than the subject of this             paper.      So evident     is the cor
rectness    of     this  statement    that     one   cannot       but wonder       why
attempts to arrive at the truth              have   been,    so far as we       know,
delayed    till  the present day.      It  is long since excellent        researches
of   an analogous       kind in regard      to the force of the circulation          of
the blood,      the   power of the ventricles of the heart,               were    pub
lished   ; yet such researches do not seem naturally so attractive, nor
do they give promise         of  so valuable     practical results as those into
the power     of labour.
    It is well known that the first and,          I  believe, the best results in
this inquiry have been obtained by careful deduction from experi
ments on the tensile strength of the amniotic                     membrane.        The
researches      referred to were made quite independently,                 and    pub
lished soon after one another by Poppel, of Munich, and by                         Tait
and myself conjointly.           Studying this subject,         I thought     of some
other modes of reaching conclusions, such as by observations on the
caput succedaneum.            Means     might     be taken       to find    the   force
 required to raise a caput succedaneum, and the variations of force
 required to raise this swelling          in different degrees         of thickness.
 Such an investigation          would, no doubt, lead to similar             valuable
 results, but the plan has never been employed.                     Again, observa
 tions might be made to ascertain the force required to rupture the
 fourchette or the perineum, and thus               a  fact might      be got which
 would     be    of service     in  this    inquiry.       It   is well   known       to
 accoucheurs how these parts sometimes offer               a  successful resistance
 to all the powers of labour.         This resistance,       if  its force be ascer

                                of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                                      371
tamed, is           of    course a measure          of the power employed               ;    at least, it
would afford a valuable result as to the                            limits of the power.           Like
statements            might       be made regarding            the laceration of the margin
of the cervix uteri, as a test     of the power exerted at the completion
of the      first stage of labour.    Many methods were available, but
none were            till   very recently worked out.
      It is probable that many intelligent and thoughtful                                   accoucheurs
had some            rough ideas as to the amount of power exerted in partu
rition.       They could not fail, in attending on ordinary labours, to
observe      the strength of hand and arm required to keep back the
head too        rapidly advancing over                 a   delicate perineum.               This power
is,   under certain              conditions,    a   measure         of the force of the labour,
but I      am not aware that any one                         has hitherto        made       the simple
and     proper dynamometrical                   experiments              to decide the amount of
force      so exerted            by the accoucheur.             The problem may                be more
exactly         stated as          follows — If in
                                            :                an unobstructed         and powerful
labour, the accoucheur,                   by the directly            opposing pressure            of his
hand on the foetal                  head,    arrests       its progress for one or several
pains, he has             in    the pressure of his hand            a    force which, added to the
small amount                   required to effect          parturition, exceeds         all the com
bined powers                of labour in this          case.        He may then estimate by
dynamometrical experiment what was the force he used, or what
force      he   is       capable of applying           in the way in which he actually
applied      it      to arrest the progress of labour.                     This experiment may.
be varied        in different ways,             of which     I      may mention one.      Let us
suppose         a    case      of rigid vulva, the perineal resistance being over
come,       and          the     head    retroceding         during        the   interval      between
powerful bearing down pains.                         Now,      it   is   well known that in such
a   case   a    little manual           pressure    from above may be enough to push
the head         down again on the perineum, or to resist retrocession, or
that the first and painless part                    of the next pain will make the                 head
that has retroceded, again                      bulge out the perineum, before                     it   is
forced          by    the powerful          acme of         the pain against the resisting
vulva.          If, then, the practitioner                 opposes the advance of the head
even so         far as to bulge out the perineum, he must have                                a   nearly
exact measure                  of the force which           the labour could         bring      to bear
against the vulvar obstacle.
      In   such experiments or practice, what force does the accoucheur

372                  Proceedings of         the Royal Society
exert?      I  have a hand well accustomed to such work, and                   I  find,
by actual trial with an accurate dynamometer, 50 lbs. to be about
the highest power         I  can use, situated as      I am at the bedside      in at
tendance on a case.          I have ample reason, then, in such experience
to believe that very few of the most powerful labours exert a force of
50 lbs.   ;   that an ordinary       strong labour is easily arrested by               a
much smaller force than 50 lbs.           ;   that the great majority of labours
is accomplished         by repeated      efforts whose       highest power never
exceeds     25 lbs.     I may   add   that, in the great      mass of short forceps
deliveries, the force required from the accoucheur, even when he
delivers the head, unaided by the natural efforts,                 seldom    reaches
50 lbs.      These     statements      are,   to a great      extent, arbitrary or
dependent on my skill as an observer,               yet   I feel very confident       of
their accuracy.
    Again, the intelligent practitioner who               has observed     a case     of
difficult   labour finished      either by the long forceps or by podalic
extraction,     could not but form some rough idea of the force he
used, and      compare it with the force which the labour exerted in
its   nugatory     struggles.      The force which          the  accoucheur      thus
exerted would not be certainly the equivalent of what the labour
must have put forth in order to produce              a  spontaneous termination.
It   would, no doubt, in most cases surpass                  the force which the
mother must have exerted to produce the spontaneous birth.                         But
it would      be, nevertheless,      a  valuable measurement indicating                a
force which in such a case the labour failed to produce.                      Joulin
and    I  have    made      dynamometrical       experiments      to make use        of
such measurements in estimating               the highest power of labour.
    Another method of advancing our knowledge of this subject has
been followed       by the Rev. Professor Haughton.               This gentleman
does not, as his predecessors,          examine the effects       produced by the
powers    of labour,   and thus get results having a very distinct positive
value.      He follows a plan which may be justifiable,                yet which      is
difficult   and dangerous.        He takes      an   almost opposite method to
that used by me.            He  measures      the bulk and the extent of the
involuntary      and voluntary muscles employed in the function, and
from these data he arrives at conclusions which he in one particular
corroborates by       a  simple experiment.          The results arrived at         are
statements of the powers of the parts, which are true               if  his methods

                         of Edinburgh,             Session       1870-71.                          373
are    true.      Even      if   his methods are correct, the results                          are not
actual values,          but possible values, or statements of what may be,
not   of what has been.
  These         results are very different from those of Poppel, Tait, and
myself, and        it is     one    of the objects of this paper                 to inquire        into
their value.        In doing this,             I   shall not discuss the method, but
merely        examine the results, by the aid of any obstetrical light
which     I    can throw upon them.
  Before proceeding                 to this inquiry,           it is to    be remarked             that
Haughton arrives by his method at new results which the methods
of previous observers did not afford the means of reaching.                                       There
are, as   is universally known, two great forces employed in labour —
the uterine contractions and the involuntary and voluntary bearing
down.    The former of these forces is peculiar to the parturient
female.    The latter, as Haughton truly observes, is not peculiar to
parturition, but is
                      " available to
                                     expel feces, urine, or a foetus."
Haughton's plan              is,   to examine the uterus, measure                   it,   and through
this, arrive at         a    conclusion as to its power;                then to examine the
muscles which co-operate to produce bearing down, measure                                         them,
and through          this arrive at        a       conclusion     as to their power.                The
addition of the two results will, of course, give the power of labour.
AsI       have     already said, this          is    a   dangerous and difficult                plan to
follow,        and this       is    because        there    is   room     for       error     at every
step.
      The conclusions which Poppel                       and   Tait   and myself enunciated
regarding the power of natural parturition                            stand on        a     completely
different        and,   it   appears      to me, far more secure                 footing.         There
can, indeed, be scarcely any important                           difficulty raised regarding
 them.          The strength of the                foetal   membranes          is   ascertained by
 experiment.            Certain facts are well known regarding the rupture
 of the        membranes generally, and regarding                       their rupture in the
 labours        in which     the     membranes experimented                    on were        produced.
 These        two sets of data, when put together, lead by                                a   process   of
 reasoning,        which     it    would be tedious here to recapitulate, to con
 clusions regarding the lower limit of the power of natural labour,
 and regarding the power of labour generally, which cannot, so far
 as
  I      see,    be cavilled        at.   It   is   evident that this method tests only
 the    whole or the combined powers of labour.                           It   can afford no        hint

 as   to the comparative               value of the two forces                      which combine            to
 produce the power which is to be measured.
      The results given in Professor Haughton's                                  paper which appear
 to me to be both new and important                                 are three.      I   shall first   state
 them, and then proceed to their examination one by one : —
   1. The first conclusion   that " the uterine muscles are capable
                                           is,
 of rupturing the membranes in                         every case, and possess                in general
 nearly three times the amount of force requisite for this purpose."
 ....           "It    would be      a    waste of power (adds Haughton)                       to endow
the uterus with more force than                       I           have shown     it   to possess,     for   it
is    not necessary           that the uterus should complete the second stage
of labour, as the abdominal muscles are available for this purpose                                           ;
so that by using them, and not     giving the uterus more force than
is  absolutely necessary for the first stage of labour, an admirable
economy of muscular power            effected."      is" The extreme          ...
force of uterine contraction produces       pressure of 3-402 lbs. per
                                                                    a
square inch, which              is   equivalent to        a        pressure   of 54-106 lbs. acting
upon       a   circle of four and a-half inches in diameter,                                  which         is
assumed as the average                area of the pelvic canal."
     2.   The    second        of Professor             Haughton's            new and         important
conclusions           is,   that the action of the voluntary abdominal muscles
"   constitutes        the chief part of the force employed                                in difficult
labours."       ..."          The amount of available additional force given
out by the abdominal muscles admits of calculation, and will be
found much greater than the force produced by the involuntary
contractions of the womb itself."
     3.   The third conclusion               is,     " that,       on an emergency, somewhat
more than        a    quarter of      a   ton pressure can be brought to bear upon
a   refractory child that refuses to come into the world in the usual
manner."         ...         " Adding together the combined forces of                                  the
voluntary and involuntary                  muscles, we find —
            Involuntary muscles                  .            .           =      54"10 lbs.
            Voluntary muscles                    .        .               = 523-65 lbs.
                                            Total         .          .        577-75 lbs. av."
 I.       The first of Professor             Haughton's                  conclusions on       which   I
comment         is,   to the     effect     that the unaided uterine                      muscle can

                           of Edinburgh,         Session     1870—7     1-                375
exert      a force in labour         of   54 lbs., that this       force is employed in
dilating the cervix and rupturing the membranes, and that it can
or does effect         little   more.
     Now, it appears to me that Haughton                       limits far    too much the
use     of  the    power of the uterus.            I  have no doubt that the uterine
efforts not        only dilate the cervix            and   rupture the membranes in
most cases, but             also do, in     most cases, perform the chief part of
the     work required to bring forth the child.                      Although      I  do not
coincide        with Haughton            in his reflections        on the      economy      of
muscular power,             I  shall not discuss the point therein raised.                Yet
I    cannot      avoid saying that, in the present instance, his own state
ments invalidate              his reflections,      for he asserts       that the uterine
muscle has three times the amount of muscular                           power required to
 do the      work demanded of it.               In endowing the uterus with this
 great power, Haughton,                in my opinion,         furnishes    conclusive evi
 dence against his own view as to the use                    of  the contractions      of the
 uterus.         For     I  am sure     that the great mass            of births,    even   in
 difficult labours,         including only the most difficult, is             effected by a
 force      less than what          Haughton         ascribes to the uterine          muscle
 alone.        I  am satisfied that the whole combined                   powers of labour
 seldom       reach above 50 lbs., while Haughton gives the uterus alone
 a   power of 54.
      I  do not say        Haughton        is wrong    in supposing that the uterus
 can exert a force           of 54 lbs.      On the contrary,        I  have no reason to
 doubt it.         But I     am sure    that while easy labours require for their
  whole     work a force         scarcely exceeding          the    weight of the child,
 only a few         difficult    labours require for their whole work a force
 exceeding 50 lbs.
      Every accoucheur knows to some degree of exactness the force
  which is required to restrain                the   forward movement of the child
  when there        is no special resistance to its advance.                  This power      I
  have measured            approximatively         by dynamometrical          experiments,
  and    I  find    it   to be at the most 50 lbs.,          — a power less than what
  is  ascribed by Haughton              to   the unaided uterus. In other words,
  the uterus       and voluntary        muscles combined, stimulated              to violent
  effort   by insuperable          temporary resistance, exert             a  force greater
  than is     required to complete the labour;              yet this force is generally
  much less       than 50 lbs., and possibly never exceeds it.

 376                   Proceedings of      the    Royal Society
     It  is well-known       to accoucheurs that the          great resistance to the
 progress      of the child in the     second stage      of labour is what is called
  in obstetrics the perineum.            The power of this part I do not know,
 and guessing is a bad proceeding in a scientific paper.                     Yet   I  may
 venture to say that no perineum would long resist a force of 50
 lbs. repeatedly applied, a force less than Haughton                     ascribes to the
 uterine muscle.
     II.   Haughton's second conclusion is that the chief force in par
  turition     is furnished     by   the voluntary       muscles.        The    available
 power of these is (he says) 523 lbs., while that of the uterus is 54.
 The whole amount of expulsive               force of the      voluntary muscles is,
 he says, not usually employed to assist the uterus in                      completing
 the second stage         of labour;    but this does not contradict the con
 clusion we have ascribed to him.                  The conclusion is indeed, for
 Professor Haughton,           inevitable, for every accoucheur knows                 that
 the bearing down efforts, whatever may be their actual measured
 power,     are    very strong, perhaps       as strong as possible,          quite fre
 quently in ordinary labours.            Besides, Haughton himself expounds
 his meaning in the following words              : — " It  is plainly necessary that
 the first stage in the expulsion         of the    foetus should not be intrusted
 to a voluntary       muscle, and hence an involuntary               muscle is gradu
 ally provided, which takes the initiative and commences                        the pro
cess of parturition,        the  completion of which is then accomplished
by the aid of voluntary muscles, to the employment of which, at
this stage, no moral objection can be raised.                    It   is also necessary
(if   the Contriver       be allwise, or    if  the principle       of least action in
nature be true), that the involuntary                 muscle so produced, should
not possess more or less force              than is requisite for its purpose.
The     uterine muscle does not grow to meet a growing                        resistance
(as happens frequently in other cases), and its precise degree of
strength cannot be produced by a tentative process ; for in healthy
gestation the uterine muscle never tries its force against the mem
branes      it   is  called    upon to rupture        until   the    actual period      of
parturition       has arrived."
    The view expounded in these words has great authority on its
side beside that of the          quoted   writer, for the point therein           raised
as to the       relative   powers   and   uses     of  the   uterine and       auxiliary

                          of Edinburgh,           Session 1870-71.                                   377
forces of parturition is one that has been much discussed and for
a  long time.    The great Haller, indeed, held opinions which are
in accordance with Haughton's view.     This renowned physiologist
discarded the opinion                common in his day, and now almost uni
versally entertained, that the uterus is the main source of the power
exerted in every stage of parturition.
   Haughton gives us no reason for discrediting the general opinion
of obstetricians, relying apparently on his conclusions alone re
garding the comparative power of the two forces, that of the uterine
muscle and that of the assistant voluntary muscles. No doubt he
makes some              observations intended to be corroborative as to the
economy of force and other so-called laws of nature                                     ;        but such
reflections          cannot be regarded              otherwise than as premature by
those who, like myself, do not adopt this writer's conclusions upon
whose verity their justice depends.
      In        of his concise view of this question in his work on
             the course
Physiology, Haller twice takes care to express his doubts as to the
truth of his own opinions;                 and he ends by appealing to anatomists
for light upon the subject.                   This    appeal    is,   at least, ingenuous, for
his argument against the ordinary opinion rests greatly upon the
uterine fibres, their direction, and the direction of the force evolved
    by    them   ;   and, as   Haller's notions        on this anatomical point were
    very imperfect, and his mechanical ideas equally so, we need attach
    no weight to this part of his argument.                     Besides this, however,                 he
    has really nothing          deserving the name of good evidence on his
    side.     He thinks the         effects     produced by expulsive pains greater
    than the power of the uterus;                but this      is   evidently mere begging
    the question.         So also    is   his dependence,           for aid in his judgment,
on     a    picture of the great struggles of the voluntary muscles.
      Authors         generally     do,    as I      have   said,      entertain        an opinion
opposed to that of              Haller and Haughton.                They   are too numerous
to name,         and no one merits special mention;                    for, so far          as
                                                                                             I     know,
no one has            distinguished       himself by the novelty or elaborateness
of his arguments in support of the ordinary view that the uterus                                       is
    the     chief agent in      the whole process           of parturition,     and              that the
    voluntary muscles,           whether stimulated             by volition        or        by reflex
    excitement,       are, in
                           secondary position, aiding the uterus indeed,
                                a
    but   not supplying the chief force. There     no positive value in an
                                                                is

378                             Proceedings             of the Royal Society
argument of appeal to authority, yet it is evident that the amount
of authority                   against him made Haller hesitate to enunciate                                  his
own views             ;    and, when we consider the number, the                              intelligence,
and the acute attention of the obstetricians who form a                                             majority,
scarcely differing                    from the whole body,                   in favour of our view,
we    cannot but be weightily impressed in its favour.
  I must admit that some of the arguments made by obstetric
authors to do regular service in defence of their view are very
weak        or quite vain.                  I    may cite examples.               Cases   of parturition
completed when the uterus is prolapsed,                                     and is said to derive no
assistance            from bearing down efforts, are cited.                            But such cases
prove almost nothing, even supposing they are correctly described                                                ;
for there is in such cases absence                                of the ordinary difficulties                of
labour which consist in the propulsion                                      of the child through the
pelvis.          Cases of expulsion of the                       child after death of the mother
are quoted.                    But so far         as   I   have perused        them, they are given
with    a    deficiency of circumstantial                        data such as to invalidate them
altogether.                Indeed, it           is,   in some of them, not even shown that
the uterus acted at all                     ;    while in all there          is   the assumption          that
the difficulty of birth after death                         is   as great as before it.             The like
objections may be made to examples of labour in asphyxia, narco
tism, and syncope.                         It   has been asserted             also that narcotism by
chloroform affords evidence that the uterus                                    is   the chief agent in
parturition.                   But  I   must assert the incorrectness                 of this argument,
and  I      cannot understand why Haughton                                  should call attention to
the influence of this agent,                            for any argument from             it   is   valid, so
far as      it    goes, only against his own views.                               I   have,    in    a   large
experience, never seen chloroform                             inhalation   destroy the action of
the voluntary muscles.                     I      believe   it   generally weakens their action,
and   it    is   well known that, at the worst,                        it   only weakens the powers
of labour.                It   is   not known whether            it   weakens the uterine action or
the action of the voluntary muscles in the greatest degree.                                              If   it
does, as         is   alleged, when given profusely, destroy the action of the
voluntary muscles,                    it   certainly seldom            completely arrests the pro
gress   of labour.                   Lastly,     cases     of labour in paraplegic women                   are
cited in favour of the ordinary opinion.                               But fear they do
                                                                                  I                       not
even appear to favour                      it
                                            ;     and, with      a    view to the present question,
they cannot be held as settling anything,                                    seeing we do not know

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                             379
what influence paraplegia may exert on the uterus itself.                    Besides,
the cases are insufficient          in every   way.
    The arguments on which               I place   chief reliance are the follow
ing:—
    1.  The    great power of the uterus               felt  by the hand of the
accoucheur,      as   in the operation of turning, long after            the rupture
of the membranes.
    2.  The great and sufficient power of the uterus observed in cases
where the action of the voluntary muscles is weak or restrained.
    3. The regulating          influence of purely uterine pains in the pro
gress of the second stage of labour.
    4.  The supremely important demand for and presence of power
 ful uterine action after the expulsion of the child.
    5. The arrest of the progress            of labour by inertia of      the uterus.
This argument appears to me unanswerable, for the condition often
occurs when there is certainly only the slightest possible resistance
 to the   progress of the child, when the mother ardently desires the
 completion     of labour, and bears down violently with this object in
 view.
    6.  In  cases   of uterine inertia,       such   as are above     described,   the
 practitioner may find, by pulling with the forceps from below or
 pushing     with   the   hands from above,         in  the  absence   of all partu
 rient effort,   whether of the uterus or of the voluntary                   muscles,
 that a very small force, say not exceeding the weight of the child,
 is sufficient to finish      a  labour upon whose progress violent bearing
 down    efforts have had no effect.
    7.  The circumstance           that, were the voluntary muscles the chief
 agents,   expulsion      of the child would        be in great part a voluntary
 act,  which it certainly is not.
    8.  The asserted        completeness of the function          of parturition in
 animals in which          the    assistant bearing down efforts         are annihi
 lated by   opening the abdomen            ; the process being effected by their
 uterine and vaginal         muscles,     which are weak when compared           with
 that  of women.
    Baudelocque and Velpeau* relate cases which appear                       to show
 that woman      has very rarely voluntary power over              the progress     of
 parturition   for  a  time       Such cases offer no difficulty when regarded

380                       Proceeding* of             the     Royal Society
with a view to the present question.                              They      are explicable           in more
ways than one, and an illustrative                        statement            is,   for my present pur
pose, quite        sufficient.            Every experienced                    accoucheur           has seen
cases    where        voluntary           increase     of bearing down has sufficed                            to
expedite labours, which,                   if   the women             had       been left in a sleepy,
lethargic condition,                might     have      been protracted for an                     indefinite
length of time.
  There can              be    no    doubt      that        the      uterus       is   a   very powerful
agent in expelling                  the foetus from            its    cavity          into the world —
that    it   is   not the sole agent, and that                       it   is   assisted     by the action
of the voluntary muscles.                       Though      I     have not proved                 absolutely
that the uterus           is    the chief agent in the performance of this func
tion,    yet          have       no doubt that            it   is    so; and              think that the
             I I
                                                                                  I
arguments                have    adduced        give this belief of the profession the
highest degree             of probability.             This belief              does not          imply that
the aid afforded                by the voluntary               muscles          is    inconsiderable           or
unimportant.              It    only renders         it     quite incredible that while the
power of the uterus                  is   54 lbs. that of the voluntary muscles can
be 523.
   III.      Haughton's             conclusion,      on which              1    wish       last    of all      to
                          " that,                                                                      than
comment,           is,                on an         emergency, somewhat more                                     a
quarter of        a   ton pressure            can    be brought             to bear upon           a    refrac
tory child that refuses to come into the world in the usual manner."
   In my work entitled " Researches in Obstetrics,"                                        to which         Pro
fessor    Haughton              refers,   I   have     discussed            carefully,        but      briefly,
this point,        and         announce the conclusion that the comparatively
small figure of 80 lbs. gives the highest power of labour                                           ;    and I
quote     Joulin, who estimates                 it   at somewhat above 100 lbs.                         I     do
not deny that in exceptional circumstances                                 a    few pounds above 80
may be reached, but              I    feel    pretty sure that seldom in the history
of woman has the figure 80 been                              attained, whether on an emer
gency or not. This conclusion      arrived at by experiment and
                                                       is
observation — experiments on  the force  required to pull  child                                    a
through      a    contracted brim of pelvis, observations of the force used
to complete         a     difficult       labour, which nature, in its most violent
throes, has failed to accomplish.
   Every accoucheur will,                  I    suppose,          readily admit that, in                a   case

                              of Edinburgh,             Session        1870-71.                                381
of delivery             by podalic       extraction,        the       surgeon can exert a great
deal more              force to bring the child into the world than the most
energetic labour               can.         Now,       in these circumstances the surgeon
can use      no force nearly reaching to a quarter of a ton. A very
much       smaller power would rend the luckless body of the child in
pieces.
     Such a power as               a   quarter of a ton does, in my opinion, represent
a   force to which             the maternal machinery could not be subjected
without instantaneous                       and utter destruction.                 To   speak      of      a   rigid
 perineum              resisting such         a power,      or the fourth part of                      it,   would
 be   ridiculous.            The   possession        and use even        of   a    considerable portion
 of such         a      power would render                the forceps and the cephalotribe
 weak and useless                  instruments.           The mother could bray the child
 as   in   a    mortar, and squeeze               it   through    a    pelvis which would, under
 other         circumstances, necessitate Caesarean section.                                   Such    a     power
 would,         if     appropriately applied, not only expel the child, but also
 lift up the mother, the accoucheur, and                                     the    monthly        nurse all
 at once.              It   would be dangerous not only to the mother and the
 child     ;    it     would imperil          also      the accoucheur.              It      has   been         cal
 culated for me, that                  if   this force were            applied just as the chief
 resistance to delivery was overcome,                        the child would be shot out of
 the vagina at the rate of                        thirty-six feet       per second!*               The blow
 would be equal to the shock produced by the                                   fall of       the child from
 a    height of twenty-one feet.
      In   an early part of this paper                   I   have        said       that the method of
    inquiring into the subject which Haughton adopts                                      is   both difficult
    and    dangerous, and              I     think   I    have        said    enough to show that
    danger has not been                     avoided.      There must be error in Professor
    Haughton's calculation   of the power produced by the action of
    the voluntary muscles, or there must be error in judging of the
    application of this power to the accomplishment of the function,
    or there      must be error in both.                I   shall not attempt to show where
    the   error lies, but its occurrence does not astonish me; for any one
      *
         In making this calculation the child      taken as    lbs., the pressure as
                                                                 is                 7
    580 lbs.,and       supposed to be exerted through      space of three inches —
                        it
                        is                                                    a
    measurements which are fair statements    of the case.   It farther supposed        is
    that the friction     negligible when compared with the forward pressure.
                              is
    This   iscertainly the case     the forward pressure bo nearly as much as is
                                             if
    stated by     Professor Haughton as possible.

 382               Proceedings     of the Royal Society
 who has studied the difficult subject of the retentive power           of the
 abdomen    will recognise the difficulty of reaching conclusions as to
the power of labour by Haughton's method. It is highly probable
that the power of the voluntary muscle is dissipated, perhaps in
compressing intestinal gases, perhaps in consequence of being mis
directed.
   Whatever may be the real source of error as to this matter, it
is highly desirable to find it out, in order that we may, by more
accurate proceedings, arrive at the true results which Haughton
hoped to reach.

1.  On the Pentatonic        and other Scales employed           in Scottish
                Music.     By the Hon. Lord Neaves.
   Lord Neaves adverted      to the peculiarity which had been observed
in many Scotch airs, that they      are composed    on a pentatonic scale,
and do not make use of the fourth or seventh of the gamut.                  It
has been    said that these airs can be played on the black notes of
the pianoforte, which means that they can be played on the             key of
F$ major, of which    the fourth and seventh are represented         by white
notes, but are not needed.       He  also observed   that this class   of airs
could be played on the white notes of the piano, both in the key of
F  and in that of G.      They could    be played on    F,   because, as they
do not use the fourth,       they do not need         ; and they could      be
played on G, because,     as  they do not use the seventh,       they do not
need  Ff.    They could also, of course, be played on the key of C.

     Many minor airs can be played on the pentatonic scale of the
relative      major    ;   that    is,   airs on      D|   minor can be played on the
black notes, and airs in              A       minor can be played on the white notes
on the       pentatonic of        C ;     airs in    D   minor on the pentatonic of                F;

     Some     minor airs          are composed           on the pentatonic         of the tone
below.
      Specimens— "Adieu, Dundee" (in Skene MS.), "Blythe, Blythe."
      In several old pentatonic airs grace notes or transitional notes
have been added            in modern singing or playing, but the original
pentatonic          character can still be traced.
      Another       large class          of Scotch airs          are   composed        on   the    full
diatonic scale, and can be played entirely on the white notes with
out any       apparent modulation.
      When these airs are on the key of                         C   major, there       is   nothing
very peculiar          in them, and there are many of this class.                                  But
when         they    are    composed            on   other keys,        certain    peculiarities
appear.
      Several Scotch airs are composed                     in   the key of   G,   but played on
the     full diatonic      scale    of    C,   so as frequently to introduce           F    natural,
sometimes   with    pathetic, sometimes with
                           a                      comic effect.  The   a
               "                       "
old set of the   Flowers of the Forest   (Skene MS.)      an example              is
                                           "
of the one, and the tune of " Pease Strae    of the other.
      Other specimens are — "Bessie Bell," " Tullochgorum,"                                 "Loch-
aber no       more."
           in the diatonic scale are often singular, as, for instance,
      Minors
the air of " My boy, Tammie," played on the white notes.            It
runs into three keys —    minor,   Dmajor, and    major.
                                                     C                 F
      The pentatonic scale               is   not peculiar to Scotch music, but              it    may
partly be accounted for by the fact that rude wind instruments are
apt to be defective               in the fourth and fifth.              The simple diatonic
    scale,   without other semitones, may in like manner have been used

a   limited construction.
    Scotch         airs were          often        imitated     by introducing                 a particular
accentuation, called the Scottish " snap,"                                as in the           Vauxhall air.
"
    'Twas within             a   mile of Edinburgh Town."
    He expressed                 an opinion that many airs were common to Scot
land and the North of England,                             and      he denied that Scotch                  airs
were always sombre,                   as had sometimes been alleged.
    Airs illustrating                the    views above          stated       were      played      by     Mr
Bridgman in a manner of which it may be allowable to say that it
gave great satisfaction to the audience.

    These equations were                    communicated                 in   a       letter to Professor
Stokes, of date (probably January) 1858, and they were referred

    *These equations will be very conveniently called the Eulerian equations
of the   motion.    They correspond precisely to Euler's equations for the
rotation of   rigid body, and include them as a particular case. As Euler
               a
seems to have    been the first to give equations of motion in terms of co
ordinate components of velocity and force referred to lines fixed relatively
to the moving body,      will be not only convenient, but just, to designate
                               it
as " Eulerian equations" any equations of motion in which the lines of re
ference, whether for position, or velocity, or moment of momentum, or force,
or couple,     move with the body, or the bodies whose motion                              is   the subject.

                                 1.     On Thermo-electricity.
    Messrs     J.      Murray         and      J.    C.      Young   have       been      carrying              out
experimentally           the       idea mentioned                in my former             note on this
subject.  (Proc. Dec. 1870.) Their first sets of observations, of
the results of which    subjoin  specimen, were made with an
                                 I                       a
iron-silver       and an iron-platinum,                      circuit working        opposite          ways on
a   differential galvanometer.                      The resistances (including the                        galva
nometer coils) were in this particular experiment 53'1 and 25                                                    9
B.A. units respectively, so that but very slight percentage changes
could be produced in them by the elevation of temperature                                                  of   the
junctions.          As   one       of    a number            of closely agreeing               prebminary
trials the result         is   extremely satisfactory, though the exact                                   adjust
ment has not yet been arrived at.                               To show      the parabolas                due     to

nately after taking each reading of the complex arrangement.                                                    am!

the results; but,         as the        temperatures were probably slightly                           different
from those in the first columns, no very direct comparison                                                can     be
instituted.         A    glance at the 4th, 6th, and 8th columns,                                    however,

of junctions and galvanometer deflection has been arrived                                            at    in   the

 I        was     recently        led to        consider this            subject            by   Professor        A.
Dickson, who showed                       me some of his beautifully-mounted                               speci
mens,       and    explained to me the method he employs for the deter
mination of the divergence, and of the successive                                                leaves   of the
fundamental             spiral      or     spirals.          He referred           me to two terribly
elaborate         papers      by Bravais,* and               I   have      since met with another
 of    a    similar character by Naumann.f                                These             papers      certainly
cannot be supposed                 to present the subject from the simplest point
 of view.       I      do not doubt that the results                 I    have here arrived at are
 to be      found in some form or other in their pages, which are an
 nounced         as completely elucidating                     the question             ;   but  I      have     not
 sought for them, my sole object having been to put what seem to me
 the      elements of the matter                 as    simply and intelligibly                   as

                                                              into the straight
 line AO,   and by n steps from a in      a   left-handed spiral aO.           These
 spirals may in general be chosen          so that m and n are not              large
 numbers (3, 5, 8, 13, &c., being very common values);                     but   they
  must (and can always) be so taken that m spirals parallel to aO,
 and n parallel to AO, shall separately include all the leaves on the
 stem or cone.
    If m and n have       a common factor      X, there   will   be X  -    1 leaves
 (besides  A) which     are situated exactly on the        line Ao, and there
fore the   arrangement is composite,        or has X distinct fundamental
spirals.    If m'   and n' be the quotients     of  m and n by X, they are           to
be treated as m and n are treated below           ;  and this case thus merges
 into the simpler one, so that we need not allude to it again.
    It is obvious that, in seeking the fundamental               spiral, we must
choose the leaf nearest to       Aa   on the side towards O, as that suc
ceeding   A    or a.   The fundamental spiral will thus be right-handed
if P,   which is nearer to      A than  to a, be this leaf — left-handed              if
it  be p.   Of   course, we may have a left-handed fundamental                 spiral
in the former case, and       a  right-handed one in the latter          ;   but the
divergence in either will be greater than two right angles, and this
the majority of botanists seem to avoid.
    Draw PQ and pq respectively parallel to aO and AO, then the
requisite condition is that
                         -AQ    - PQ,       or

obvious that to get at           P  we must count         /i leaves along     AQ,   and  v
along    QP.       If, however, £ ^:       -,   count    v leaves     along aq, and fi
                                     v      n
along qp.       P,   or p, thus found is the next leaf            of the fundamental
spiral to    A  or a ; the next is derived from              it by   a second    applica
tion   of the   same process, and so on.
    There    is no necessity for restricting            the development, as given
above,    to  once   round the cone.         Suppose we go several times round
and   that A,    a, a, &c., are successive        positions of the same leaf.         The
processes     given above may be employed, and the                   results will be of
the same nature.            But this extension enables              us to obtain (more
and more approximately,             sometimes accurately) a right angle aAo,
where o is a leaf reached              after several turns of the fundamental
spiral.     This indicates that the            leaves    may be grouped (approxi
 mately or accurately) in lines parallel to the axis of the stem or
 cone.     When this        can   be done      accurately, it is easy to         see  that
 (since one of n,       - ,  is greater, and the other less, than the number
 of leaves     in  one turn     of  the fundamental          spiral) the difference of
 azimuth of two successive leaves of that spiral must be expressible
 in the form
                                          rm + sn
 where s and      r  are necessarily very small positive integers in all the
 ordinary cases of phyllotaxis,           since they are the numbers of leaves
 in  Ali,  Ho, respectively, which are portions of the spirals on which
 or parallel to which, m and n were measured.
    The fraction
                                         rp   + sv
                                        rm + sn
  has been     called the divergence of the fundamental                  spiral.   Of its
  constituents the numbers m, n, r,            s  are at once given by inspection
 of any cone or stem,             and   (from     m   and     n) /x  and   v  are easily
 calculated.
    To extend this investigation            to the cases in which the divergence
 is  altered by torsion of the cone,             it is merely necessary         to notice
 that such      a process      alters only r and       s.     It produces,     in fact,  a
 simple shear in the developed            figure.

394                 Proceedings        of the Royal Society
Added, March 20th, 1871, in            consequence      of   some remarks      made    by
                Professor Dickson at the Meeting of that date.
   It is obvious that if the same leaf, O, be reached from                      A by   m
steps of   a right-handed,       and n of a left-handed, spiral (such that n
of the former and in of the latter contain, severally,                 all  the leaves),
another common leaf can be reached                by m    —   n steps of the right-
handed    spiral, and n steps of a new left-handed                 one (these    spirals
possessing the same property of severally containing, in groups of
n and m      - n respectively, all the leaves).               This process may be
carried on, when m and n are prime to one another, until we have
steps represented by       1  and 1, in which        case we obviously arrive at
the leaf of the fundamental            spiral next to A.          It  is better,   how
ever, to carry the process only the length of steps 1 and t, where t
is determined      by the condition that         1  aud    t + 1  would give spirals
both right-handed        or both left-handed.
   Now, in the majority of cases of fir-cones, it seems that we have
t, found in this way,        =  2, i.e., there are    less   than   three leaves    in a
single turn    of the  fundamental spiral.          It is of course obvious that
there can never be less than two, and the case of exactly two
corresponds to the simplest of all possible arrangements, that in
which the leaves        are placed alternately           on opposite sides        of the
stem.     Fir-cones, therefore, give in general the airangement next
to this  in order of simplicity.           Hence, for such cones, and for all
other leaf arrangements which are based on the same elementary
condition, the values of m and n for the most conspicuous spirals
must be of the forms
                               2 ,    3 ,   5 ,   8 ,     Ac.,
                               1,     2,    3,     5,     &c.
   These simple considerations             explain      completely       the   so-called
mysterious appearance          of terms of the recurring             series   1, 2, 3, 5,
8, 13, &c., &c.       The other natural series, usually but misleadingly
represented     by convergents         to  an   infinitely extended continued
fraction, are easily explained as above by taking t = 3, 4, &c, &c.
As a purely mathematical question it is interesting to verify the
consistency of the statements just made, where the change in t is
introduced, with those above made as to the effects of torsion in
altering r and s. But this may easily be supplied by any reader
who possesses a small knowledge of algebra.

            Dr CHRISTISON, President, in the Chair.
    The following Communications                  were read     : —
1.    Account of the Extension of the Seven -Place Logar
    ithmic Tables, from 100,000 to 200,000.                         By Edward
    Sang, Esq.
                                       Abstract.
    In this   paper the details were given          of the computations made
for extending the Table            of Seven-Place      Logarithms      to 200,000
and    of the precautions taken            to ensure accuracy in the printed
work.
    The calculations       were   originally intended for     a Nine-Place   Table
to One     Million  ;  and the manuscript shows the logarithms to fifteen
places, with their first and second differences for all numbers from
 100,000    to 200,000.
 2.   On the Place        and Power         of Accent in Language.               By
                                 Professor Blackie.
     Professor Blackie then read a paper           on   " The Place     and Power
 of Accent in Language."             On the subject of accent and quantity,
 he remarked, especially in          relation   to the learned languages,        the
 greatest    confusion     had    prevailed,   and   the   existing  practice was
 altogether unreasonable and anomalous.                In articulate    sound   four
 things had to be       distinguished — volume       or bulk, force or emphasis,
 elevation and depression, and prolongation               or duration.     English
 scholars had shown an unhappy incapacity                   of not being    able to
 distinguish     between     stress and prolongation, and thus had been led
 to introduce the general practice of pronouncing               Greek with Latin
 accents.     In laying     down the principles     by which syllabic accentua
 tion   is guided,     four points      are  to be attended to — significance,
 euphony,     variety, and convenience.           Fashion, of course, and cus
 tom have wide       i-wa_v  in this domain;      but  in  the original   structure

390                 Proceedings of       the  Royal Society
of language we have to look to significance                   and    euphony rather
than arbitrary       usage,   as the main causes            which determined the
place   of the accent.      In  compound words it was natural that the
qualifying or contrasting element should               be   emphasised, as in the
proper Scotch        pronunciation      of Balfour (Coldtown), where the
accent lies on that element of the word which distinguishes it from
other Bah or towns.            As to euphony,        those    languages are least
euphonious which, like English and Gaelic, have                     a  preference for
the    ante-penultimate       accent,   while     those     are   most euphonious
which, like Latin, Greek, and Italian, abound                    in penultimate       or
ultimate     accented    syllables.     In   respect    of euphony,          as well  as
variety, the Greek language was superior to the Latin, in that it
allowed the accent        on   any of the three        last places,      while    Latin
allowed it only on the penult and ante-penult.                      The attempt to
make out a special and exceptional               case for Greek accents            were
vain.     It  is perfectly clear from the statements of the ancient
Greek grammarians,           that the Greek acute            accent    consisted not
only in the raising of the voice on the syllable, as Professor Munro
imagines, but in a greater emphasis or stress.                The prejudice which
has so long existed against the use of Greek accents arose partly
from mere carelessness,        partly from     a  notion that the observance          of
the accent would interfere with the proper quantity                   of   the vowels,
and destroy     the beauty of classical verse.           But this notion is alto
gether unfounded, as classical verse, originally an inseparable part
of musical science, was not governed             in any respect by the spoken
accent, but guided entirely by the rhythmical                   ictus or time-beat.
Practically,    there was no difficulty in reading Greek prose by the
accent, and Greek poetry by the quantity.                  In  the  /xtXcxs,  or purely
musical part of the drama, the spoken               accent naturally fell away.
In recitation     a sort   of compromise probably took place, which is
perfectly easy of execut ion.         The paper included         a history or review
of the doctrines of learned men and great scholars on the subject of
Greek accentuation,         from Erasmus          down to        Chandler,      Munro,
Clark, and Geldart.          It  was astonishing       that such confusion and
beating the air about imaginary difficulties should have so long pre
vailed on a matter comparatively so simple               ;  but there was not the
slightest doubt that the moment our classical teachers should recur
to  living   nature, instead    of being governed       by dead tradition in this

                        of Edinburgh,            Session 1870-71.                         397
matter, the present monstrous, pernicious, and perplexing                            practice
of reading Greek with Latin accentuation must cease.                          Independent
of its absurdity,       the loss of time occasioned by teaching one accent
to the     ear,    and another to the understanding,                   should be motive
enough      for all teachers      to deliver our classical schools from a yoke
which, originally imposed by sheer laziness, is now supported only
by ignorance,         prejudice, and the tyranny of custom.

 D.   MILNE            HOME, LL.D., Vice-President, in the Chair.
    The following Communications                       were read        : —
        1.    Notice of Exhibition of Vegetable Spirals.                           By
                         Professor Alexander Dickson.
   Dr Dickson exhibited              a number of specimens, chiefly               Fir   Cones
and    Cacti, illustrating the principal                series     of vegetable spirals.
Almost all the cacti and many of the                     cones     were from the Edin
burgh Botanic Garden and the Museum of Economic Botany there.
As the nomenclature              of the cacti in the Edinburgh garden, as in
many other botanic gardens, is in a state of considerable confusion,
the specific        names    will not      be referred to, and the generic ones,
even, must         in  some    cases be held as only approximately                   correct.
 This, however, is of the           less consequence         as the phyllotaxis       of such
 plants      is  eminently       variable      even   in the       same     species.      Ten
 different series or systems of spirals were illustrated by specimens,
 of which the following may be noted.

whorls of seven          ;      two presented thirteen              verticals, from   a

   The author referred to the paper which he had read on the ter
races  of the Earn          and      Teith,* and then described similar deposits
which he had observed last autumn on the Spey, giving examples
with drawings, from the neighbourhood of Kingussie, Dalvey, and
Ballindalloch.        The arguments formerly adducedf were equally con-

elusive in the Spey to show that these terraces were not old sea
beaches   nor lake margins, but the fluviatile deposits of some former
epoch   when the floods rose to                 a   greater height        The problem then
came to be,       In   what way are we to explain the action of the river
in throwing up deposits 60, 80 feet, or even more above its bed                                     ?
There are two ways, in one or other of which this may be accounted
for, — either by supposing the river bed to have lain on its present
level, and allowing rainfall sufficient to flood the channels up to the
requisite height       ;   or by supposing the bed of the stream to have been
formerly at a higher level, and that, after forming the terraces,                             the
current had excavated its bed down to where it now is.                                 It   is the
second of these views which has found most favour among geologists,
and various suggestions have been offered                        as to how the bed          of the
stream was formerly elevated.
  One explanation            is,   that at the time of the highest terrace,                   the
line of the valley, then comparatively shallow, was occupied by the
original rock, still         to    a    great extent in situ.             In regard to our
Scottish valleys this explanation                    is   inadmissible.       It   was formerly
shown, from the position of the boulder clay,* that the rocky struc
ture of these river-courses had been hollowed out nearly as deep as
now previously to the formation of the terraces     but apart from        ;
the Boulder clay the terraces                   themselves, as will be shown, prove
the same thing, for example, the 70 feet terrace at Kingussie.
  Another explanation                  is,    that during      the   last submergence of
Scotland the valleys had been filled by marine gravels, &c., and
that the river         bed    had been thus               lifted to the requisite height.
This view, however, must                     also be set aside, because after that sub
mergence,     the valleys of Scotland were occupied by glaciers, which
must to   a       great extent have cleared out these previous marine
deposits.f             must this have taken place in Strathspey,
                  Especially
lying so high above the sea, and connected with the central moun
tain-masses of the country.                    The glacier must have ploughed                 out
the marine debris.           It    was after that the terraces            were formed.
  There      is
              a     third suggestion, that the river had raised itself                         on
its own alluvium, formed the terraces, and then re-excavated its

bed.      But here, again, the objections are equally decisive. First,
the    raising of a river bed in this way seems to take place only when
the current has reached            some comparatively level part of its course,
as in    the   Po or Nile.      The Spey is remarkable for            the steep incline
of its bed.                                      *
                  The Ordnance Survey shows that for nearly 30 miles
below     Grantown it      goes down       more than 600 feet, — fully 20 feet a
mile.      The current is strong, the old terraces are high. The idea
is  not for a moment to be thought of that it could have acted as the
sluggish rivers which silt up their beds.                  But, secondly, how did the
river,    after silting up its bed, and raising itself, come              to change its
action, and cut its way down?                  Is any such case on         record appli
cable to any        river course        as a whole ?        If  such a revolution       of
river action       be   exceptional,        or  if it   be unknown      in nature, we
should surely not be warranted in applying it to the rivers of Scot
land    generally at the period of the            terraces.
     Thus the idea that the river bed              had    formerly been elevated is
encompassed        by difficulties.        In whatever form the explanation is
put, objections       at once suggest themselves which would appear                     to
be    fatal.
     Turning to the other view, that the river had                  flowed    on its pre
sent level, we find that the one great difficulty                 is the vast amount
of water which would be needed to flood the channels up to the
 requisite height.         Mr Prestwich, referring to the Somme and some
 English rivers, has calculated that it would require 500 times the
 present     flow of the stream to form the 80 feet terrace.              f    When    we
 look    closely into the matter, however, this difficulty                   diminishes.
 The result of 500        : 1  is obtained by taking the present flow of the
 Somme        at 800 square        feet   sectional area.        That   represents    the
 river when not in flood.             As the     80 feet terrace,      however, is ad
 mittedly the work of the old river when in flood, we must take the
 present     Somme also in flood, and that is not 800 but 3000 square
 feet (Prestwich).+          The effect of this first correction is to bring
 the 500      : 1 down to 133         : 1.    But, further, when         Mr Prestwich
 comes to put      all the facts together,         he estimates the old Somme          at
 a  little more than      five   times the present — 16,000§ against            3000   of

sectional area — and the result                is,   that      if     we compare his own view
with that which he ascribes to               h  is    opponents, the 133                  :   1   is   further
diminished to 25       :   1.      But 'there        is   a   still   more important fact to be
taken into account.               In calculating the sectional                       area      of the old
river the whole valley            is   assumed       as empty         ;    but this    it     cannot have
been, at least here in Scotland.               If the         rocky structure of the valleys
was excavated,         and      the    rock removed,                  how shall           the floods be
raised high enough to form the terraces?                                       There       only        remain
water and alluvium           to   fill the     space.           The only reasonable view                    is
that the area of the valley was to                   a    large extent occupied by masses
of alluvium       since removed.             And this             is      borne out by what we
actually find — fragments of old gravelly platforms left standing                                           to
tell of deposits which evidently were at one time far more extended.
A third correction, not less important than the others, must be on
this ground applied to Mr Prestwich's calculation.      So far from
the valley having been empty,                  it    must to          a   great extent have been
filled with alluvial deposit since denuded.                                The difficulty              raised
as to the     volume of the old floods               is   thus to     a    great extent set aside.
   At various points along the Spey — Kingussie, Coulnakyle, Crom-
dale — transverse sections of the valley were given, showing the
height of the terraces.    From the width of the valley in these
cases   (of which details           were given)           it    appeared           that   a   calculation
like that of      Mr Prestwich in               the Somme would bring out results
equally incredible as to the old floods, but owing to the above cor
rections this difficulty  removed, and the remarkable thing
                                  is                            that                                   is
the 70 feet terrace at Kingussie                 has been laid open in an old river
course,      and the 80 feet terrace           at Cromdale                in   a   railway cutting          so
as to bring out similar results to those formerly shown from the
valley of Monzie.* Explain the matter how we may, the river,
with an open valley three-fourths of     mile wide, has begun at the
                                                           a
bottom, on the level of its present bed, and piled up these deposits
to the height of 70 or 80 feet.   That they are the work of the
river  proved by the way in which the platform-like surface of the
        is
terrace slopes down the stream.
  The idea of ascribing                these     high-lying terraces simply                            to the
greater floodingpower of some former time was suggested by                                                  a
comparison between the deposits of the Ruchil with those of the

Upper Earn, and of the terraces of Loch Lubnaig with those of
Loch Earn, as formerly explained.*                         It   is confirmed by the terraces
of the Spey, and more especially by the failure of all the other ex
planations.
     Our knowledge of this whole series of deposits is                               as   yet far too
imperfect to allow of anything like                    a   complete theory of their for
mation.         If   a suggestion      might be offered,                perhaps the course of
events     may       have      been   something        like this.           When the glacial
epoch ended, and the covering                of   ice and snow melted off Scotland,
there would be no small amount                   of debris over the              face of the coun
try, and, unprotected              by vegetable covering, it would be washed
down      into the valleys.           Every      one admits that the rivers of that
age were        larger than now — how much larger it                         is difficult to say.
If the Spey had five times its present volume (as Mr Prestwich
suggests in the case of the Somme) it would, judging from the
present forceof its current, assuredly                      keep its central channel open
whatever the amount of debris which                             came    down into the valley.
River-like, it would form its banks,                   and spread out its haughs up to
the     height       to which     its floods could rise, when confined to its com
paratively narrow channel.                In the case supposed that height may
have been great            ;   and these old high terraces may be the fragments
of   alluvial platforms, which             once spread out along the valley, where
the old floods had raised them.                    Before the whole facts are fully
explained, it seems probable that our ideas of the amount of water
present     in    these old floods may have to be enlarged.
   The bearing of these facts on certain arguments for the an
tiquity of man was considered, with special reference to the Spey
deposits.            There are gravel beds along the Somme                                 in France,
which,      up to the             height    of    80       feet,       contain     flint    weapons,
which are held to be of human manufacture;                                  and the argument
 is,   that the river has excavated through                            the rock the valley in
which      it    now flows      — that this      has been done since the deposition
of the gravels, and to allow time for such excavation their age, and
consequently the human period, must be carried back into                                        some
vast antiquity.
       But here      is   an important     fact, which             the deposits of the Spey
 make     still more clear in         some    respects          than those of the Earn and

404                Proceedings of         the   Royal Society
Teith.    Along our Scottish rivers there               are similar     high gravels,
80 feet    or more above        the   stream    ;   and   it is known that, pre
viously to the time of their formation, the rocky structure of our
valleys had already been hollowed out nearly as deep as now. This
is  shown   at Kingussie,     where      the 70 feet        terrace — and at Crom-
dale,  where the 80 feet           terrace— are seen          resting on the rock
nearly on a level with           the   river-bed.       If,  then, with    the rocky
bed down on its present level, the Scottish               streams have managed
somehow to form those      high-lying       deposits,    why may not the French
rivers have done the same?               In  that case, the Somme           would re
quire no time for the      subsequent excavation of its valley, and the
human period, so far      as  this argument is concerned, may not be so
long after all.
   The force of this does not depend on the correctness of the views
stated  above as to the      formation of these terraces.               Whatever was
the way in which the Scottish rivers went to work, it was after the
rock had been excavated,         and the question would still be, why may
not the French rivers have done the same?
   One point seems clear, that the case of the French                   gravels must
be  shown to differ from those of Scotland before                  the advocates     of
extreme antiquity can prove their case from the Somme.                          After
admitting     the  case  in Scotland,        if   a distinction    is to be made in
regard to France, the burden of proof will lie with them.                         The
probabilities    would certainly        seem to be        against them.        Rivers
and   valleys    have the same laws in different                 countries.    If  the
French rivers be alleged to have acted differently from the Scottish
it may have     been so, but the grounds           of the difference would       need
to be adequate,     and    the proof clear.            In the present       case, the
alleged distinction     has     reference altogether to the excavation of
the rock.     In France, they say it had to             be done     subsequently to
the time of the terraces      ;   in Scotland, it must be admitted to have
been done before.      Are there any grounds on which such a distinc
tion can be made good?              Was there such         a difference   in the  for
mation of valleys between Scotland and France?
   It will  not be alleged that the soft texture of the chalk rock
of the Somme,      as contrasted with our harder rocks, can form the
ground of distinction.        In France itself the            same   valley-systems
traverse many different kinds of rock.

  Nor can it              be said that the submergence of Scotland                    as con
trasted      with the      area   of the Somme, which          was not submerged, can
constitute          the difference, for Mr Prestwich            has shown*         not only
that the French              system      of valleys   has crossed         into the south of
England, but that it prevails indifferently as much beyond as within
the line of submergence traced by Sir C. Lyell. That submergence
seems in this respect to make no difference.
  It    is equally in vain to allege that the large amount of alluvium
in the  Scottish valleys makes such a ground of distinction when
contrasted with the lesser amount of such deposits on the Somme.
The alluvium              along our Scottish streams is         a    very variable quan
tity as between valley and valley, and as between                         different portions
of the same valley.               On the other hand, the amount of the Somme
gravels at Amiens and above                           great — so great, that both Mr
                                                it,
                                                is
Prestwich and Sir Charles Lyell argue in favour of their antiquity,
from the length of time which must have been needed to accumu
late such      a    volume of debris.     f      On the Oise also, and some neigh
bouring streams, the amount of alluvium                   is   described as very great.
  It    is   enough, however, to remark, that the burden of proof lies
with the advocates             of antiquity,      and that its difficulties       have       not
been surmounted.              On the other hand, there         is thing which they
                                                                    one
may fairly be asked               to do —  if   they maintain that the French and
Scottish valleys have been formed on different principles                        — to show
where the two systems                   meet.  The French method,               as we have
seen, crosses         into England.         No one will maintain that          the Scottish
stops     at the Tweed.            Somewhere they must come in contact.                       It
would be instructive              if   some one would try to show us two conter
minous valleys wrought on the opposite plans.                        The attempt would
probably evince the impossibility            of drawing such a distinction.
In all that          is   important, the French and Scottish valley systems
go together.
   The whole of            these remarks are submitted as suggestions, show
ing the need of much more complete investigation.                            On this whole
series of deposits we have               much to learn, — far       too much to admit of
anything like confident conclusions being drawn as yet.                           The only
safe course   to await the results of future research.

     If difficulty     be   still felt in regard        to the amount of water required
for those old floods, we might appeal to the kind of proof by which
the existence of a former glacial epoch in Scotland is established.
Who that looked to the present ice and snow of a Scottish winter,
could think it likely that glaciers once filled the valleys of the
Pentlands,        and       that masses of moving ice rose over the flanks of
Arthur's     Seat.          We point      to the       rounded and striated rocks, and
say, there are the            foot-prints of the old glacier, — and the                 thing is
proved,     no matter             how different        may be the     cold of our present
winters.      And       why not reason           thus in regard to the old floods ?
Who that looks              on the present             could realise
                                                     flow of our streams
floods able to raise those old 80 feet terraces?   But   why should
we not point to these deposits where they lie, and say, these strati
fied gravels and bedded sands are the workmanship of the old                                     cur
rents, which           once       swept and eddied at that height                 down these
valleys.      If     this kind of evidence makes               you believe in the great
old glacier all unlike our present ice, why should not similar proof
make you believe in the great old floods of a former epoch,                                       all
unlike though they may be to our present streams ?
  And yet in Strathspey, with the traces of the Moray floods all
around us, it is easier to believe these things than it would be
almost anywhere else.   It was at Coulnakyle, the scene of one of
these     drawings, that Captain                M'Donald,     R.N.,   a sailor     of   the      old
school, looked out and saw the Spey, about a mile wide, covered
with waves, that put him in mind of Spithead in                            a   fresh gale, and
felt sure, as he told Sir T. D. Lauder, that he could have sailed a
fifty-gun ship from Boat of Garten to Bellifurth,                      a   distance of seven
miles.      The small burn of Drumlochan, which in its ordinary                              state
" is hardly sufficient to keep                 the saw-mill going," rose          till it   swept
away two bridges of twenty                    feet span, the column of water being
estimated at 400 square feet sectional area.                      As the miller of Dal-
                              "   the height the burns rose to that day was
nabo expressed          it,                                                                   just
a'   thegither ridiculous."              In    looking back to the time of these old
deposits,    it   is   generally admitted that the volume of the rivers was
decidedly greater than              it   is   now.     Mr Prestwich,       as we have        seen,
assumes that the old Somme was five                         times the present.              If    we
might suppose           something like this in the Spey —   further, there if,
was along the           valley an amount of alluvium sufficient to confine

       Membranes in the Cetacea.    By Professor Turner.                                                *

     In   this memoir the author described the dissection of the gravid
uterus of an Orca gladiator, for which he was indebted to                                 Mr James
Gatherer of Lerwick.                 The paper contained                     an account        of the
uterus and appendages,                  the     foetal    membranes,           the   position     and
general form of the foetus, and                    a     comparison of the placentation
with that of other mammals possessing the diffused form of pla
centa.       The structure of the uterine mucous membrane, its                                    sub
division      into   a   gland layer and          a   crypt layer, the relations of the
glands to the crypts, their structure, the arrangement of their blood
vessels, and the much greater vascularity                         of the crypts than of the
glands, were especially described.                  The chorion, though with diffused
villi,    possessed      not only   a   small non-villous part at each pole, but                    a
third larger bare spot opposite the os uteri internum                          ;   the non-villous
spots corresponded, therefore, to the                       three uterine orifices.               The
arrangement and structure of the villi, the relations of the vessels
to    them and to the chorion generally were described                          the plexus

part of the chorion, from this latter plexus the rootlets                            of the umbi
lical vein arose.          The intra-villous capillary plexus lay in relation
to the      system of capillaries situated                  in the walls of the uterine

situated beneath the plane of the general uterine mucous surface.
The amnion formed         a continuous bag from one horn        of the chorion
to the other, but did not reach the poles         of  the latter.   In the left
horn, which contained the foetus, it extended to 2 inches, in the
right   to 9 inches from the corresponding           pole of the chorion, its
free surface was studded with small pedunculated corpuscles.               The
allantois     was   not so extensive      as   the amnion.        The urachus
expanded into a large funnel-shaped sac, which bifurcated when                it
reached     the   chorion and formed a right and left cylindrical horn         ;
the left reached      to 7 inches from the left pole      of the chorion, the
right  to 21 inches from the      right  pole.
   2.  Note on some Anomalous              Spectra. By H. F. Talbot.
    A recent number of Poggendorff's         " Annalen " contains a short
but interesting paper by Christiansen,          of Copenhagen, in which he
states    that a    hollow prism filled with the alcoholic solution of
fuchsine produces a highly anomalous spectrum, which, instead                 of
 proceeding regularly from the red to the violet like the ordinary
 solar spectrum, stops at a certain point, returns backward, then
 stops again and resumes       a direct course to the end.       This paper by
 Christiansen, kindly pointed out to me by Professor Tait, recalls to
 my memory an experiment which I formerly made more thau
 thirty years ago, and which, with the permission of the Society, 1
 will briefly describe, premising, however, that I write from memory,
 and without access at present to the original paper which            I believe
 I  have    still preserved.    My account may therefore contain some
 inaccuracies, but the general nature of the experiment was as
               I
 follows : — prepared some square pieces of window gless, about an
 inch square.                             I
                   Taking one of these, placed upon it a drop of a strong
                                                      I
 solution of some salt of chromium, which, if remember rightly, was
 the double oxalate of chromium and potash, but it may have been
 that substance more or less modified.          By placing a second square of
 glass on the first, the drop was spread        out in a thin film, but it was
 prevented from becoming too thin by four pellets of wax placed at the
 corners of the square, which likewise served to hold the two pieces
 of glass together.       The glasses were then laid aside for some hours

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                                              409
until crystals formed in the liquid.                        These were necessarily thin,
since their       thickness         was        limited     by the interval            between        the
glasses.       Of     course       the    central part of each crystal, except the
smallest ones, was bounded by parallel planes, but the extremities
were bevilled at various angles, forming so many                               little prisms, the
smallest of them floating in the liquid.                            When         a   distant candle
was viewed        through these glasses, having the little prisms inter
posed, a great number of spectra became                              visible, caused           by the
inclined       edges.       Most of these were no doubt very imperfect, but
by trying the glass at various points, some very distinct                                      spectra
were met with, and these could with some trouble be isolated by
covering       the glass with a card pierced with                         a   pin-hole.        It    was
then seen that each prism (or oblique edge of crystal) produced two
spectra oppositely polarised and widely separated.     One of these
spectra was normal             ;   there was nothing           particular about it.                 The
colours of the other were very anomalous, and, after many experi
ments,     I   came to the conclusion that they could only be explained
by the supposition that the spectrum, after proceeding for a certain
distance, stopped short and returned upon itself.
      No accurate measurements,                     however,     were         made,       because      it
always happened that, after the lapse                          of    a minute          or two, the
crystals dissolved in the surrounding liquid, owing to the warmth
of    the hand        or eye.            The    presence    of the liquid,            however,       was
 necessary      to give the crystals                 the requisite            transparency,         and,
 moreover,      the liquid virtually diminishes                     the    angle of the prism
floating in       it,   which otherwise would be too great to give                             a    good
result.    I     never published                this experiment,           because    I      found    it
delicate and capiicious, and                   I   was reluctant          to publish       any facts
 that might be difficult for others to verify.                             But   I    have     several
 times described         it   to   Sir D. Brewster in conversation, and                    he always
said that he thought               it   very important, at the same time suggesting
 that there might perhaps                   be some fallacy.              This   was because          he
 doubted the possibility of                a     spectrum being partially inverted or
 returning       on      itself.         But this doubt        seems          now    to   be   wholly
 removed       by Christiansen's               experiment, in which there seem to be
 two inversions          in the spectrum, and therefore               I       no longer hesitate
 to   state the         grounds on which            I    concluded long ago that this
phenomenon was possible.

   Writing entirely from memory, it               is possible that    I  may have
fallen into some inaccuracies in this brief account, which, if it
should be the case,      I trust the Society will, under the circumstance,
kindly excuse.
   P.S. — Since the above remarks were written, the first number of
                                " for the
Poggendorff's " Annalen                      present year has been received in
 Edinburgh.       This contains a long article by Kundt on the subject
of Christiansen's experiment.
   He finds that anomalous spectra are given by nil the aniline
colours, and by permanganate of potash. Such spectra turn back
upon themselves, generally having the green at one extremity, the
blue being situated between the green and the red.
   Hence this property is possessed by an extensive class of bodies,
and must form a new and separate              brancb of optics.      He  says   that
the phenomenon only occurs when                 a very strong solution       of the
substance    is employed in the form of a liquid prism of 25°.                   But
only the thin extreme edge of the prism is available, the thickness
of the rest rendering it opaque.            He failed in    the attempt to form
a solid prism by       mixing collodion with the alcoholic solution, but
this might perhaps be achieved by other means.                  In the meantime
a  wide field of experiment is open.

      1. On Anomalous         Spectra, and on a simple Direct-vision
                                  Spectroscope.
   When    I  first saw Le Roux's account of his very singular dis
covery of the abnormal refraction of iodine vapour,                I was   inclined
to attribute the phenomenon to something similar to over-correction
of an achromatic combination.             In   fact, if a hollow prism be filled
with   a mixture      of  two   gases   or vapours, one       of which is more
refractive than air, the other less refractive;                while   the   second
body   is more     dispersive than       the first   ;  it is  easy   to see    that
Le Roux's result might           be obtained, although         each of the sub
stances  employed is free from anomalous refractive properties.                   In
a recent conversation with         Mr Talbot,      I happened     to mention the
subject, and     I learned    from him his remarkable observation just
laid before the Society.        I  have   lince,   when   I had an opportunity,

                      of Edinburgh,, Session 1870-71.                                   411
made several trials with hollow prisms and prismatic vessels, using
various substances, such          as    oils of cassia       and turpentine,          toluol,
alcohol, saturated solutions of salts, &c., with the view of imitating,
with nearly transparent          substances,        the singular      results obtained
by Talbot, Christiansen,          and Kundt.             The observations      are cer
tainly very       easy in one sense, though very laborious in fact                ;    but   I
have already produced a spectrum doubled on itself, and have no
doubt that with patience          I shall      be able to produce one with two
and even more inversions;              though, of course, the more numerous
are the inversions the smaller is the scale of the whole phenomenon.
The      easiest method seems to be to put into a hollow prism a                       mix
ture of two substances of very different refractive                     powers,       and to
immerse it in a prism or trough containing                     a   substance of inter
mediate refractive power.          When        a   trough is employed, an external
glass prism may with advantage be used along with the combina
tion.  The sought phenomenon      of course, obtained best near the
                                            is,
point of adjustment for achromatism, and       in fact very closely
                                                              is
connected with the investigations of Dr Blair in his attempts to
improve the achromatic telescope by using fluid lenses.
     One of my hastily set-up combinations                 (of two liquids only)        gave
me   a    direct-vision    spectroscope     complete, more          powerful than one
of Browning's excellent instruments with five glass prisms, and                           I
have little doubt that in this way very good results may be obtained.
But,     ifit   be needful to examine only         a    small region of the spectrum
at   a   time, practically unlimited dispersion may be obtained by using
so very simple       a    combination      as two approximately          isosceles      flint
prisms of small angle with their edges together and their adjacent
faces inclined at an angle approaching to 180°, so as to form hollow          a
prism to be filled with oil of cassia.                  In fact, the dispersion        is    in
this case easily seen to be nearly proportional                     to the tangent           of
half the angle of the oil prism.                   If   two kinds of glass, of very
different       dispersive powers,      but of nearly equal mean refractive
powers,       could be obtained,       a    permanent combination            might          be
easily formed on this plan, giving as much dispersion as a very
long train of ordinary          prisms, and losing scarcely any light.                      A
slight inclination of the ends to one another will enable us to use
ordinary flint and crown for the purpose,                   except in so far as total
reflection may interfere.          Such    a   combination, adjusted for the red

412                   Proceedings of the Royal Society
ray C, seems to promise to be of considerable use in observations of
the sun's atmosphere.            A somewhat similar result may          be obtained
by using a single          large prism, one      of   whose   faces,  employed for
total reflection, has a very slight cylindrical curvature.
2. On a Method         of illustrating   to a large Audience the Composition
         of simple Harmonic Motions under various conditions.
   I  have often felt the difficulty of illustrating, by means of Airy's
Wave Machine, and various other complex instruments of a similar
character, the composition of plane polarised rays into a single
elliptically   or  circularly polarised     one   ;  the difficulty arising chiefly
in showing separately, but in close succession,               to the audience the
two vibrations which           are to be compounded, and their            resultant.
Lissajoux's     apparatus would exactly answer the purpose                if we had
tuning-forks      vibrating 10 or 15 times a second, its sole defect being
the extreme rapidity with which differences of phase are run through                  ;
and, in fact,   I have tried metronome pendulums with              mirrors attached
to them    ;  but  I have     since found the following arrangement to be
much more satisfactory.             It consists simply in using plane mirrors
rotating about axes very nearly perpendicular to their surfaces.                   A
ray reflected almost normally from each of two such mirrors, equally
inclined     to their axes,       and rotating       in opposite directions     with
equal angular velocities, has communicated to                it a simple harmonic
vibration, whose        line and phase can be adjusted at pleasure             by   a
touch.      Two such systems of pairs of mirrors, connected by elastic
bands with an axle driven by hand, enable the operator to illustrate
every combination of two simple-harmonic                  motions, as well as of
circular and elliptic vibrations.            By     an obvious adjustment       it is
easy to use, instead         of  equal  periods of vibration, periods bearing
any desired      relation to one another       ; and    by crossing one or more
of the bands we reverse the direction of rotation in the correspond
ing shafts.      It  is absolutely necessary        to have   adjusting screws by
which to regulate the inclination           of each mirror to its axis.

of Physics       have  I found this so marked as in the most elementary
portions    of geometrical optics.           Such   a formula as

reciprocals of the distances of the object and image from the sur
face   of a concave spherical mirror, is equal to double the reciprocal
of the radius of the mirror,"           if understood at all, is understood as        a
sort of memoria        technica which enables          the student to make calcu
lations;     but unless      he  have      some   knowledge of mathematics           it
suggests     absolutely no higher           meaning.      If,  however, we give to
the various        terms of the formula their meanings in terms of the
divergence      of  the incident and reflected beams, and of the normals
to the    reflecting surface,     even the non-mathematical            student easily
understands the relation signified.               I  am indebted to      Mr Sang for
 a   reference to Lloyd On Light and Vision,                  1831,   in which     this
 mode                                                              I
         of presenting the subject is introduced, but think the term
 "vergency" there used is hardly so convenient as the more com
 monly employed word            divergence.        Our fundamental        optical fact
 is that to produce the most distinct vision rays must diverge as                     if
 from a point about ten inches from the eye.                   No  one has any diffi
 culty in understanding this.             As my object has been merely to men
 tion to the Society what            I  have   found to be a method (however
 trivial in itself, yet) of really considerable importance in teaching,
  I  need do no more than give one simple example                  of its application,
  and that only to direct pencils          of such small divergence that spheri
  cal aberration may be neglected.              A perfectly obvious       set of modi
  fications   is introduced when we treat of oblique pencils, and pencils
  of large divergence,        but students capable of understanding              these
  do   not require the adoption of such elementary                   methods of ex
  planation.
      Take, then, the case of light refracted at           a  concave spherical sur
  face,  bounding a substance denser than air.                  If the incident     and
  refracted     rays make (small) angles a and /? with the axis of the

                          sin  (y-a)   = ix sin  (y-ft,
or, approximately,
                              y-a   =  Li(y-P),

where fi is the refractive         index.     [This  we may,    if    we choose,
translate into
where y is the distance of the point        of incidence from the axis, and
the rest   of  the notation is as    usual. In this form we see that, to
our approximation, the result is independent of y.]
   In (1) we have y = 0 for a plane surface, and /i =         — 1    when     there
is reflection instead    of refraction.
   Hence for a reflecting surface the meaning of (1) is — " the sum
of the divergences of the incident and reflected rays is twice that
of  the   normals to the surface."         If  the incident rays be      parallel,
the reflected rays diverge twice as much as do the normals.
   At the    second surface    of a thin lens (1) becomes
                           J"- G->-
which, compounded with (1), gives
                           /9'-a   =  O-l)(y-y0,
which may be thus translated — "          A lens produces    a definite change
of divergence    on  any direct pencil — and the change is          /*
                                                                       — 1   times
the difference of the divergences of the normals to its surfaces."
   Hence that      a divergence may be changed into an equal negative
divergence,     it must   be equal to   half the change produced by the
lens;   i.e., when the     object and     image are equidistant        from the
lens, their common distance from it is double the focal length of
the lens.

         4.   On the Structure of the Palceozoic Crinoids.
                   By Professor Wyville Thomson.
                                          (Abstract.)
  The best known living representatives of the Echinoderm Class
Ckinoidka are the genera Antedon and Pentacrinus — the former the
feather stars, tolerably common in all seas                     ;    the latter the stalked
sea lilies,    whose    only         ascertained habitat, until lately, was the
deeper portion of the              sea of the      Antilles, whence they              were rarely
recovered by being accidentally entangled on fishing lines.                               Within
the last few years Mr Robert Damon, the well-known dealer in
natural history objects in Weymouth, has procured a considerable
number of specimens of the two West-indian Pentacrini,                                    and    Dr
Carpenter      and the author had an opportunity                               of making        very
detailed observations both on the hard and the soft parts.                                  These
observations will shortly be published.
   The Genera Antedon and Pentacrinus                         resemble one another in
all essential particulars of internal structure. The great distinc
tion between them       that while Antedon swims freely in the water,
                             is,
and anchors itself at will by means of                  a   set of   "dorsal cirri," Penta
crinus   is   attached to      a     jointed stem, which             is   either permanently
fixed to some foreign body, or, as in the case of                               a     fine species
procured off the coast of Portugal during                      the cruise of the Porcu
pine in the summer of 1870, loosely rooted by                             a   whorl of terminal
cirri in soft mud.           Setting      aside      the stalk, in Antedon and Penta
crinus the body consists of               a   rounded central disc and ten or more
              arms.                ciliated                                     the " oral

  "ventral" surface of the pinnules                    and arms, and these tributary
brachial      grooves gradually               coalescing,     terminate          in   five radial
grooves, which         end    in an oral opening, usually subcentral, some
times very excentric.               The   oesophagus, stomach, and intestine coil
round a central axis, formed                  of   dense connective tissue, apparently
continuous with the stroma of the ovary, and of involutions of the
perivisceral     membrane;             and the       intestine ends           in an anal tube,
which opens excentrically                 in one of the interradial                   spaces,    and
usually projects considerably above the surface of the disc.                                    The
contents of the stomach                are found       uniformly          to consist of    a    pulp

416                Proceedings        of the Royal Society
composed      of particles of organic matter, the shields of diatoms,
and   the shells of minute foraminifera.              The   mode    of nutrition
may be readily observed         in Antedon, which will live for months in
a tank.      The   animal rests      attached by its dorsal cirri, with its
arms expanded        like the petals of a full-blown         flower.   A current
of  sea- water, bearing organic particles, is carried by the          cilia along
the brachial grooves into the mouth, the water is exhausted in the
alimentary canal of its assimilable            matter, and is finally ejected
at the anal orifice.         The length and direction of the anal tube
prevents the exhausted water and the fcec.tl matter from returning
at once    into the ciliated passages.
    In the probably extinct family Cyathocrinidae,               and notably    in
the genus Cyathocrinus, which           I  take as the type of the Palaeozoic
group, the so called Crinoidea tesskllata, the arrangement, up to
a  certain point, is much the same.             There    is a widely-expanded
crown of branching arms, deeply grooved, which doubtless performed
the same functions         as the grooved arms of Pentacrinus ; but            the
grooves stop short at the edge of the disc, and there is no central
opening,     the only visible       apertures being a tube,       sometimes     of
extreme length,         rising   from   the   surface of the disc in one         of
the   interradial    spaces,   which    is   usually greatly enlarged for its
accommodation by the intercalation of additional perisomatic plates,
and a small     tunnel-like opening through           the  perisom   of the edge
of the disc opposite the base of each of the arms, in continuation
of the groove of the arm.            The functions of      these  openings, and
the   mode    of nutrition of the crinoid          having this structure, has
been the subject of much controversy.
    The author had lately had an opportunity of examining some
very remarkable specimens of Cyathocrinus arthriticus, procured by
Mr Charles Ketley from             the  upper Silurians     of Wenlock,     and a
number of wonderfully          perfect examples of species of the genera
 Actinocrinus, Platycrinus,       and others,   for which he was indebted to
 the liberality   of   Mi   Charles Wachsmuth        of Burlington,    Ohio, and
 Mr Sidney Lyon of Jeflfersonville, Indiana; and he had also had
 the advantage of studying photographs of plates, showing the
 internal structure of fossil crinoids, about to be published by Messrs
 Meek     and   Worlhen, State Geologists            for Illinois.     A careful
examination of all these, taken in connection with the description

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                            417
by Professor         Loven,     of Hyponome Sarsii, a recent crinoid             lately
procured from Torres Strait, had led him to the following general
conclusions.
      In accordance with the views of Dr Schultze, Dr Liitken,                      and
Messrs Meek          and   Worthen,       he regarded the proboscis of the tesse-
lated      crinoids     as the anal tube,         corresponding      in every   respect
with the anal tube in Antedon and Pentacrinus, and he maintained
the      opinion which          he     formerly     published     (Edin. New Phil.
Jour., Jany. 1861),              that the valvular "pyramid" of the Cysti-
 deans      is also the anus. The true mouth in the tesselated cri
 noids is an internal opening vaulted over by the plates of the peri-
 som, and situated           in the axis of the radial          system     more or less
 in     advance     of the anal         tube, in the position         assigned by    Mr
 Billings to his " ambulacral opening."                 Five,  ten, or more openings
 round the edge of the disc lead into channels continuous with the
 grooves on the ventral               surface of the arms,       either covered     over
 like the mouth by perisomatic plates, the inner surface of which
  they more or less           impress, and       supported beneath by chains of
  ossicles;     or,  in rare    cases   (A mphoracrinus), tunnelled in the sub
  stance     of the greatly thickened walls of the vault.               These internal
  passages,     usually reduced          in number to five by uniting with one
  another, pass into the internal               mouth, into which they doubtless
   lead the current from the ciliated brachial grooves.
       The connection of different             species   of Platyccras with various
  crinoids, over whose           anal openings      they fix themselves, moulding
   the edges of their          shells to the form of shell of the crinoid, is           a
   case of "commensalism,"                in which the mollusc takes advantage
   for nutrition and respiration of the current passing through                      the
   alimentary       canal of the echinoderm.             Hyponome Sarsii        appears,
    from    Professor     Loven    's  description,   to be a    t rue  crinoid, closely
   allied to Antedon, and does not seem in any way to resemble                       the
    Cystideans.        It  has, however,      precisely the same arrangement as
    to its  internal    radial vessels and mouth which we find in the older
    crinoids.     It  bears    the same structural relation to Antedon which
    Extracrinus bears to Pentacrinus.
        Some examples of different tesselated             crinoids from the Burling
    ton   limestone,      most    of   them    procured    by  Mr Wachsmuth,         and
    described    by Messrs Meek            and Worthen,      show a very remarkable

418                  Proceedings of the Royal Society
convoluted plate, somewhat in form like the shell of a Scaphander,
placed vertically      in the centre of the cup, in the position occupied
hy the fibrous axis or columella          in Pentucrinus and Aniedan.           Mr
Billings, the distinguished palaeontologist           to the Survey    of Canada.
in  a very valuable paper on the structure of the Crinoidea, Cystitlea,
and   Blastoidea (Silliman's Jcurnal, January 1870), advocates the
view that the plate is connected with the apparatus of respiration,
and that it is homologous with the pectinated rhombs               of Cystideans,
the tube apparatus of Pentremites,            and the    sand-canal of Asterids.
Messrs Meek and Worthen              and Dr Liitken, on the other hand,
regard   it  as associated    in some way with       the alimentary canal and
the function of nutrition.
   The author strongly supported           the   latter opinion.     The perivis
ceral membrane in Antedon and                Pentacrinus     already alluded     to,
which lines the whole calyx,            and    whose    involutions,   supporting
the coils of the       alimentary canal, contribute         to the   formation of
the central columella,         is crowded with miliary         grains and small
plates   of carbonate of lime;       and a very      slight modification would
convert     the   whole into a delicate         fenestrated calcareous       plate.
Some     of the specimens in        Mr Wachsmuth's collection show              the
open    reticulated     tissue   of the central coil continuous          over the
whole of the interior of the calyx, and rising on the walls                 of  the
vault, thus following almost exactly the course of the perivisceral
membrane in the recent forms.                In all likelihood, therefore,      the
internal    calcareous network in the crinoids,             whether rising into
a  convoluted      plate or lining     the cavity of the crinoid          head,   is
simply    a  calcified condition of the perivisceral sac.
    The author was inclined to agree with             Mr Rofe    and  Mr Billings
in attributing      the functions of respiration to the pectinated rhombs
of the Cystideans and the tube apparatus of the Blastoids.                 He   did
 not see, however, that          any equivalent       arrangement      was  either
necessary     or probable in the crinoids with expanded arms, in which
the provisions for respiration, in the form            of tubular tentacles    and
 respiratory films and lobes over the whole extent of the arms and
 pinnules, are so elaborate       and complete.

5.  On the Formation and Decomposition of some Chlorinated
                         Acids.      By      J. Y.    Buchanan.
    1.   On  the Rate of the Action         of a Large Excess of Water on Mono-
chloracetic Acid at 100°         C. — When monochloracetic acid is heated
with water, double decomposition takes place, glycollic and hydro
chloric acids being formed           ;   and conversely, when glycollic acid is
heated     with hydrochloric acid, it            is converted into      monochloracetic
acid and water.          A similar reaction takes place with the two mono-
chloropropionic        and corresponding            lactic acids, and probably with
all  their homologues.
    The task which        I  have set myself is to study these reactions, in
so  far as they are dependent upon temperature, duration of reaction,
and    relative  mass of reacting substances.                 In the present commu
nication,     I give   the results of experimenting              upon monochloracetic
acid     with   a very     large, practically          infinite,   excess   of water    at
100° C.
    The monochloracetic           acid was purchased from               Dr Marquart, of
Bonn, and rectified.            What        passed     between 180° and 190° was
used    for the following experiments : — A watery solution of it                     was
made     which contained in        a   litre    32-4 grms., and       showed    a specific
gravity = 1-0124, whence the chloracetic                     acid and the water were
mixed in the proportion of one                     molecule of the former to 164
molecules of the latter.
    As the increase of the acidity of the solution is the measure of
 the decomposition          which takes place, it is easily determined by
 titration.     For this purpose          a   solution of caustic soda was gene
 rally employed, although in the earliest experiments                       baryta water
 was    made use of.*         The saturating power of               these  reagents was
    * Berthelot
                 (Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. [3], lxv., 401) made use only
 of  baryta, his objections to potash and soda being that they always contain
 carbonate, and that their salts with organic acids always have a more or less
 alkaline reaction.     The first of these objections may be got rid of by keeping
 the solution, freed from CO, in the first instance by lime water, in a number
 of small bottles filled full up to their tightly fitting corks.        The second I have
  found not to apply to the bodies here in question.             There is no doubt, how
  ever, that baryta solution does present considerable advantages in the greater
  ease  with which it can be procured          in a state of absolute    purity ; and that
  any carbonic acid which it may absorb is at once eliminated, thereby, how

420                 Proceedings      of the. Royal Society
ascertained by means of        a very carefully prepared normal sulphuric
acid, containing      49 grins.   H,SO, in      a litre.    10CC. of this acid
saturated 42 7 CC. caustic soda, and           418 CC. baryta water, whence
one litre caustic soda       contains 9-3677 grms. NaHO, and one litre
baryta water 20 450 grms. BaH.,O,.             10 CC. of the above-mentioned
chloracetic acid saturated 14        7  CC. caustic soda and 14 4 CC. baryta
water.
   In every experiment        10 CC. chloracetic acid solution were sealed
up in   a tube,   and   introduced directly into the boiling water bath.
After    the  reaction was finished, it was transferred immediately             to
a vessel   of cold water.      By this     means    the time of heating     up to
100° and     of cooling     down  again to the surrounding          temperature
was reduced      to a minimum.
    The chloracetic acid solution was prepared            in the middle of last
November, and although it has now stood at the ordinary tempe
rature of the laboratory for over four months, its saturating power
has not changed to a sensible extent.              It is true, however, that it
gives a slight opalescence          with solution of nitrate of silver.         It
appears then that the decomposition of monochloracetic acid by a
large excess of water at the ordinary temperature is infinitely slow.
    In the experiments at 100J C. the same quantity, namely, 10 CC.
of the acid solution,        was invariably     employed.      In the following
table showing       the results, the first column        contains the duration
of the experiment in hours         ;  the second the number of CC. caustic
soda   or baryta water       required to saturate the resulting         acid, and
the third      gives   the   percentage chloracetic        acid decomposed      as
calculated from column 2.             No fraction smaller than      0 5 is given,
this being the limit of possible errors of observation           : —
ever, altering the strength of the solution.      My principal objection to it was
its great tendency to crystallise     even  in solutions a long way removed from
 saturation.

    Tracey, R.A.         Communicated by St John Vincent Day,
    Esq., C.E., F.R.S.E.
   In considering     the authority for the division of the sacred            cuhit
into 25 inches, we         have,  first,   the  architectural      fact  that the
Queen's     chamber,    containing    the visible expression of that cubit,
stands in or upon the 25th course of masonry, comprising the whole
Pyramid.       And   here, though not strictly bearing on the case, may
be   mentioned a connection between             the lengths of the two pas
sages (the first ascending, and        the horizontal passages) leading to
that chamber,     remarkable when         expressed    in   inches, of which 25
make a cubit.
   Thus, the length of the first ascending passage from the axis of
descending passage to north wall of Grand Gallery (see p. 54,
v. ii., L. and W.)* = 1544 4 B. I., or 1542 9 inches, of which 25
make a sacred or Pyramid cubit, and which for the future we will
term    "Pyramid inches."
   Now, this length of 1542-         9   P. I.— 25    = 1517 9      P. I. — is the
exact length of the horizontal            passage    from north wall of the
Grand Gallery to the north wall of the Queen's Chamber —

    But on entering the Antechamber, we find this particular mea-
          sacred cubit
sure or                   (which    we     have  termed the     Pyramid inch.
                25
to avoid expressing        that   particular     measure    of length    by the
algebraical    x) not only typified, but expressed, and most notably
in the granite leaf, whose precise functions have never yet been
explained.
    For  there  — on  a stone  immediately in front of an unmistakable
symbol of division into five — we find a raised boss, with a single
straight    edge   exactly  £  of  a   Pyramid or     sacred  cubit  in length,
and consequently representing          5  of these inches.
    The thickness of this      boss along the whole line of 5 inches is
exactly £ of that line,     ^   of the     same cubit, or precisely the inch
we are   in  search of.
    Further,   the centre of this boss is exactly one inch from the
 middle of the Antechamber,          its distance from either side being
 19-5 and    21'5 inches from the west and east walls respectively,
and, consequently, it is one inch to the west of centre (just as the
 niche in the Queen's Chamber, marking              the whole 25 inch cubit
 by the breadth of its flat top, is also 25 inches removed from the
central vertical line of the wall in which it is formed).
    It may be argued that all these expressions of an inch in the
 Antechamber      depend   upon the shape and position of          a stone  that
 was not necessarily placed there by the architect           of the Pyramid.
    Let  us, therefore, seek     some     connection with the grander fea
 tures  of the building, both for the stone itself and the particular
 measure of length, of which we are thus far led to consider it the
 standard.
    The following calculation shows that a line drawn from                    the
 angle of the great step at an angle of 26° 18', or parallel to               the
 true axis of the Grand Gallery,         passes   about 1'13 inch below the
 centre  of  the bottom of the upper stone forming the granite leaf,
 or the one that bears the boss.

and find that the height of the granite wainscot there,                                 where it
bears against the          south wall, is 1118 inches or T62 B.                         I. lower
than the spot indicated.                                         axis*
                                      But, on examining the course of the
itself of the Grand Gallery when produced, the following calculation
shows that it passes through the lower stone of the leaf at a distance
of 0-8 inch below its centre on its northern side, and on being pro
duced       strikes the south wall of the Antechamber at a height above
the floor      of   104 02 B.       I.,   or   just   an inch above the height              of the
wainscot on the east side, which reaches an altitude of 1031 B.                                I.
  Thus connecting the inch, the granite leaf, and the rest of the
building in  manner that none but the original Designer could

    The Ark, or Laver by theory, and the Pyramid Coffer in prac
tice, contain 71321 25 B. I. = 71,250 P. L, the quarter of which,
or 17812 5 Pyramid inches (the volume of this particular                 stone),
is the Chomer or Homer of sacred standard.
    The remarkable result thus obtained induces a further examina
tion of the position of this stone.
    We remark that      the   base of this stone (lower stone) is in the
same horizontal plane      as  three other well defined lines of the       ante
chamber — viz., the division         between   the courses   of  the wainscot
on the east wall, and the       tops  of the  doors in the north and south
walls.
    It is to be noticed that the refined workmanship of the granite
wainscoting     has been    most fully developed       to the south      of the
 leaf.
    We will thus examine that portion first.         The granite leaf       itself
and the granite walls mark off above the horizontal              plane    a cer
tain space.

    The already acquired facts give            us good reason to look upon the
25th part of the sacred cubit as an unit of measure that may be
safely used in at least the antechamber of the great Pyramid,                   and
we only argue in conformity             with other teaching of the Pyramid
in assuming that the volume of the lower stone of the leaf may
also be an unit of volume for antechamber cubical measures.
     Thus  if we take      the lowest readings,        a  cubical space of 27-5   x
41-2    x 79-0   B.I., or (1.) 89507-0 B.I. is marked out; or (2.)           5-019

428                Proceedings        of t/ie Royal Society
king's chamber has been found the coffer in one 50 times its own
content.    The   rest   of the granite-lined     chamber, of which the above
formed part, may also be worthy of consideration.                Its length   and
breadth are the same as that of the portion already considered,
while its height is determined by that of the containing wainscots.
But these, as we have already seen, are determined by the heights
at which the south wall is touched, the one by the axis of the (first
ascending passage produced through the) Grand Gallery prolonged
into the antechamber, and the other by                a   line parallel   thereto
drawn    from    the angle of the great step.              But  as  it would    be
evidently giving either undue weight to use it alone, let us take
(as the following       calculation shows) the average height of the two

   Granting     that, we have another noteworthy              connection estab
lished between the antechamber and king's chamber, as there the
volume of the lower course has been shown (by Professor Smyth)
to equal 50 coffers, or 200        of our units, while   here we have its tenth
part, or 20 units equalling 5 coffers.
   It will  doubtless be objected that in one instance we have               used
the highest, and        the  other the lowest readings of the measures.
Just proportion       teaches    that the product of the means         should   be
of no less value than that of the extremes.
   Let  us then take the means of those two sets of numbers, whose
extremes only we have been using heretofore, and employ them                    in

                   fds, and the three stones of the ceiling and the
three cuts on the wainscot seem to point to some important divi

pression as regards it, when expressed                        in say the same terms of

    Taking it            as represented by 314"159,             &c. Pyramid inches, we
find diameter             +    radius expressed very closely, as          §   and        ^   of the
height of the antechamber (i.e., 149-2").
  But when we divide ir itself (still expressed in                       terms      of   R   = 100
Pyramid inches) by                3,   we obtain the figures 104- 72, which                  strike
us as being an approximation                    to the height     of the wainscot            on the
east wall (103-1);
                 but when we refer to the grand gallery axis (to
whose connection with the east wainscot our attention has already
been drawn) we find               a    still closer approximation (viz.,         104 06        P.1.J

bears on the case, as             it   is   in the calculation      of volume of spheres,

terms     of   ir.
    It   may be advantageous to note here the connection between the
volumes of pyramids and spheres.                           The content of       a   pyramid       is
mathematically expressed                    thus.

So that in the case of the great hemispherical                                                molten sea, whose
content = 50 lavers,                      a   pyramid of the same base and height would
contain 25 lavers, 100 homers,                                  or five            of the largest marked-off

     This may certainly                        lead   us     to    infer, that as up to the ante
chamber our measures have been lineal and superficial; now, on
the other hand, we must be prepared for cubical measures with,
perhaps, also some concerning                                the      content of spheres,                    cones,     or

     But    we are getting on too fast.               Now in spite of the presence of
  »r  are    we to suppose          the circle squared           practically,  as   we have
  imagined, when suggesting that the area of the base of a square
 pyramid might be represented                   by 7rR2    ?
     To seek an answer to that question                  we    must go back to that part
 of our investigation, where we had reason to believe that the                           con
  nection     between        116-3     and   365-24      was intentionally       introduced
 as an    exponent of the relation between diameter and circumference,
 and we may not unreasonably test the accuracy of our deductions
 by finding        the area of the circle there expressed,                 trusting   that   if
 we are working in the right                 direction this step may lead to            some
 further proof of its being so.
     But in     so  doing we should use the figures only                 as a  guide to   the
 intentions     of the Great Architect,             and having as we believe learnt
              "
 that the        year" of inches           symbolises a circle of 365 256, &c., we

     To proceed.
     The area of       a  circle whose diameter is             116- 264 is 10,616-65.
     This number in itself              does not seem peculiarly suggestive, but
 when      we recollect how remarkably                   both the east wainscot and
granite floor* point to an accurately marked square of 103
                                                                                    Pyramid

inches       whose area      =    10,609, we    think   we have advanced          in the
right direction          and shown that the builder here                places   for our
instruction         and guidance        another    practical     illustration    of   the
importance and use of ir, its former application                     being lineal, and
this superficial.         And     here we stay to point out how these            curious
proportions, coincidences, and symbols become                       legible when read
by the      units of length       and volume supplied by the architect             of the
pyramid        himself, and extant (let us hope) to this day in the very
spot where their use first becomes imperative.
    For though         the proportions      remain the same whether expressed
 in   inches, feet, or metres, they only become vocal as it were when
 read by      the units there prepared and hung up near them.
     What       should     be   the   next   step   in   the   process     of inductive
 argument ?
     The sides and perimeter of this square                  (of    103-0  P.I.)   are so
 obviously       connected with the length             and breadth of the King's
  Chamber,        as exactly     \, and   J thereof, that a consideration          of the
  area    of its floor would perhaps be the next step, guided too by the
  admonition        we   fancy we have         received on passing through the
  antechamber,         that    cubical   and not simply         linear or superficial
  measures should occupy us in the chamber ultimately                      attained.
     With what results this            has been done over the area of that floor,
  we   already know, from Taylor, Smyth, Petrie, and Day, results too
  so   overwhelmingly         important, that though the tables of the Law,
  written     by the hand of the Omniscient, have been lost to man, we
  have here       inscribed by the great architect of the pyramid the very
  essence      of   all legislation,     so   exact and so scientific         in all its
  branches, as far as we can penetrate,              that it is indeed " ennobling
  to the     mind of man to contemplate."

       This communication was chiefly directed to the question whether
   the    idea  of distance     be obtained from the adjustment of the eyes
   to  distinct vision, or from the convergence of their axes.                  The case
   of the chameleon was              cited as one      in point, since that lizard

directs its eyes       each     to a separate       object, but habitually,             when
about to strike its prey, brings both eyes to bear upon it.                          Several
experiments,        mostly     suggested      by AVheatsone's inquiries,                 were
cited, and the conclusion was arrived at, that, although the adjust
ment for direct vision concur in the formation of the estimate                                  ot
distance, the convergence of the eyes plays the principal part.
 3.    On the Fall of Rain at Carlisle and the neighbourhood.
                    By Thomas Barnes, M.D.
      In this communication, the author                  offers    remarks on journals
kept by Dr Carlyle,            in the    city of Carlisle,             from 1757 to 17S3
inclusive;        by the Rev. Joseph Guiding, at Aikbank, near Wigton,
Cumberland, from 1792 to 1810 inclusive;                     and by himself at Bun
kers    Hill, two     and a half miles west of Carlisle, which is situate
184 feet above       the sea-level. The author gave tables showing the
quantity of rain of each month and year included in these periods.
From the averages,        it   appears      that about twice as much rain                  fall>
in each of the latter months of the table as in the month of April                                ;
and     about one-third         less rain    falls in the first six months of               tho
year than in the last six months, and that April is the driest mouth
of the year.

                        1. On a Quaternion          Integration.
      A problem      proposed      to me lately by my friend                 T. Steverwn,
H.E.,    for constructing          what he calls     a     Differential       Mirror,   when
attacked directly led to the equation
where a is a unit-vector, perpendicular to                  /?.
      By another mode of solution           it   was easy to see          that the intejrr.il
must be of the form
                        To     -   T(/3 + aVap)      =    constant.
It     may   be   instructive to consider this question somewhat                     closely,
as the    form of the unintegrated expression                     is   certainly (to say    the
least) at first sight unpromising.

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                                                         435
    The problem was               :   to coustruct        a reflecting               surface from which
rays, emitted from a point, shall after reflection diverge uniformly,
hut horizontally.            Using the ordinary property of                                a reflecting sur
face, we easily obtain the first written                            equation.               By Hamilton's
grand
           " Theory of Systems of Rays,"                        we at once write down                            the
second.
    The connection between them is easily shown thus.                                              Let      =.   and
t   be any two vectors whose tensors are equal.                                  then
                                           = 1     +   2-T-'        +
                           (i±-~y
                                           =   2»t-,(l          +    S^T-'),
whence,        to a scalar factor pris, we have
                                          (#-'*-'•
Hence,   putting v = U(/3 + aVap) and                            t   = Up, we have                   from        the
first equation above
                            S.</p[Up        + U(y3 +           oVap)] = 0.
But
                      d(/3 + aVap) = aVa«/p =                    —               —
                                                                     dp              aSarfp    ,
and
                                       S . a(/3 + aVap) = 0                  ,
to that we have finally
                  S   .   dfpUp   -S     . tZfjS   + oVap)U(/3 + aVap)                       = 0 ,
which is the differential of the second equation above.                                              A curious
particular        case      is a parabolic             cylinder,            as       may be easily seen
geometrically.              The general surface has                     a   parabolic section in the
plane of        a, /3;    and a hyperbolic section in the plane of                                 /?,   a/3.
     It   is   easy to see that this           is   but   a    single case of              a   large class of
integrable scalar functions, whose general type                                       is
the equation of the reflecting surface;                          while
                                          S(o~     -   p)d<r    =    0
is the equation of the surface of the reflected                                       wave: the integral

     The following results               were obtained lately while                 I   was consider

elementary that it is not likely that they can be new, but as they
are novel to myself, and to several                             mathematicians whom                I    have
consulted,     I bring them              before        the Society : —

teans     and Annelids found in this expedition, and of certain in
teresting questions in zoology connected therewith.
    Amongst      the Nemerteans is the curious Ommatoplea spectabilis           of
De Quatrefages,        a species   of much interest, in so far as its discoverer
stated     that it    was furnished       with   a peculiar   horny   pectinated
structure in its proboscis.            Careful examination showed       that the
latter has a strictly Ommatoplean anatomy, the longitudinal                 bands
of the reticulated layer of the pinkish organ being very apparent.
In Prosorhochmus claparedii, Keferstein, the granules of the exter
nal    circlet of glands round the stylet-region of the proboscis are
unusually large and distinct.            The granular basal sac of the central
stylet is of a peculiar shape, having a straight border and sharp
angles posteriorly,         and    obtuse    angles at   the   sides  anteriorly.
The pale setting of this apparatus is comparatively limited in bulk ;
 and the curved fibres of the region behind the latter pass out
 wards     and forwards in a very distinct manner.            The development
 of the ova in      the bodies of the females of this viviparous species is
 very    similar to that of      the free ova and their      products in other
 Ommatopleans, space being formed for the growing embryos by the
 enormous dilatation of the ovisacs.           Indeed, the larger young speci
 mens,      which are often doubled within the body of the parent,
 appear to be in cavities produced by the coalescing           of many   ovisacs  ;
 at any rate,     it is clear that to describe    them, as former authors have
  done,    as simply     within the body-cavity of        the worm, is wanting
  in structural accuracy.         It  seems to be a further stage of the type
  of    development        observed     in   Nemertes  carcinophilus,   Kolliker
  (Polia involuta, Van Beneden), in which, after the deposition of
  the majority, a few are left in the body of the parent for subse
  quent     evolution.      A still more remarkable Nemertean is the
  Borlasia elisabethce, M'L, from Herm, a large species with a
  pointed, eyeless snout.         In this form the powerful muscular layers
  of the body-wall         are tinted    of a fine reddish hue, so that the
  resemblance      in this respect to the muscles of the higher animals is
   striking.    The proboscis is extremely slender in proportion to the
   bulk of the animal, and its muscular walls are comparatively thin.
   A reddish coloration       was frequently observed      in the living animal
   at the   white belts, showing that some contained fluid tinted the

   440                Proceedings      of the Royal Society
  cutaneous tissues       during its passage.      On puncturing       the swollen
   anterior end, a copious exudation of a reddish-brown fluid occurred.
   This  presented      many fusiform       and clavate corpuscles, probably
  from the proboscidian fluid        ;  but there were also a vast number           of
  minute granules, of a yellowish colour by transmitted light, though
  reddish in mass,        which    doubtless belonged to the blood-proper.
  Many of the latter       bodies showed      a contraction    in the middle, so
  as to resemble     the outline of a figure of eight.
     In  regard to the Annelids Proper, it is found that the northern
  Aphrodita aculeata and Lcetmonice filicornis,          Kbg.,    are replaced    by
  the southern Hermione hystrix, which occurs             in great abundance in
  water from 10 to 20 fathoms in depth.              Amongst       the Polynoidce,
  P.  areolata,   Grube, is remarkable in having greatly swollen               cirri.
  The dorsal bristles are not very robust, while the ventral are in
  two sets,   if the ends alone are viewed, but form a regularly              dimi
  nishing    series   from the dorsal to the ventral surface as regards
  length of tip.        The  scales   are boldly   areolated.     In this species
 there is a series of well-marked circular muscular fibres towards the
 outer half of the vertical coat           of the proboscis.       The new     Har-
  motho'e marphysce      accompanies Marphysa sanguinea in its tube.
     The remarkable forms of the Phyllodocidce and Hesionidce ; the
 great abundance of the Nereidce, and the uses of the latter as bait,
  were next detailed.
     The representatives of       the Eunicidae are very plentiful.         Besides
 the gigantic       Marphysa       sanguinea,   there   occur Marphysa         belli,
 Eunice harassii or norvegica. and Eunice gallica.               The allied forms
 Lysidice     ninetta and Blainvillea filum are also abundant, and
 impart    a character to the fauna of the region. The same may be
 said  of Prionognalhus Kefersteini and         Staurocephalus      rubrovittatus.
     Chcetopterus norvegicus     and other phosphorescent Annelida were
then examined, and the facts observed in these,               as  well as  in other
luminous invertebrates were shown to give no support to the Abyssal

 2.   Note. On the Use of the Scholastic Terms Vetus Logica
       and Nova Logica, with a Remark upon the corresponding
       Terms Antiqui and Moderni. By Thomas M. Lindsay,
       M.A., Examiner in Philosophy                to the      University of Edin
       burgh.
     During the earlier part of the middle              ages, or     until  the middle
 of the eleventh century, students of logic had a very incomplete
knowledge of the logical works of Aristotle.                   They knew the trans
lations which Boethius had made of Porphyry's                     Ei"eraytuyij, of Aris
 totle's irtpl  KareyopLtov,   and  of his irepl epp.r1vtia's,  and they knew       little
 else.    Their labours did not         go beyond the reproduction of, and
 commenting on, these old Greek writings.
     Towards      the  beginning     of the twelfth         century,     however,      the
 gradual diffusion of knowledge had brought with it acquaintance
 with the remaining treatises of Aristotle's Organon.                   The old trans
 lations of Boethius were recovered, and new translations were made.
 We     are told that
                           " Jacobus Clericus of Venetia translated from
 Greek into Latin certain books of Aristotle,                    and   commented        on
 them, namely,         the   Topica,   the    Analytics Prior and Posterior,
 and the Elenchi,       although," adds      the chronicler, "an earlier trans
 lation of these same books may be had."*                      This  was in 1128 a.d.
 It   is more    than probable that Roscellinus, who flourished 1080-
 1100,     knew more       of Aristotle's     writings     than     the   treatises     on
 the Categories and on Interpretation.              Abelard (b. 1079 — d. 1142)
 must have known the greater part of Aristotle's Organon, and John
of Salisbury (who died 1180), we know, knew the whole of it.
     Hence, whereas at the middle of the eleventh century the know
ledge    of Aristotle    was confined to acquaintance with the two first
    * " Jacobus Clericus de Venetia transtulit de grsoco in latinum quoadam
libroa Aristotelis etcommentatua est, scilicet Topica, Anal, priores et posteriorea
et Elenchos, quamvia        antiquior translatis super eosdem libroa haberetur."

Quoted from Prantl, Geschichte der Logik ii. p. 99.

442                 Proceedings        of the Royal Society
books of the Organon, along            with the Introduction           of Porphyry,
at the middle of the twelfth century there were two distinct sources
of knowledge of Aristotle's           opinions on Logic — that derived from
the    "old" tradition from         the books on the Categories, and on           In
terpretation,and from the Introduction of Porphyry, and that
derived from a " new tradition from recovered translations made
                    "
by Boethius of the Prior and Posterior Analytics,                of the Topics and
of   the book on Fallacies,        and from new translations.
     This new tradition      was looked upon with          considerable mistrust
by several of the steady going old schoolmen.                    It   disturbed their
view of logic.      They   had constructed a very fair well-rounded system
from the material supplied by the old tradition.                 It   had been suffi
cient for them then,         and    they wanted nothing new now.                Even
supposing that these new treatises were Aristotle's, they would not
admit them to bo logical, or,          if they went      so far, they would not
allow them to have any real importance.                  The old doctrine         had
done very well for them and their fathers before them, and                  it might
serve every one else.      They     saw no need for any change. On the other
hand, more enterprising students were vastly taken with these new
treatises, and found that they contained Aristotle's real logic.                They
revealed   to them the doctrine of the syllogism, and its application
in demonstrative, probable,           and    fallacious material of knowledge.
The new tradition was Logic, the old not more than an introduction,
even    if worthy of   that place.
     When we consider that logic, with all its verbal niceties, was
more studied than anything else in these days, we fiud in the very
fact of these two different traditions, and the two ways of accepting
them, all the elements for            a severe and    widely extended        quarrel   :
and the quarrel soon         arose.     On    the one side, the zeal shown in
studying    and     commenting        upon these     new   treatises was wholly
attributed to the love of novelty, and the new opinions concerning
logic and its sphere, which were coming into fashion, were set down
as due to a restless, shallow, modern spirit.              The logic of the new
tradition was called the "Nova Logica,"                 and those who advocated
it,   " Moderni."      On the other hand, the Moderni                   thought that
their opponents       were    prejudiced      against    their    opinions, simply
because they were not the old ones, and they despised                    them   as old
world thinkers, who had not the breadth of view required to accept

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                               443
anything, however         good   in itself, which differed from their old
theories.      They called the logic of the old tradition             the   "   Vetus
                                   "
Logica," and its upholders           Antiqui."
     Now, curiously enough these terms had             been applied     half  a cen
tury before, and in     a very different manner.         When Roscellinus had
startled the orthodox world by saying               that universals were only
"
   flatus vocis," and had drawn many heretical conclusions in logic
and    in theology, from this doctrine, his opponents said that he was
       author of      " new " kind of                               his
the                a                        logic, and called             followers
" moderni."       The "old " logic, of the days of Roscellinus, treated
logic from a realist point of view, the
                                                   " new " logic treated logic
                                                                               " and
from a nominalist      point   of view   (so   far as the words " realist
"nominalist"       can be used       with accuracy of any doctrine at this
early period of scholasticism).           The Antiqui of the time of Ros-
cellinus became realists in the time of Thomas of Aquino, and
the    " moderni "   were the nominalists        of later  days.
     Here then we have      a  confusion in the terminology, on the one
 hand    Vetus Logica meant the introduction of Porphyry, the trea
 tises on the Categories, and on Interpretation            ; Nova Logica,         the
 Prior and Posterior Analytics, the Topics and the book on Falla
 cies ; Antiqui, those who thought that Logic Proper was contained
 in this Vetus Logica; Moderni, those who thought that this Nova
 Logica     was the true Logic.         On the other hand, Vetus Logica
 meant    logic treated from       a realist point     of view   ; Nova Logica,
 logic treated from a nominalist          point of view;     while Antiqui and
 Moderni     corresponded very much to the latter terms of Realist
 and   Nominalist.
     This confusion    does not really       last throughout       the period      of
 Scholasticism.      The meaning of the terms did fluctuate             somewhat,
 as  all terms do, but upon the whole they preserved                 a great     uni
 formity     of meaning.       " Vetus " and " Nova           Logica,"      became
 dissociated    from    "Antiqui"        and "Moderni,"        with which they
 were at first so closely united,          and,   curiously   enough, while the
  one set  of terms kept   to one    of their primitive meanings, the other
  set kept to the opposite meaning.           " Vetus " and " Nova Logica "
  were used of divisions of Aristotle's Organon ; while Antiqui and
  Moderni became      more or less,     though never quite, equivalent to
  Realist and Nominalist.

444                  Proceedings       of the Royal Society
    " Vetus Logica," from the middle of the twelfth down to the
beginning of the sixteenth century, meant the logic taught in the
turaywyrf of       Porphyry,      and in the irtpl Karqyopunv and the             »rept
ipfir1vtias   of Aristotle.
    " Nova Logica,"                         same period, meant         the logic     of
                            during    the
Aristotle's      avaXwiKa.      wportpa,   avaXvruta    vortpa,    Tonucd  and    irtpi
o-otpioTiKwv    eXcyxui'.     This is the almost invariable scholastic use of
the terms.        Any other is accidental        and variable.
    Now, this assertion is made against the greatest authority                       in
the history of scholastic Logic, Professor Prantl of Munich, whose
" Geschichte der Logik im Abendlande,"                 is one  of the     most  trust
worthy      and    laborious efforts in historical         research.      Dr Prantl
recognises, as every one must do, that the meaning given here to
"vetus" and "nova logica"                was   one  of the principal scholastic
uses of the terms,        and every quotation to be made               from logical
treatises in support of our view of the question appears                       in his
notes, but he seems           to  think that the expressions retained their
relation to the names            " Antiqui " and " Moderni," and that
                                                                                  any
signification      which     belongs to them apart from these names is
entirely subordinate.            He connects the term " Nova Logica " with
the partly       grammatical,       partly   logical additions to the       doctrine
which first became          popular     through    the   Summulae      Logicales     of
                          *
Petrus Hispanus        ;      he makes it occupy the middle place           between
the " old
              "         and the
                                    " Ars Magna " of Raymond Sully; and
                 logic
he has    proved by a quotation from a dialogue in that curious and
amusing Manuale Scholarium               or Mediaeval Students' Guide-book,
given in Zarnacke's Deutschen TJniversitiiten                im Mittelalter,      that
when the Antiqui were hard pressed by the Moderni, they always
retired on the " Vetus Logica as their stronghold,

served the same invariable meanings in every writer during                 a period
of three centuries.            We may, therefore, admit, without prejudice
to   our statement, that the terms " Vetus '•'and " Nova Logica " did
bear those significations           which Prautl gives to them, and did pre
serve     a    more or less continuous connection with the terms
"               " and " Moderni."          But it may be proved that, from
    Antiqui
about the middle of the twelfth century down to the middle of the
fifteenth at least, the first meaning which the term Vetus Logica
would suggest to           a mediaeval   student was " the logic treated in the
Predicables         of Porphyry, and in the Categories and De Interpre-
                               "
tatione of Aristotle ;            while the first meaning suggested by the
term Nova Logica, was " the logic treated in Aristotle's Prior and
Posterior Analytics, his Topics, and his book on Fallacies."
     This may        be directly    proved from the quotations which Prantl

   In   the 14th century we have commentaries Super Veterem                                       Artem,
    by Antonius Andreas, by Walter Burleigh, and by Gratiadei
e.g.,
of Ascoli (Esculanus, as he is commonly called), and these are in
variably expositions of the Predicables of Porphyry, the Categorit- s.
and the De Interpretatione                   of Aristotle.
  Esculanus (d. 1341) says plainly, " Ars autem nova, qu« tota
versatur circa ratiocinationem, oportet quod distinguatur secundum
diversam cousiderationem                     eitts   ;    potest autem             ratiocinatio       dupli-

    There     is,   however,         another source of evidence which Prautl has
not in this reference carefully investigated                                — the regulations            and
decrees of the universities.                   When any term whatever                      is   found    ina
university decree,             we may take           it    for granted that its signification
there was the standard one for the time being, and when we find
the same terms occurring                      in the regulations                   of almost all         the
principal universities with the same meaning, we are warranted                                             in
adopting that meaning as the real signification of the term.
  These terms, " Vetus
                       "
                         and " Nova Logica," are frequently found
in the regulations of the mediaeval                             universities, and they invari
ably mean the logic taught in the first two, and the logic taught                                          in
the last four, of the treatises of the Organon.

       Thus     as  early as 1215 * the students of Paris University are
commanded            to read      the   books     of   Aristotle   on Logic,   — both     the
"    Vetus
               " and    the   "Nova Logica."
      In    1309    we find, among the               Statuta Collegii Cluniacensis,          a
statute concerning scholars studying philosophy, in which students
are told to work             at — first the Summulae          in the college; then the
Vetus Logica           ;  and    lastly the Nova Logica, either in the college
or outside. f          This     passage is important, because           it shows that the
Summulae are not part of the Nova Logica; elsewhere                            Summulists
are distinguished from Logicos.
      In    1366, at the reformation            of the Faculty of Arts, it is ordained
that students attending lectures in this faculty                      read   the whole of
 the vetus ars, four books of the Topics and                          the   books   of    the
 Eleuchi, the Prior or the Posterior Analytics completely,                         and the
 1 looks De Anima in whole or in part.]:
      In the munimenta of             the   University of Oxford, published by            the
 Master        of the Rolls,       we have        many references to the vetus and
 nova logica;         and in all cases the reference            is evidently to books of
 Aristotle's Organon.§
                                                                                 "           "
      Thus Artistae        are told, in 1340, that, before           they can      incept
 in arts, they must first have sworn that they have read two logical
 books       at   least,    one    of the      vetus   logica, and     the other of the
 nova.||

     Tbis reference       is important, because       it places    those grammatico-

                                       "
the moderni, outside of the nova logica."
     In the Liber Decanorum of the University of Prague, the Vetut
ars Aristotelis is always kept separate from the books of the Prior
and     Posterior Analytics, the Topics, and the book on Fallacies                    ;  f
                                                                                  " and
and this division is elsewhere             referred to    as  that of " Vetus
" Nova
             Logica."    J
     Aschbach, in his history of the University of Vienna, says that
the Ars Vetus treated of the Predicables of Porphyry, and of the
Categories        or    Predicaments,      and of the        de   Interpretatione       of
 Aristotle.       The Logica Nova looked at argumentation                   as a  whole,
aud considered —(1.) The Resolution or analyses of syllogisms given
in the Prior and Posterior             Analytics   ;   (2.) Inventive, or ways of
discovering true middle terms, given in the Topics; and (3.)
Fallacies, given in the libri Elenchorum.                     Prof. Aschbach shows
that Logic, as taught             in Vienna, consisted of three parts — the
 Vetus Logica, which was studied as an introduction ; the Parva
Logicalia, for the Vienna Students were Moderni : and the Nova
Logica.     §   The lists which        he quotes bears out his statement, with
this exception, that after some time the Parva Logicalia,                        not the
•'
    Ars Vetus,"      came to be looked on as the introduction               to Logic.   ||
     These quotations may, perhaps, serve to prove our assertion, that
the     scholastic use of the terms " vetus " and " nova logica
                                                                                    " is

     The point discussed in this note is of small importance                                  on its
own account, but it is                 one step, and a rather significant             one, in the
argument which tends to show that the new life in scholasticism
which expressed itself most fully in the 14th century in William
of Occam,             and    which        afterwards        developed, through          the early
natural philosophers of Italy, into                          those scientific methods which
have          rendered modern science possible, was due to the inborn
genius of western Europe, and                         was not a foreign growth cut from
 the Greek stock and engrafted on the Latin.

   cussion of the general question of the possible transition from one
   arrangement to another by change in the number of secondary

coalescence     of   two,      resulting        in    diminution         of    number.        For
example, after referring to the possible derivation of an arrangement

ordinary one with        5 and 8,       by abortion of one of the spirals                  by 8,
they add that "the series 1, 4, 5, 9 . . . does not admit of
explanation by the way of abortion, and that one can deduce it
from the ordinary series only by supposing a super foetation or
addition   of a new           spiral     among the secondary spirals                      by  8."
" This hypothesis," they continue, " appears to us altogether
improbable, since in the face of an immense number of instances
where two spirals converge               into one, we cannot on the other hand
cite one (apart from rectiserial stems) where one spiral diverges                            into
two   similar  and parallel        ones."*
   The two cones of Pinus Pinaster                        which       form the immediate
subject of Dr Dickson's paper, and for which he is indebted to the
kindness of R. Smyth, Esq., Emyvale, Co. Monaghan, Ireland, are
interesting cases of        convergence       of spirals. These, together with a
few other cases already noted                by Dr Dickson, seem to throw some
additional    light   upon      this question of the origin of variations in
the spiral arrangements in a given plant, where not unfrequently
spirals belonging to several distinct systems occur.
    In the first of   the cones received             from Mr Smyth, there is at the

the result of           a     diminution        as   compared with the                         middle.               It   has
been       already observed              by authors, moreover,                    that in such plants
as Cacti and succulent                   Euphorbias*          one vertical                 row may be split

spiral.          Now,    as   vertical rows are, in one sense, only to be regarded
as       the steepest          secondary spirals              (a       slight torsion readily                         con

   It  is impossible       to reflect on such            cases as have been adduced
and not be impressed              forcibly with the idea that, as regards their
production or origination,              diverse    spiral   arrangements       are to   be  re
garded as allied much more according to the numerical correspond
ence  of their    secondary spirals and, verticals           than   in proportion       to the
correspondence       of  their angular divergences.              Such cases, moreover,
show clearly how a generating                 spiral may change its direction on
one and    the same axis.
   It is perhaps rash to speculate               as to how the different systems             of
spirals in  Fir cones      originate.       On the whole,        Dr Dickson      is inclined
to assume      the bijugate of the ordinary system                 as the fundamental
arrangement.          He    is to some extent confirmed               in this view by         a
remarkable       abnormality         in   a cone     of P. Pinaster, gathered by
him at     Muirhouse, near Edinburgh.                     This cone exhibits a left-

rudimentary scales                  of small size      and somewhat peculiar shape are
intercalated with considerable regularity among the others, so                              as to

       At the request of the Council, Professor Tait                   gave an

     I should     not have thought of appearing before              you to-night to
  lecture on so hackneyed           a subject, had      I  not been      assured   by
  several   members of the Council           that such an address was really
  desired by many       Fellows of the Society.         It  is a subject to which
  I have not paid very special attention, partly because                 it is in   so
  many and      such good hands, and partly because (except from the
  point of view of theory) it requires for its extension, especially to

  from the College the         large amount of bulky       and delicate apparatus
  required for its proper illustration,           is (as  I   have  just found) so
  great, that    if  on  any future occasion the Society desire me to give

  meeting for that evening be held in my class-room in the                     Uni

     The subject of spectrum analysis must always possess great
  interest for this Society, inasmuch as many of its most distin
 guished promoters have been, or are, among our Fellows, ordinary
 as well as honorary, and          several   of the most remarkable memoirs

     The objects of spectrum analysis may be briefly enuntiated                    as
 follows: — To      make, by optical methods, the qualitative chemical         ana
 lysis of (1) a self-luminous body ; (2) an absorbing             medium,   whether
 self-luminous or not.
     It is difficult now-a-days, when so many philosophers are engaged
 almost simultaneously           at the   same   problem, to decide which of
 their successive       steps in advance is that to which          should really be
attached the title of discovery (in its highest sense) as distinguished
from mere improvement or generalisation. You have only to look
at the     recent voluminous         discussions as to the discoverer of the
 Conservation of Energy, to see that critics may substantially agree
as to facts and         dates,   while differing    in the most extraordinary
manner      as to   their deductions from them.*           Some of these writers,
no doubt, put themselves out             of court   at once by habitually     attri
buting the gaseous laws of Boyle and Charles to Mariotte and Gay-
Lussac.       Men who persist in error on           a  point so absolutely clear
as   this, show themselves unfit to judge in any case of even a little
more difficulty.         Others, who strongly support the so-called claims
of Mayer in the matter of Conservation of Energy, and who should
(to be consistent) therefore far more strongly advocate the real
claims of Talbot, Stokes, Angstrom, Stewart, &c., to the discovery
of spectrum analysis, are found to uphold Kirchhoff as alone en-
    * Some frantic partisans of Papin, Ac., deny almost all credit to Watt in
the matter of the steam-engine      !   No farther examples need be cited.

titled to any merit in the matter.              As  a paper by  Mr Talbot,   on the
early history of the subject, is to be read this evening,           I shall content
myself for the present with the remark, that, of the two objects of
spectrum analysis above named, Talbot and Herschel were unques
tionably foremost in the enuntiation of the first; Brewster, Angstrom,
and     especially Stokes and Balfour Stewart, in that of the second.
Why       some      of their statements       were   incomplete or inexact, and
what was required to complete or to correct them, will be more
usefully stated after          I have given some preliminary        explanations.

    Note that the source of light in all these experiments has been carbon
heated to incandescence by resistance to a powerful current of voltaic
electricity.
   I. Incandescent solids and liquids give generally a continuous spectrum.
              Its highest radiation, and the amount of radiation of each wave
           length, depend on the temperature.
              Hence the necessity of using the highest temperature we can
           obtain.
              Illustrate by different lengths of platinum wire    heated by current.
    II.  Gaseous bodies, incandescent, give generally a (limited) number of
           perfectly definite wave lengths (though under certain circumstances
           of pressure, &c., they give a continuous spectrum).          The number
           depends for each substance on its temperature and pressure, and their
           appearance is characteristic of the substance.      For, under the same
           physical circumstances, we have always the same effect — as, indeed,
           must be assumed to be the case,       if we think physics can be studied
          at all.    This   remark was   virtually  made  by Carnot, and is all that
           was wanting       in Talbot's earliest paper to make it the complete
          statement of this first part of the subject.

    The question of priority just alluded                           to illustrates            in a very
curious      way      a    singular       and      lamentable, though                   in    one    sense
honourable,         characteristic of many of the highest class of British
scientific    men     ;   i.e., their proneness to consider that what appears
evident to them cannot but be known to others.                                      I   do not       think
that this can be called modesty                    ;   it is rather      a species of diffidence
due to     their consciousness that                in general their accurate knowledge
of the published            developments               of science       is confined mainly                to
 those     branches to which they have specially devoted                                     themselves.
 Their foreign            competitors,        on       the other         hand       (especially         the
 Germans), are often profoundly aware of all that has been done,
 or, at least, have some one at hand who    and can thus, when      is,
a   new idea occurs to them, at once recognise, or have determined
 for them, its novelty, and so                instantly put         it   in type and secure it.
 Neither Stokes nor Thomson, in 1850, seems to have had the least
 idea that      he had       hit on anything new, especially as they had                                   a
 vague recollection          that Foucault had previously attacked the pro
 blem — the matter appeared                   so simple and obvious to them— and,
 but for the fact that Thomson has given                           it    in his public lectures
 ever since (at first        giving      it   as something well known), they might
 have thus forfeited           all claim        to mention          in connection with the
  discovery.    I     could mention many other striking instances of this
  peculiarity   ;    one,        in   fact,   appeared        in our own                Proceedings        a
  few months ago; but to consider                       it   more     closely would lead me
  away     from the subject of my lecture.                          It    is    sufficient to have
  called    attention       to   a    want which could easily                  be   supplied,        if   we

 1.   Note on the Early History of Spectrum Analysis.                              By
                       H. Fox Talbot, Hon. F.R.S.E.
     Newton, in his observations on the spectrum, appears never to
 have used a narrow aperture.            In fact there      was nothing,      in the
 existing state of knowledge in his day, to lead him to suppose that
 this would alter the phenomena.
     Wollaston was the first who observed some obscure bands in the
 spectrum,     by viewing with a prism the aperture left by the shutters
 of his room when nearly closed.             It  is surprising     that this acute
 philosopher did not follow up the hint thus accidentally presented
 to   him, but contented himself           with    the rude observation above
 mentioned.
     Fraunhofer was the first who detected the wonderful system                     of
 dark lines     in the solar spectrum, by viewing            a very narrow and
 accurately     formed aperture with an excellent prism, aided                  by   a
 small telescope.       He likewise      gave   names    to   the   principal    dark
 lines which     have   been   generally adopted, and he measured               accu
  rately  their    refractive    indices     by mounting        the   prism     on   a
 graduated brass circle movable round a centre.
     After completing       his observations on the solar spectrum,                he

 462                    Proceedings      of the Royal Society
 turned his attention to the spectrum of the stars,                       of which      he
 described several. He likewise described the spectrum of electric
 light, but only that of sparks passing through atmospheric air.
 He has likewise left on record a very curious observation on the
 spectrum presented         by the exterior flame of a wax candle.                 When
 the bright flame is intercepted by a screen, and only the                    faint    ex
 terior flame viewed, he found it to consist almost entirely of homo
 geneous   yellow light      ;   but his skill as an observer was so great that
 he perceived this yellow          light   to consist of two distinct        rays very
 close   together, and only separable              by an excellent prism, and            a
 very narrow aperture.            As   he remembered      that there was a similar
double ray in the yellow part of the solar spectrum which he had
named D, the happy thought occurred to him of transmitting                           solar
light through the         same aperture.         He did   so, and    found that the
two rays of the line D coincided most accurately with the double
yellow ray given by the exterior flame of a wax candle.                        He    does
not appear        to have   prosecuted         this interesting   research       further.
He merely records the fact.                He    was not aware      that the yellow
light of    the    candle was in any way caused               by the presence           of
sodium,    the existence of which in a wax candle would probably not
occur to any one, unless perhaps to an experienced chemist on the
look out for some extraneous substance.
   About the same time Sir D. Brewster had been seeking for                              a
source of homogeneous light, for the purpose of improving the
microscope by destroying all chromatic aberration of the lenses.
See his paper      of   1822 in the Transactions          of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh,     vol. ix. p. 433.        Although acquainted with the              effect of
salt on the flame of burning alcohol, he had evidently only cursorily
examined     it,   since he says " salt or nitre" which             is   incorrect, and
speaks    of its causing the flame to              yield
                                                         " insalubrious vapours."
He therefore rejects the use of            it,
                                   and merely recommends that the
alcohol should be " largely diluted with water."  The yellow light
so obtained he refers to          " imperfect combustion" (p. 435), and not
in any way to sodium,             observing that the combustion of paper,
linen, cotton, or the flame of             a   blow-pipe, also contain the same
homogeneous        yellow light in tolerable abundance.                  His observa
tions, therefore, have      a    certain resemblance to those of Fraunhofer.
  About     the year 1824 or 1825,               Dr Wollaston     gave     one    of his

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                             463
evening parties, to which men of science                  and amateurs were in
vited, and     it  was the custom to        exhibit scientific novelties,     and   to
make them the subject           of conversation.
    On the evening in question            I  brought as my contribution        to the
meeting some very thin films of glass (such as are shown in glass
houses to visitors by a workman, who blows a portion of melted
glass    into    a large    balloon     of extreme tenuity,        and    afterwards
crushes the glass to shivers).             Such    a film of glass    I  brought to
Dr Wollaston and his friends, and after showing that in the well-
lighted apartment it displayed a uniform                 appearance    without any
markings,      I  removed it into another         room, in which    I had prepared
a   spirit lamp, the wick of which had been impregnated with com
mon salt.        When viewed        by this    light, the film of glass     appeared
covered     with broad nearly parallel bands, which            were almost black,
and    might be rudely compared to the skin of                  a zebra.      Similar
bands, but much fainter, were seen by transmitted                 light.     All  pre
sent agreed that this curious phenomenon could only be due to the
extreme      homogeneity of the light of the lamp with the salted wick,
 which     much     exceeded     any previous estimate of it.            It  did not
 occur to any one that evening                to procure a lens and a plate of
 glass,   in order     to try the    effect    of the light   on Newton's       rings.
 But such an experiment tried soon afterwards revealed an astonish
 ing augmentation          of the number of rings visible.            I followed up
 this observation by publishing           a  paper in 1826 (Brewster's Journal,
 vol. v. p. 77), in which       I  determined, among other things, the fol
 lowing facts, namely, that all the salts of soda gave the yellow line
 D, which     I   therefore affirmed to be characteristic of sodium.             That
 the salts    of potash give      a  violet light, together with a single red
 ray situated almost at the end            of the spectrum,     and with no other
 light near it.        [Subsequently Brewster made careful observations
 upon this ray, and found it to be coincident with                  A in the solar
 spectrum,      a remark which         recent researches      with more powerful
  instruments have shown to be not entirely exact.                     Brewster did
  one great service      in pointing out the fact that in inquiries like this
  an achromatic      telescope   is not necessary.]
     The following is       a  quotation from this paper (vol. v. p. 77): —
  "
     The flame of nitre contains a red ray of remarkable nature. This
  red  ray possesses      a definite refrangibility, and appears          to be cha

  464                Proceedings        of the Royal Society
  racteristic of the salts of potash, as the yellow ray is of the salts of
 soda.     If this should   be admitted,     I would further      suggest  that tvhen-
  ever the prism shows a homogeneous ray              of   any colour    to exist  in a
flame, this ray indicates        the  formation    or  the presence     of a  definite
  chemical compound."
     Further on, speaking of the spectrum of red fire (such as is used
 in theatres and in fireworks),         I said, " the other lines may be attri
 buted to the antimony, strontia, &c., which enter into this compo
 sition.     For instance, the orange ray may               be the effect      of   the
 strontia, since Herschel found in the flame of muriate of strontia a
 ray of that colour       If    this opinion should be correct, and appli
 cable to the other definite rays, a glance           at the prismatic      spectrum
 of a flame may      show  it to   contain substances which it would otherwise
 require a laborious    chemical analysis to detect."
    An early    paper by Herschel has been omitted in its proper place,
 the year 1822 (Transactions            Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. ix.
 p. 455).     He there shortly describes the spectra of chloride of
 strontia, chloride of potassa, chloride of copper, nitrate of copper,
 and boracic acid.
    In  1827 (after the publication          of my experiments in 1826), he
 stated in the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana,             article on Light, p. 438,
 that salts of soda give      a  copious and purely homogeneous yellow                 ;
those     of potash    a beautiful       pale violet.     He also describes the
spectra of lime, strontia,        lithia, harytes,  copper,    and iron.
    In another paper of mine (Phil. Mag.              1834, vol. iv. p. 114), the
flames of strontia      and lithia are examined.            The following is an
extract from this paper: — "The strontia flame exhibits a great
number of red rays, well separated from each other by dark inter
vals, not to mention an orange, and a very definite bright blue ray.
The lithia exhibits one single red ray. Hence                   I   hesitate not to
say that optical analysis can distinguish             the minutest portions          of
these    two substances with as much certainty,                if  not more,      than
any other known method."
    Another    passage,   taken from the same page, records the first
observation of those peculiar rays at the violet end of the spectrum,
to which some years later Herschel gave the name of the lavender
rays.
          " The   flame  of Cyanogen                      the violet end of the
                                             separates
spectrum     into three   portions. with broad          dark intervals between.

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                          465
The last of     those portions is so widely separated        from the rest as to
induce    a suspicion that    it may be more refracted than any rays in
the solar spectrum.        This separated portion has a pale undecided
hue.    I  should hardly have called it violet were it not situated at
the violet    end    of the spectrum.        To my    eye   it had a somewhat
whitish or greyish appearance."
   This was followed by another paper of mine " On Prismatic
           "
Spectra      (Phil. Mag. 1836, vol. ix. p. 3), in which the spectra of
gold, copper, zinc, boracic acid, and barytes are described.
   Wheatstone, nearly at the same time, published some interesting
analogous researches.        I   regret not to have his paper at hand at
present, in order to give      a  full account of it.
   Brewster     then took up the subject, and described the spectra
produced by the combustion of a great variety of substances,                 in a
paper printed in the Manchester             meeting (1842) of the British
Association (see Proceedings of the Sections, p. 15).                But in the
same page there is another short paper by Brewster, of surpassing
interest, since he there announces the fact that the bright rays
which   are characteristic     of artificial   flames   are for the most part
those which are deficient in solar light, a fact previously confined
to the line D, and discovered, as we have said,                  by Fraunhofer.
These    observations of Brewster deserve            to be quoted      textually.
His paper    is  entitled " On Luminous         Lines in certain Flames cor
responding to the defective Lines in the Sun's             Light."
   After noticing Fraunhofer's beautiful discovery as to the phe
nomena of the line D in the prismatic spectra, Sir David said —
" He had received from Fraunhofer a
                                                   splendid prism,     and  upon
examining by      it the spectrum of deflagrating nitre, he was surprised
to find the red ray discovered by Mr Talbot, accompanied by several
other rays, and that this extreme red ray occupied the exact place
of the line A in Fraunhofer's           spectrum, and equally surprised to
see a luminous        line corresponding      to the line     B of Fraunhofer.
In fact, all the black lines of Fraunhofer              were    depicted in the
spectrum in brilliant red light. The lines A           and   B in  the spectrum
of deflagrating      nitre appeared     to be both double lines, and upon
examining      a solar spectrum        under favourable circumstances, he
found  bands corresponding to these double lines.               He had looked
with great anxiety to      see  if there   was anything analogous in other

466                  Proceedings of      the  Royal Society
flames, and    it would    appear that this was a property which belonged
to almost every flame."
    One  thing only      was wanting in order to complete this discovery
of Brewster's, namely,         to explain   why the rays which are bright
in artificial flames should be dark in the solar spectrum.               The  ex
planation of this fact was reserved for later inquirers.
    The above is far from exhausting             the catalogue of Brewster's
researches    on the spectrum.         He made numerous measurements of
 Fraunhofer's      lines    and maps     of   certain portions     of the    solar
spectrum.        He    likewise    discovered the extraordinary         effect of
nitrous    gas    upon the spectrum         transmitted    through     it, which
becomes     covered      with   a vast multitude     of lines, irregularly dis
posed, but always appearing            in the  same places in the spectrum,
 provided the density and temperature of the gas is the same.
2. On Some          Optical Experiments.            By H. F. Talbot, Hon.
                                      F.E.S.E.
            I. On     a New Mode of observing certain Spectra.
     The attention       of the scientific world     has been for some       years
 past fully awakened to the importance of observing the spectra
 exhibited during the combustion of chemical substances.                   But in
 making an extensive series of such experiments, it must often hap
 pen that the observer        has to test substances     of which   he  only  pos
 sesses a very minute quantity.           In that  case, before he has viewed
 the spectrum long enough to feel fully satisfied of its nature, his
 stock of the substance is exhausted, and he is obliged to leave his
 observation imperfect.          He might perhaps be testing some mineral
 in his cabinet, of which the native locality was unknown, and                  be
  might surmise it to contain         a new   metal, from its yielding a ray
  not before seen in the spectrum, yet after          a short time his observa
  tions on it would come to an end, and he would have no means of
  showing this ray to other observers.             Some   years   ago the metal
  thallium was so rare that it was only distributed by           a few   grains  at
  a  time to those who were interested in its discovery          ; and    many of
  the rarer metals are absent from most chemical laboratories, or only
  represented     by trifbng     specimens.    About four or five years ago       I
  devised   a method       of remedying, or. at least, greatly diminishing

                       of Edinburgh. Session 1870-71               .                467
this inconvenience, which, with            some    slight recent improvements,
I will   now proceed to describe.          My method was founded on a fact
which     I  had observed many years          ago, namely, that the mere pre
sence of     a chemical substance       in a flame frequently suffices to cause
the appearance of its characteristic             rays, and that it is not at all
necessary that the substance           should be consumed and dissipated.
This dissipation         is an accident, and      if by any     means      it could   be
prevented, the flame would maintain its characters for a consider
able time.       For instance, in Brewster's Journal for               1826, vol. v. p.
77,  &c.,    I remarked      that alcohol burnt in an open vessel, or in a
lamp with a metallic wick, gives but little yellow monochromatic
light, while      if  the wick be of cotton,      it gives   a  considerable quan
tity, and that for         an unlimited     time. And        I   added     that  I  had
found other instances of          a change of colour in flames, owing to the
mere presence        of  a substance    which suffers no diminution in            conse
quence.       Thus, a particle of muriate       of lime   on the wick        of a spirit
lamp will produce          a  quantity of red and green           rays for a whole
evening without being itself sensibly diminished.
    Mindful of       these   experiments     of 1826, when a few years ago              I
wished to examine the spectra of thallium and other substances, I
adopted the following plan : — A grain, or sometimes much less, of
the substance was placed in a piece of strong glass tube about one
 inch long.       Short platina wires were inserted into the tube at each
end, approaching each other            within  about   half   an inch.        The  ends
are then sealed by a blow-pipe, leaving enough                 of    the platina wire
outside the tube to allow of its being soldered to a long copper wire.
One    of   these    copper wires (with the external portion of the pla
tinum     wire soldered to it) was then coated with gutta percha for
the space      of three   or four inches next the tube.           To    coat the other
 wire was found unnecessary.             The   mode    of experimenting          was as
follows.       The tube in a horizontal         position, having the chemical
substance       nearly in its centre, was lowered          into a glass of water
about    two or three inches below the surface.                The two wires were
then   connected with a Ruhmkorffs coil, set in action by six of
 Grove's cells.        When the sparks      were   allowed to pass through the
 tube, they speedily ignited          the substance,     and     caused     it to give
 forth its characteristic spectrum.          Even after the sparks have been
 passing    for several minutes, the tube remains perfectly cold.                  This

 468                Proceedings of        the  Royal Society
 is the object of placing       it under  water, for   if that precaution is not
 taken the tube will sometimes become very hot, and explode.                         The
 gutta percha covering is to prevent the spark passing through the
 water, and to oblige it to pass through the tube.                  It   is sufficient,
 as  I  have said, to cover one wire.           If  a drop of water has been
 enclosed in the tube along              with   the chemical          substance, the
 colours of the spectra are displayed with more vivacity;                   but  if  this
 is done, it is absolutely necessary           to have     the tube well under
 water.     The bright light given off under            these circumstances by
 strontia, sodium, thallium,          and   many other substances,             is very
 beautiful, and so permanent that at the close of the experiment
 the original grain or half grain of the substance                 does not appear
 diminished,     and     even    the   drop of     water is      found     remaining
 unchanged.       Provided      always that the chemical substance is one
 not liable to decomposition under these circumstances of heat and
 moisture.      In  these    experiments      a small     Ruhmkorffs coil            was
 found to answer better than         a  very large one.
    This method might          be usefully applied to the           illumination of
 microscopic     objects by homogeneous light.                If     the   tube were
 placed    immediately      under the stage of the microscope, the full
intensity of the yellow light would fall upon the object.
    All  these experiments were made           in  the  Physical Laboratory of
the University of Edinburgh by the kind permission and assistance
of Professor Tait.
                            II.   On the Nicol Prism.
    Many years ago, when this beautiful and useful optical instrument
was new and very       little known,    I wrote a paper    in  a  scientific journal
calling attention     to its merits, and recommending              its use.      It  was
first described    by its inventor in Jameson's Journal for 1828, p. 83.
The title of the paper being " On a Method of so far increasing the
Divergency of the two Rays in Calcareous Spar that only one Image
may    be seen at a time."        This paper   was reviewed in PoggendorfFs
Annalen for 1833, p. 182,          who says — That      he perused         Mr Nicol's
account of his invention with very little hope of its proving suc
cessful, but that having constructed the instrument, he found that
nothing     could answer more perfectly than it did.                    Having      read
this testimony to its merits,        I had   one made by      a   London optician.

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                                469
which proved very successful.               I then published a paper on it in
the Phil. Mag. for 1834, vol. iv. p. 289, from which I must ask
leave to make an extract, as a necessary                   introduction     to what       I
wish to      say about it on the present occasion.
     My paper begins by quoting the testimony of the German writer
to the merits of the instrument, and continues thus : —
     " Poggendorff then goes on to say, that as Mr Nicol had not
attempted        to explain the operation of the instrument,                  he would
endeavour to do so, in which, however,                I  cannot say that         I   think
he has been entirely successful.              Now, it will be observed that the
inventor attributed the fact of the instrument's producing only one
 image to a great 'divergency' which it causes in the images,
 throwing one of them aside out of the field of view. The German
 writer follows the         same   idea, but adds, that        in his opinion such
 divergency        is caused     by the Canada balsam, whose                  index      of
 refraction being 1'549, is intermediate between that of the ordinary
 ray   1  654 and that      of the extraordinary ray          1-483, which        circum
                                                                                '
 stance will (in his opinion)            account for the rays being                thrown
                                                      '
 opposite ways.'         He   adds, that any one        who was not afraid of the
            '
 trouble       might easily calculate the path of both rays, a remark
  which    shows that his idea was that they were both transmitted,
  and diverging       from each other.        But  I find    that this great diver
  gency     does    not, in point      of fact, exist,        for by inclining          the
  instrument      a position     may be found in which                both images are
 seen, and they are then very          little  separated,    not more so than they
  were by the same piece         of spar   before its bisection and cementation.
  On gradually altering         the position     of the instrument, the             second
  image is not seen to move away from the first                    ;  but at a certain
  moment it vanishes suddenly without leaving the smallest trace of
  its existence behind.         Having thus       described      the appearances         as
   I have found them,        I will  give an explanation             of them, which        I
  hope   will   be more satisfactory.        As long    as the rays composing the
  images are incident          upon the Canada          balsam       at moderate      obli
  quities, it cannot exert any particular            discriminating        action upon
  them.       But when the obliquity        reaches a certain point, one of the
   images suffers total internal        reflexion, because        the Canada balsam
   is (with regard to that image) a less refractive                medium than calc
   spar.     But with      regard   to the other image,           it   is at the same
      VOL.  VII.                                                             3 R

470                Proceedings     of the Royal Society
moment a more refractive medium than the spar, and therefore it
suffers that image to pass alone."
   The preceding remarks        were published    in the year    1834.   Soon
afterwards    I  perceived that  if my explanation were correct, a Nicol
prism might      be made,   half of calc  spar and    half of glass. Theory
indicated this, but no actual experiment           of  the kind was made at
that time.      Recently, however,    my attention has been once more
directed to this subject, and      I have   had such an instrument        con
structed by     Mr Bryson, optician, of Edinburgh, with          a very satis
factory result.      When light has       been   polarised by an ordinary
Nicol prism, it is completely extinguished by the new prism held
in a proper position ; whereas when two Nicol prisms are com
bined, a small portion of light generally remains visible.
    Either   end   of the new prism may be held foremost, a result
which was not altogether expected.           An idea is prevalent that the
action of an ordinary Nicol prism is due to the circumstance that
one surface     of the calc spar is left rough to scatter one     of the rays.
But    such is not the case.    Both surfaces are highly polished by the
best makers, and the ray is not scattered,        but reflected,  and may be
seen by proper management.
   3.   Note on a New Scotch Acidulous Chalybeate Mineral
                  Water.     By James Dewar, F.K.S.E.
    It  is generally known that this country is extremely deficient
in well-marked        chalybeate waters.      Plenty natural waters,      con
taining    small    proportions   of iron,   are to be met with in         the
United     Kingdom     ;  but,  with   the exception      of  those   of Tun-
bridge Wells,       Harrogate,    Sandrock    (Isle of Wight), Heartfell,
near Moffat, and Vicarsbridge, in the vicinity of Dollar, they con
trast very unfavourably with those of the numerous spas of the
continent of Europe.         If we restrict  ourselves to an examination
of the chemical characters of the above-mentioned Scotch chaly-
beates, we observe that the iron is present in large quantities             in
 the form   of sulphate, along with sulphate of alumina,             on which
account they are more nauseous to invalids, and arp at the present
time rather unpopular.
    Recently my brother, Dr Alexander Dewar, Melrose, sent me for

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                        471
analysis    a sample of a new well water, whose          peculiarity had pre
viously attracted his attention.         A chemical examination of the
water in question showed it to         be a well-defined     acidulous chaly
beate,   unusually rich in carbonate of iron.         The following are the
analytical details. (As the surface water          gets access at present,   a
very exhaustive analysis appeared unnecessary)            : —
       Carbonate of iron,    .                 17-5
       Alumina,     .                            1-8
       Silica,                                   8-5
       Sulphate of magnesia,                     7-8
       Chloride of calcium,                     16-0
       Carbonate of calcium,                     41
       Alkaline chlorides,                      11-4
                  Total residue,                67-1
       Carbonic acid gas per gallon 40 cubic inches.
    With the exception of the celebrated "Dr Muspratt's chaly
 beate," at Harrogate,      which   contains 10-8 grains per gallon of
 carbonate of iron, along with 16-0 grains of protochloride,             I  do
 not know of any natural water in this country containing              such  a
 large proportion of iron in the form of carbonate.            And it is to be
 observed that the water is not associated          with a large quantity of
 other salts.
     The well   whence   the foregoing    sample was taken has not been
 long sunk, and its water is perfectly different from all of those in
 its immediate vicinity.       Should it maintain      its present character,
 I  have no doubt that, judging from its own qualities, as well as
  from its favourable climatic       situation,    along with     the general
  interest   attached  to the locality,     this chalybeate is certain      to
 recommend itself to the medical profession.

  1.  On the Homologies of the Vertebral Skeleton in                  Osseous
           Fishes and in Man.         By Professor Macdonald.
                                   Abstract.
     After   a brief notice of the seven       bi-vertebral segments    of the
  cranium in man: —
     1.  The hypo-cranial,    or the axis and atlas vertebrae, which         is
           adopted as a key to the cranial segments         ;
     2. Para-cranial,  or occipital ;
     3. Wormi-epiotic    parietal, or meta-cranial      ;
     4. Sphenoidal, or meso-cranial      ;
     5.  Ethmo-frontal — pro-cranial    ;
     6. Nasal, or apo-cranial.
     7.  Rhino-nasal.
  Professor Macdonald gave a short outline of the osteology of the
  human cranium, in order to trace the homologous osteology of the
  osseous fishes, or ichthyia.
     The great characteristic of the vertebralia is the centro-chord,        or
  axis, extending through the whole length of the animal from             stem
  to stern, around or upon which           the vertebral column has       been
  developed      This  has been demonstrated         in the very earliest type,
  both by the late     Professor Goodsir and Professor Owen in the
  Amphioxus,     where the direction of the anterior portion, as far          as
  the oral cleft, is to the tip of the     nose from the anterior portion of
  the representative   of the spinal marrow. The same proof may be
  adduced    from the condition     of the early human embryo, where
  the anterior of the embryo,     consisting of the pro-cranium and part
  of the tubercles of the spine, are at once bent downwards, towards
  the upturned coccygeal extremity         of the  spine, where the umbilicus
  is afterwards formed, when the abdominal or ventral lam in ae unite
  to close in the abdomen.    There is another flexure of the pro-cranium
  and the meso-cranium in warm blooded            vertebrata.

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                        473
     It  is very important       to notice    this last flexure as distinctly
marking the difference        between the warm and cold-blooded animals,
and to account for the necessity of the temporal squamo-zygomatic
limb-bearing girdle connecting the anterior and posterior cranium.
    From this zygoma,         or limb-bearing     zone or girdle, the maxilla
depends      as the anterior thoracic      limbs, as seen in the annulozoa
and arthrozoa.          The condyle being articulated in the glenoid
cavity, it is the upper or homotype of the brachium and femur,
and the homologue of the quadratum of the bird, hypotympanic,
and of osseous fishes (28, Owen).
    He then directed the attention to the reduced scale of the fish
cranium.        The general form, from the great depression             of the
ethmo-frontal segment, prevents the formation of a pros-encephalon,
 and even      the   meso-encephalon is crushed back into the           III.  or
 wormi-epiotic      parietal segment   ; the only encephalic cavity in the
 fish   cranium, where      not only the orbit and the convolutions and
 olfactory cells, but also the whole otic sensory apparatus with the
 cerebellum.       This segment is closed in by the development of the
 wormi-epiotic      spine, which     has   hitherto   been   described by all
 anatomists, from Cuvier and others on the Continent, and by Pro
 fessors    Owen, Huxley,       Parker,   and all their     followers,  as  the
 occipital bone in the fish.        A  careful re-examination      of the sub
 ject will correct this general and inconsiderate error. In the
 osseous fishes the occipital bone still exists in the bi-vertebral con
 dition.    It, however, contains the medulla oblongata, and their
 long spines extend upward, as they do in the human cranium, to
  nearly the wormi-epiotic spine.
     Referring to the archetype of Owen, the basi-sphenoid (5.)             was
 shown to be the last vertebral centrum, from whence the basi-cranium
  extended, without central joints, to the anterior glabella frontis.
 (13, incorrectly named vomer) is in fact the premandible or incisor
  bone. (13.) The vomer is a vertical, or mediastinal double osseous
  septum, set on the rostrum sphenoides (olivaris) in connection with
  the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid and septum nasi separating
  the olfactory cells.
     From (4)    the wormi-epiotic    tuber or spine the upper part of the
  ischium is attached by a chain of transparent bent scale-bones           con
  taining a muscle, seems the principal part of the pelvis; it has a large

474                Proceedings        of the Royal Society
tuberosity; from the inner part the ramus rises.*              From   the   inner   and
lower surface of the tuber ischii the femur (51) descends.                  It is from
the inner articulation in the fishes, instead of the external aceta
bulum in the human pelvis, that the relation between the tibia
(52) and fibula (58) is altered. The fibula is articulated within the
head of the tibia ; the femur overlaps the upper spine of the
head of the tibia.     The external malleolus         tibiae is very greatly pro
longed, and forms the great osseous sub-opercular cleft, while the
internal malleolus fibulae is embedded          in the skin behind         the tarsal
fin.
   The tarsal fin consists of calcaneum (55), astragalus (53), scaphoid
(54). These Cuvier named radius and ulna, in which he was fol
lowed by Owen, &c.          Anterior cuneiform and cuboid               tarsals (56).
The phalangeal fin rays (57).
   The mistaken homology of the pectoral fin for the anterior
instead of the posterior extremity baffles all chance of correct
homology, and      I earnestly    hope that all the      living homologists will
re-examine the subject, and adopt the system which                  I have wrought
out for between      forty and      fifty years without succeeding to con
vince the anatomists.          I put  forth this final appeal of the oldest of
living homologists who          proposed    an original      scheme      (my friend,
Professor   Grant, University College, London,                introduced       that of
the brilliant but fanciful Geoffroy St. Hilaire some years earlier),
with the firm conviction          that ere long, after        I   have retired, the
scheme now proposed         will  be adopted.

2.    Scheme for the Conservation of Eemarkable                               Boulders in
     Scotland,       and for the indication                     of their Positions       on
     Maps.         By D. Milne Home, Esq.
     Among many geological questions which wait solution, there is
probably none more interesting or perplexing                         than the agency by
which Boulders or " blocs erratiques,"                      as the French      term    them,
have come to their present sites.                   I allude, of course,      not to blocks
lying at the foot of some mountain                          crag from which they have
fallen by the decay or weathering of the overhanging rocks, but to
blocks which have manifestly been transported                             great distances,
after      being detached from the rocks of which                         they   originally
formed part.
      That many of          the large isolated blocks             lying   on our mountain
sides and on our plains               have      come    from a distance, and by some
means       of tremendous            power,     is obvious even to an unscientific
observer; and the perception of this truth by the popular mind has,
in many cases, so invested these boulders with superstitious interest,
 that they have received names                    and   given rise to legends, which
 impute the transport of them to supernatural agents.
      There are two circumstances which very plainly indicate                           that
 these stones are strangers.
      One   is,   that many of these blocks are on examination found to
 be    different     from any of the rocks prevailing                 in or near the dis
 trict where they are situated.
      The other      is,   that some of these blocks, whilst excessively hard,
 — so hard that       it   is   difficult to break off      a   portion with the hammer,
 are nevertheless round in form —       form evidently acquired by
                                                    a
 enormous friction — such friction as would result from being rolled
a     long way over        a   rough surface.
      The inference drawn from these two facts was confirmed when
 it   was discovered, as in many cases                 it   was, that rocks   of the   same
 nature as the block existed               in   a   distant part of the country, and
 from which, therefore,            it   had probably come.
      These       round shaped        blocks were the first to attract popular
 attention.         The    name     given to them in Scotland of boulders has
 no doubt been suggested                by their shape.
      It   is   accordingly only the rounded boulders which possess the

 476                 Proceedings    of the Royal Society
traditionary names        and curious legends by which         many      of them
are known.         Such names as the Carlin's Stane, the Witch's Stane.
Pech or Pict's Stone, Clachannadruid,           Kirk-Stane, Pedlar's Stane,
Thuggart      Stane, and Devil's Putting Stane, are all applicable to
rounded blocks.
    When     the geologist    turned his attention    to the subject,       it  was
soon    discovered that      there were     many blocks      equally      entitled
to be called erratic,       not round but square      shaped    ;   and which,
though discovered to belong probably to rocks at a great distance,
yet showed signs of little or no attrition.         Moreover, many of these
angular or sharp-edged blocks were comparatively soft and loose in
structure, so that they could not have been rolled, for any con
siderable distance, without being broken or crushed into pieces, or
 into sand or mud.
    On a more minute inspection and study of these erratic blocks.
certain features were noticed which seemed to indicate the forces
to which they had        been subjected.     Thus on many of them, deep
scratches,    ruts, and groovings were found, as         if sharp pebbles or
stones   harder than themselves had            been  pushed    over them,         or
squeezed     against them under great pressure.         It  was also observed
that, when a block had a long and a short axis, the longer axis was
generally     parallel   with any well marked scratches or striae                on
their surface    ;  and moreover that the direction of these striae fre
quently coincided with the direction          in which the block itself had
apparently come from the parent rock.
    These circumstances        soon   led geologists to speculate on the
nature of the        agencies    which   could have    effected     a   transport
of   the   blocks.     Some    blocks   are  of enormous size, exceeding
1000 tons     in weight.*     Many, before they could have reached the
places where       they were found, must have travelled fifty or sixty
miles, and have crossed valleys and even ranges of hills.                  In  the
county of Berwick, for example, there is a large block of gneiss,                  a
rock which exists nowhere in that county or in the south of Scot
land; and if it      came from some of the       hills in   the   Highlands, it
must have crossed, not only the valley of the Forth, but the Kil
syth, Pentland, and Lammermoor Hills.

about 1480 cubic yards of stone, and is supposed to weigh about 2000 tons.

     Sir James Hall and Sir George Mackenzie in this Society, who
were the    first to study the subject, advocated the idea of diluvial
agency.         At   a later period, ice              in various forms      was suggested as
the agent, — First, in the condition                      of glaciers filling our valleys        ;
next,     in the condition of icebergs floating over our island, whilst
under      the sea; and latterly, as a great sheet or cake stretching
from the        Arctic regions,       and       overspreading the whole of northern
Europe.
     It   is not my intention             to discuss these           theories, or say which
appears the most probable.                      I     allude to them now, merely to in
dicate the tremendous character of the agencies,                            which it is found
necessary        to invoke    for the solution of the problem, — agencies
all implying a very different condition                           of things in Scotland,      as
regards configuration          of surface and climate, from what now pre
vails.       These    phenomena are the more                       interesting,    because,   as
most      of the erratic blocks lie            above    all the   rocks, and very frequently
even above the beds          of clay, gravel,             and sand, which constitute the
surface     of the land    we inhabit, they indicate probably the very last
geological changes which occurred in this part of the earth's sur
face, and which         there are some grounds for supposing, may even
have occurred since this country was inhabited by man.
     The basis on which geologists have been obliged to build their
theories,       it must   be admitted, is somewhat                       narrow.   It   consists
merely       of observations          made          casually by individuals,        who have
noticed      certain appearances                in districts of Scotland which they
happen to have visited           ;    and,      therefore, it is little to be wondered
at, that more than           half     a century has been required for procuring
the information,        scanty       as   it    is,   which has been obtained.
     What       appears desirable for expediting                   the   solution of the pro
blem,      is   to organise   a      staff of observers,             and to parcel out the
country amongst them, for the purpose                              of observing facts likely
to   throw light on the subject, and of making these facts known
from time to time, both with                    a     view to verification, and     as a basis
for further speculation.
     It   has occurred to me, that the numerous natural history societies
and       field clubs existing in Scotland,                   would be valuable agents
in    this investigation;            and,      moreover,      that individual geologists
would be pleased to co-operate                      in their respective districts.

    I hope    no one will think that the object for which             I suggest     this
investigation, is not worthy of the trouble which                 it implies,   and of
the patronage which         I  ask     this Society     to bestow     on it.    These
erratic blocks bear the same relation to the history of our planet,
as  the ancient standing or memorial stones do to the history of                     the
early races of mankind.            These last-mentioned        stones, —sometimes
with sculpturing on them not yet understood, — sometimes arranged
in circles or other regular forms not yet explained,            — sometimes found
in connection with sepulture, are beheld and studied with interest,
on account of the gleams of             light which they throw        on the people
who erected them        ; and popular indignation justly rises, when any
of  these prehistoric     records     of our    ancestors   are destroyed or muti
lated.     The great boulder          stones    to which   I have    been    referring
would,     if  investigated and studied, in like manner                    cast   light
on the last tremendous agencies which                    have   passed over whole
regions of the earth.        It   is therefore important to have as many of
these boulders as possible discovered and examined,                     and to have
such   of them     preserved   as seem worthy         of study.     I need    not    say
how rapidly, during the last century, both classes of ancient stones
have    been disappearing       ;  and therefore,      if it  be desirable to pre
serve the most remarkable boulders, or at all events to record their
existence, and their geological features,                the investigation      which
I advocate,     cannot be too soon begun.
    Alike in illustration and in recommendation of this                  suggestion,
I  will refer   to an investigation        for the same object commenced            two
years    ago in Switzerland,         and    in the adjoining parts of France.
The design       was   twofold, — First,       the conservation      of  remarkable
boulders situated on the            Jura and in Dauphiny; and             second,    the
recording of their positions by maps, and of their characteristic
 features   by schedules.
    With this view        a circular      was drawn out, and issued by the
Swiss Geological Commission, pointing out the scientific                     bearings
of the subject, and invoking the co-operation not only of provincial
societies, but also of municipal authorities in the cantons, and of
landed proprietors.         A few extracts from the Swiss circular                 may
not be    inappropriate : —

" suggested scientific inquiries.                       It   is,   indeed, interesting to seek
"       to comprehend how enormous masses, with from 40,000 to 50,000
"       cubic feet of contents, and weighing from 800 to 1000 tons, could
"       be transported            from the Alps from which they were evidently
"       detached, to spots            40    and 50 leagues distant, crossing deep
"       valleys, such as the lakes of Geneva, Neufchatel, Zurich, Con-

              great problem has been discussed by numerous philo-

   Besides making an appeal for the conservation of boulders,                   the
same    Swiss Geological       Commission       suggested    the propriety of
marking their exact position on the Government maps.
   They farther expressed        a hope that these measures       might reach
even beyond the frontiers of Switzerland,           and   they referred to       an
offer made by a French          geologist to draw up an account of the
Erratics of Souabe, with the view of obtaining co-operation from
that quarter.
   A committee      was appointed to carry out these views, supply the
necessary    schedules and maps, and conduct the correspondence.
   I shall  next explain what resulted from the appeal.            The circular
containing     it was issued    in the autumn of      1867, and    I now quote
from a report presented to the Helvetic Society of Natural Sciences
at a meeting in August 1869, drawn up by Messrs Favre and Soret.
   They    state that, very soon after the commencement           of  the inves
tigation, it was found desirable not to limit it to boulders, but                 to
include   a description of enormous heaps of gravel, existing in many
districts, having the appearance          of ancient moraines, and in         that
view likely to throw light on          the mode in which the boulders        were
transported.      Accordingly,     instructions were given to indicate on
the maps the position       of  these    gravel accumulations as well        as  of
boulders.
   Messrs Favre and Soret then narrate what had been done during
the previous year in the different cantons, and from their report
I give   the following extracts       : —
   In   the first place,    they acknowledge the liberality          of  Colonel
Siegfried, the     Director of the Federal Topographical          Department,
in supplying maps to assist in recording the observations.
   They farther acknowledge the assistance which Colonel Siegfried
had    given to the      investigation,      by issuing   instructions    to   the
engineers surveying the slopes of the Jura, to indicate on the             maps,
and to describe in their reports, any remarkable erratic blocks              they
met with.
   Reference is next made to the proceedings of the societies                 and
clubs in the different cantons.           In  some of the   larger  cantons,     as
 Lucerne and Vaud, the country had been divided into five                and six
compartments, and        a  small sub-committee of members             had been
 appointed to explore each.          In  one of these cantons,   the  municipal

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                       481
authorities      had given orders to the inspectors of roads and bridges
to aid in the investigation.
     In the canton of Zurich, notice is taken of          one remarkable block,
known       as the     "Stone for the sacrifices of Hegsriiti," which          had
been      purchased by the Society of Antiquaries, and had                   been
brought into the town of Zurich.
     In the canton of Soleure, blocks of enormous size, and to the
number of 228, had been marked, and appointed by the municipal
authorities       to be preserved,    these    blocks being situated on lands
belonging       to the canton.     The celebrated block of Steinhof, weigh
 ing about       1400    tons, had been purchased by means           of a special
 subscription,      and made over    in property to the Helvetic Society.
     Several landed proprietors are named as having gifted particular
 boulder stones         to the societies.    Thus Mr Briganti, at Monthey,
 had gifted to        the Helvetic Society one block out of a remarkable
 group, of which         I well remember the late Principal Forbes once
 spoke in this Society, and which             I  had lately an opportunity       of
  visiting.     So also     Mr Bonneton of Genera had           presented   to the
  Alpine Club of that town             a piece     of land, containing    what is
 described as a magnificent boulder, and known by the name of the
  " Stone of Beauregard."
     Even the Federal Government of Switzerland had condescended
  to share in what really         seems    to amount almost to a national
  movement; for reference is made to an official communication from
  the Chancellor,        stating that the Council of State had caused an
  order to be issued, that all erratic blocks situated in the cantonal
  forests should be preserved intact,         till examined by    the committee.
      I have had sent to me a printed report of the steps taken in the
  canton of Aargau, drawn out by Professor Miihlberg.                   He   men
  tions that one of the measures          taken there, was the appointment
  of   a referee    to inspect the boulders which were discovered, with
  the view    of determining      whether they were worthy of being pre
  served.      Professor Miihlberg mentions farther, that " the State
  " undertakes the
                           expense of printing and postages,         as well as  of
  "  the   travelling of the canton         referee   to the sites   of the   most
   "
     important boulders, and had in the meantime advanced 100 francs
   " to
         defray expenses already incurred."
      These extracts from the reports, of which printed copies                have

432                     Proceedings       of the Royal Society
been       kindly sent   to me by Professor Favre of Geneva, show what
is doing in Switzerland for the promotion                  of   an object which, under
the auspices of this Royal Society,               I should          wish to see taken up
in Scotland.          And    before concluding      what        I   have to say about the
Swiss movement,           I may   refer to one circumstance which ought to
be       gratifying   to Scotchmen, viz., that the Swiss naturalists retain
a    grateful recollection of what has been done by Scotchmen                             for
exploring and making known the interesting                            physical features of
their beautiful        country.     Not only have they, in specifying                    the
names of geologists who have written on Switzerland, included all
the Scotchmen who have done so, but                   I     see in one       of Professor
Favre's                        in connection with this movement,
              pamphlets, written
allusion to the year 1741,  " when (he says) the English first pene-
" trated into the valley of Chamounix," — " and gave to that valley
" a celebrity, which the previous visits of several bishops had not
" obtained for it."  Professor Favre records the names of these
                                     " Lord
English visitors, and among them are        Haddington and his
" brother, Mr Baillie." The pamphlet mentioning these names I
sent to the present Earl of Haddington, that he might see the
courteous      allusion to his ancestor; and, in returning the pamphlet,
he referred me to a paragraph in Douglas's Peerage, which                             men
tions the fact that, in the year 1740, the Earl of Haddington                            and
his brother, George, set out on their travels to the Continent, and
were       for some time located with other friends at Geneva — one
of these being Stillingfleet, famous in his day as a naturalist, and
who in one of his works alludes to the very agreeable reunions of his
countrymen which took place at Geneva and the neighbourhood.
     I    will next refer briefly     to    the    steps    taken       in the south of
France in       co-   operation with the Swiss movement.                    These began
by a communication from Professor Favre to Mons. Belgrand, who,
besides being President of the Geological Society of France, was
Inspector-General           of Bridges and Roads, a Government                      Depart
ment.        This communication, which explained                       the object   of   the
Swiss investigations, and also what was being done by the different
cantonal societies and municipalities,              was referred by Mons. Ber-
trand to two members,           Messrs Falsan and Chantre, to report on.
     It   is from their report, the remarks of Mons. Bertrand upon                        it,
and some notes of        a   subsequent    date, published in the Transactions

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                       483
of the Geological Society of France for December                 1869,   that   I
make the following extracts :—
    The great interest attaching        to the investigation   is allowed by
the reporters, and a compliment is paid to the Swiss naturalists for
commencing and urging it.
    Reference     is made to the rapid disappearance of the boulders,
and especially limestone boulders, which were generally broken
up for limekilns.        The reporters state that near Lyons, the greater
part of the boulders had been destroyed long ago, and in particular
one weighing        about 150 tons, which marked the point where the
boundaries of three parishes met.
     Examples, however, of remarkable boulders still untouched, with
 legends     attached to some, are specified, such as the " Pierre du
 Bon Dieu," of       120 tons, and the    " Pierre du Diable," of      56 tons,
 which it is strongly recommended should, with many others of               less
  note, be saved from destruction or injury.
     Reference is then made to the steps which should be taken to
 carry out these views.        Circulars,  it is said, should   be drawn up,
  and sent not only to the public departments which superintend the
  management of Government or communal lands, but also to indi
  vidual landed proprietors, pointing out the scientific interest attach
  ing  to these erratic blocks.
     These suggestions were at once favourably            responded to and
  acted   on.    Three public    departments or functionaries,       viz., the
  Minister of Public Works, the Director-General of Forests, and
  the Prefects in each of the provinces of Savoy, High- Savoy, Ain,
  Rhone, and Isere — all adjoining Switzerland — are stated to have
  lent their willing co-operation.
     After  the project had received the approbation       of the Geological
  Society of France, and the promise of important official support, an
  appeal to the friends     of Natural    Science was drawn up by Messrs
  Falson    and   Chantre very similar     to the appeal    which had been
  previously drawn out and issued          in Switzerland.      This    appeal,
  after describing     the movement and proceedings in Switzerland,
                      "
  proceeds thus: — Such is the object pursued vigorously in Switzer-

                       co-operation of departments and of individuals.

    Besides this appeal,                   printed copies of which were extensively
circulated, directions and schedules were drawn out to be trans
mitted to local societies as well as to individuals who should under
take the investigation,                   in particular districts,          maps   of   these districts
being at the same time supplied.

I   have said, transmitted to me                         by   Professor Favre of Geneva.                He
wrote to me at the same time, and concluded his letter by saying,

     I   have     alluded to the existence throughout                      Scotland of many
provincial         societies whose          objects are not inconsistent                   with the
investigation which               I think   they may be invited to engage in.                     Sir

hope that, when our proceedings are                     published, this list may appear
in   it,      so that   if   any societies or clubs are seen to have been omitted,
the omission may be taken notice of and supplied.

   Being myself a member of one of these Societies, I know that
some of its members have devoted themselves to the subject of
boulders, and of moraine-looking         deposits, occurring   within     the
district over which the operations of the Society extend.
   Sir Walter Elliot tells     me that he has information      of  a FieM
Naturalists' Club in England which has specially directed its atten
tion to the boulders of the district.
   It  is quite true that,  in Switzerland   and  in the south of France
boulders, considerable in size and numbers, are much more             abun
dant than in Scotland, so that little searching is required to enable
the provincial societies of these countries, to carry out the investi
gation proposed to them.
   On the other band, let it not be imagined, that in Scotland            the
boulders generally are not of such interest as to deserve the          adop
tion  of proceedings similar to those now being adopted in Switzer
land and France.       Even within the limited range of my own dis
coveries,  I know and    have measured   eight boulders in the south-east
of Scotland, the smallest of which is 10 tons and the largest             918
tons in weight, and all possessing features more or less significant.
   There are others equally large which        I have  heard of, but    have
not seen.     Moreover, almost all these boulders have old traditional
names, and many of them legends which indicate, that they haw
been objects of popular and even superstitious regard.
   There are two objects which ought to be aimed at.           The   first is
to obtain a    list of all boulders which    appear remarkable   ; i.e., re
markable for size, and instructive        on  account of polishing,      rut>
on the surface,    or any other circumstance.       The second is    to put
down on maps, a mark to represent the exact position          of bouldor>.
occurring in groups, or    of large individual boulders.

                       of Edinburgh,        Session       1870-71.                        487
     Moreover, accumulations of gravel, sand, or clay in any district,
in   so far as they seem to have             been       produced by agents now no
longer operating in the district, should                 be notified.
     In   order to carry out these suggestions,                 I   would venture very
respectfully to ask that the Council of this Society should pass a
Special Minute expressing approval of the subject explained in
this paper, and appointing a Committee of the Fellows of this
Society to carry out farther proceedings. The circumstance that
this Society had expressed its approval, and taken steps to aid the
investigation,        would alone ensure for it a favourable consideration.
     The Committee would, of            course,    communicate with the various
provincial societies throughout Scotland, by enclosing                               a copy of
this paper or an abstract of          it,
                              and intimating readiness                           to send the
necessary Schedules and Directions,                    should       a   willingness     be ex
pressed to enter on the investigation                  proposed.
 I      have in these remarks alluded only to the steps necessary                           for
discovering the existence of remarkable boulders, indicating                              their
position     on   a   map, and obtaining          a    correct description            of them.
But the other object, which also                  engages       attention        so much in
Switzerland       and France, should not be lost sight of here.                      I  allude
to the conservation of boulders.              The disappearance of numerous
camps, buildings, standing             stones, and other objects                of   archaeolo
gical interest in all our counties, which every one now regrets, has
been owing in         a   great measure to ignorance on the part of the pro
prietors     and tenants on whose            lands they were situated, of the
value and even nature of these objects. But this work of destruction
has been happily now stopped,               and chiefly by the interference and
influence of our Society of Antiquaries.                     In like manner, the        demo
lition of Boulders which             has been going            on   rapidly in Scotland,
will,I    hope, be arrested,     when the proprietors and tenants on whose
lands they stand, are made aware                  of   the    interest they excite, and
of what      is   being done to preserve them in other countries.                           Of
course,    it   would only be certain boulders which                    it   would be desira
ble to preserve,       boulders remarkable for size, or shape, or position,
or for markings            upon them    ;   and        when    a    report was made to
the Committee          of any boulder of this description, the Committee
would judge whether an application                      should be made to the pro
prietor on whose lands          it   was situated, to spare the stone, so that               it

488                Proceedings of       the  Royal Society
might be preserved for examination and study.              I have little    doubt
that such an appeal would be attended to.               Indeed, in the great
majority of cases, a proprietor would be pleased            to learn, that an
object of scientific interest had been discovered on his estate, and
would be glad to have it in his power to accede to any request in
relation to it coming from a Committee of this Society.
    With regard to     the mode of meeting the expenses           attending the
investigation     and other proceedings suggested            in this paper,      it
occurs to me that subscriptions from individuals            should be chiefly
relied on, and that the Council of this Society should only promise
such aid as the state of the Society's funds and their appreciation
of the proceedings of the Committee, may suggest to them. The
Committee will, no doubt, make a Report at least once a year of
their proceedings, which the Council            may allow to be read at a
meeting of the Society,       if its contents were sufficiently interesting.
 3.   Note    of a New Form of Armature and Break for                              a
    Magneto-Electric Machine.                By R. M. Ferguson, Ph.D.
    The magneto-electric         machine, which     I  am about to describe,
 approximates in its general arrangements toLadd's baud-machine.
 In it Mr Ladd makes use of a compound Siemens' armature, con
 sisting of two separate       armatures placed     in length, and revolving
 round the same axis, with their coils at right angles to each other.
 The armature revolves        between    the poles of an electro-magnet, of
 the description introduced by         Mr Wilde.      The electro-magnet,         in
 the present instance, is made        of a rectangular piece of boiler-plate,
 three-quarters of an inch in thickness, bent so as to form three sides
 at right angles   to each other, as shown     (in section) in  fig. 1 .  The  up
 right  sides  (P P' P)  are nearly 9 inches high and 11 inches         in length,
 and the top of the same length is 6 inches broad.               Pieces of cast-
 iron  (N and S) are put in the open end to form the poles of the mag
 net. About 300 yards of a double No. 14 wire, wrapped round the
 upright sides, make the coil (C C C C) of the electro-magnet.                 One
 of the armatures in Ladd's machine furnishes a current to the                 coil
 of the electro-magnet      ;  the other gives out an external            current.
  To distinguish     the two, the counterparts of which occur in                the
  arrangement     I  bring before     you,  I shall call the first the inter

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                       489
nal current, and the second the external current ; and the coils
furnishing them I shall designate the magnetic coil and the electric
coil respectively.        The action of the magnetic coil is based on
Siemens'    and Wheatstone's       principle of reciprocal increase.   When
a Siemens'      armature     revolves between     the poles of an electro
 magnet, what      feeble    magnetism     there may be in the iron core
 generates   a feeble   current in the armature coil.      This current, by
 a commutating      arrangement of revolving collar and springs, is sent
 into the coils of the electro-magnet, which in        consequence   rises in
                                            i  C
                                      Fig. 1.
  power.    It  is now able      to excite a stronger    armature current,
  thereby rendering itself still more powerful, and this mutual action
  goes   on until   the driving force is insufficient      to  continue   the
  action.   Ladd has ingeniously       turned this principle to account in
  his machine, the magnetic coil of which furnishes electricity for
  the electro-magnet, and this last is thereby rendered competent to
  generate  electricity in the electric coil available for external use.
     Wishing to make a machine to give off a current equal to a few
  cells of Bunsen,   I   thought of trying the following deviation from
  Ladd's construction :— Instead of having two separate armatures
  revolving on the same axis,       I thought    one might serve, in which
  two coils were inserted, the one at       right angles to the other.     In
  the revolution of    a  Siemens' armature there are two polarities, so

to speak, oue only              of which is utilised, viz., that which takes                              place
(fig. 2) when the greatest length of the iron core lies in the line
joining the two poles ; the other polarity ensues when this main
axis is perpendicular                    to the      line of      poles      (fig. 3).         This    second
                         Fig.   2.                                               Fig.    3.
polarity     is,   from the less favourable position of the core, necessarily
weaker than the first                ;   but   it   struck me that        it   might be quite suffi
cient to furnish the internal current, leaving to the more powerful
polarity the task of generating                          the external            current.             Another
advantage          seemed to flow from this utilisation.                         When an armature
without       coil       or closed         circuit      revolves          within        a     magnet, the
energy expended                 in its motion            heats         its particles.              When     the
core   is   provided with a coil and closed circuit, part of this energy,
instead of assuming                      the form of heat,              is    transmuted             into the
energy of an electric current, and the electricity                                        induced       is   so
much deducted from the heat that would otherwise appear in the
armature.           In    the ordinary construction the weaker polarity, being
unprovided with             a    coil, results only in heat; but                  if     it    be furnished
with such,          as in        the     arrangement         I     suggest,       and         its molecular
energy thereby tapped, so to speak, the heat of the armature may                                             be
partially withdrawn in the shape of an electric current.                                           A   current
sufficient to magnetise the electro-magnet may thus be got, for no
additional expenditure of force, but only by the conversion of heat
that would otherwise be mere waste, so far as the action of the
machine was concerned.                         When     one of     Wilde's small               machines,      in
which   a    battery of permanent magnets                         is   used instead of an electro
magnet,      is    turned by the hand, additional                         resistance          is   felt on the
                                                                              by
armature circuit being closed more especially                                 a     short wire.            The
current       got from the                armature would thus seem                            to   be formed
partially from the conversion just mentioned, and partially from                                              a
new access          of   force demanded by the creation of the current.                                      In
the arrangement            I         here describe,     a    different action takes place, for
when the coil of the electro-magnet                          is   disjoined from the magnetic
coil and included in the circuit of                      a   single Bunsen cell, the feebng

                         of Edinburgh, Session        1870-71.                 491
of diminished           resistance is nearly as decidedly felt as that of in
creased resistance in Wilde's machine on closing the electric coil
circuit.       The     same    feeling is not so decided in the case of the
magnetic coil, and this, no doubt, arises from its smaller dimensions               ;
at any rate, there is no additional force needed.             Whether this action
has     its origin in     an essential difference in the action of permanent
magnets         and   electro-magnets in these circumstances, or in some
peculiarity of construction, is immaterial to the present inquiry,
for to all appearance the armature currents cost no additional
 energy,      but are got entirely from the waste heat of the armature.
      The core of     the armature (fig. 4 a) is 11 inches long and 2£ inches
 in diameter.          The main longitudinal       cut or groove
 is 1§ inch wide and £ inch deep.                 The small cut
 is | of an inch wide and £ of an inch deep.*                   In
 the large cut is wound the electric coil, consisting
  of   a cable   of  8   silk-insulated    wires, j\ of an   inch
  in diameter, and 82 feet long.              The magnetic coil
  in the small cut is made of a              cable of four such
                                                                     Fig. 4 a.
  wires, 46 feet in length.              The electric coil thus
  contains about four times as much wire, and offers about the same
  electric resistance as the magnetic coil.
      The two grooves leave four protruding ends at each end of                 the
   armature.       To these are screwed a bronze cap and spindle of              re
   volution (figs. 4 and 5, which are on a larger scale than fig.              4 a).
                     Fig.   4.                           Fig. 6.
   A.  collar of wood (a) is fixed next to the spindle, and on this collar
   two ferrules of iron         (//  fig. 5) are put, separated by the wood to
   prevent contact.          To these ferrules the wires from the coils ( + - )
   are soldered,     care    being taken to prevent unnecessary contact.           A
   cylindrical    collar (C C fig. 4) turns on the ferrules, and can              be
   turned round and fixed in any position by screws (s s fig. 4).              The
   collar is made up of three parts, two pieces of iron (one is shown
         * In the figure both cuts to be shown clearly appeal of the same size.

 492                Proceedings of        the   Royal Society
 in fig. 7) cut out of the same tube and kept from touching, by being
 fixed to a vulcanite ferrule (y in fig. 6, which shows the inside of
 half the collar)     placed inside and between         them.     The ends of the
 iron pieces slide on the iron ferrules beneath, and are in conducting
 connection with them.          Electrical contact     is made by springs press
 ing   on this composite collar, and which are metallically              connected
  with the binding screws, the poles of the armature coils.              The collar
 and springs at each end form            the breaks or commutating          arrange
 ment of their respective coils.          The cross line of separation        (e efig.
 4) can be fixed in any position, and            currents in one or different
 directions   thereby obtained in the course of a revolution.                     The
 pressure   of the springs against the collars is regulated by            screws.
                   Fig. 6.                                Fig. 7.
    When the machine is prepared            for working, the cross lines of the
 commutating collar of the magnetic coil are placed at right angles
 to the plane    of the coil,    the  position of maximum effect.              If  the
 handle of the machine be turned when the circuit of the electric
coil is open, one or two turns bring the hand of the operator to
something      like   a   dead   halt ;   the resistance to       further    motion
 is  so   great    as    to  challenge      its  continuance.        If, now,      the
external circuit be closed, immediate              relief is felt, as    if  part of
the internal current had been diverted into the external                      circuit
from the coils of the electro-magnet.             The relief thus experienced,
moreover,    bears some proportion to the         conductivity of the external
circuit.    With    an easy circuit, the work expended             in turning      the
handle is easy; with          a resisting     circuit,   the driving resistance
becomes correspondingly          great. The hand is thus made to sym
pathise with the nature of the external circuit, and the experi
menter feels as      if  he were charged mechanically           with a resistance
offered electrically.       Suppose,    for instance, we have a piece of thin
wire to heat or melt;        at first little or no driving resistance is felt,
but the moment that the wire begins to get hot, the arm becomes
charged with a heavy resistance, which grows as the wire rises in
temperature     till it melts, and then suddenly the excessive no-circuit

                       of Edinburgh, Session            1870-71.                    493
resistance is felt.         The moment that there is hard work to be done
in the external circuit,         the strength of the arm is put to the proof.
When water is          decomposed       by the machine, the strain upon the
arm does not rise beyond a certain amount, at whatever speed the
handle be driven.            In  working     an induction      coil, the load on the
arm    appears      capable    of rising   to any extent, and           the length or
density     of the spark        bears   something       like   a proportion      to the
burden of work.           With   an electric resistance great enough, and an
inexhaustible        driving   power, there seems          no  limit   to the electric
effect attainable, and that, too, with            little increase of     speed.
    When        a  tangent galvanometer          is interposed      in the external
circuit, something          may    be learned      of the way this        takes   place.
With      an easy      circuit, where little difficulty is felt in driving,             a
current of about 60° may be got.                When     a thin wire is now inter
posed, the needle does not reach this point, for the wire (iron wire
     inch in diameter) melts or ignites between 30° and 40°, and yet
 while the heating lasts the strain is enormously greater than before.
 If  the galvanometer be inclosed in the internal                    circuit,  and   the
 wire melted in the electric circuit, just at the point when the heat
 ing begins, the       needle   takes a sudden       swing upwards.         Thus,   if it
 be at 20° before         the heating sets in, it will rise to 30°, and stay
there   till   the wire melts, when,      if  the motion be continued, it again
takes a start upwards.            If the magnetic coil be detached            from the
 coil of the electro-magnet, and           if  its function be performed by one
 Bunsen      cell, this increase      of load is      not felt, a greater effect in
 the external circuit being only attainable by an increase in velocity,
 and the same holds with a battery of permanent magnets.
    That two       separate coils, by being imbedded            in the same piece of
 iron, should thus act upon each other seems strange.                    One might al
 most   think that it     arose from the particles       of iron refusing to polarise
 and unpolarise quick enough.              The maximum speed of revolution
of the armature         is about 2500 times a minute.              The driving gear
 multiplies       22 times, so that this speed           is nearly as much as the
 arm can effect.         A particle of iron would have thus 10,000 times
 to polarise and unpolarise in a minute.                A little consideration will
 show, however, that it is from no such incapacity on the part of
 the iron    ;  for at the same rate of revolution, the two effects are felt
 with the different circuits.          Speed in these cases, therefore, has not
    vol..  vn.                                                              3 u

494                    Proceedings          of the Royal Society
overshot the mark.              The cause of the action appears to             me as fol
lows    : — When     the line     of   the armature (fig. 8) is vertical      — when,      in
fact, the strongest action is taking place in the small coil —the                     wires
of the large coil cut           the    lines of magnetic force between N            and S
at  right angles,       the best time and the best place for a current to                  be
induced in them.            Although,        then, the longitudinal       polarity of     the
iron has disappeared, the coil takes up the action                   and makes a north
and a south end, even when the                   main line of the armature           is up
right, and should           be free        from polarity.       This coil induction         or
polarity is feeble, contrasted with that resulting                    through the       iron,
and     would have little effect              if the coils were      near   each other in
size.      It  is only     in the present case, where             there is such       a dis
parity between          the coils, that the interference grows to               a sensible
amount.         In support of this view of               the   matter, it may be       men
tioned that when             the    larger coil is connected with the electro
                                      magnet,      little relief    is felt on     an easy
                               -      circuit    being made for the smaller coil.
                                      The effect of the interference is to            lessen
                                      the current       induced in the smaller coil.
                                      A particle     at o, for instance (fig. 8), which

              *"'S- 8.                 electro-magnet would give its full quota
of electric induction, is by the cross polarity magnetically                          forced
round,       so   to speak,       into      a less   favourable     position    for    doing
so.       But how is this interference stopped                  by a resisting external
 circuit?       In this way,         I   imagine.      The    available electro-motive
 power may take the form of large quantity                         in an easy       circuit,
 or   little quantity         in   a     resisting    circuit.     On    consulting         the
 galvanometer in a resisting circuit,                    while the strength       is taxed
 to the utmost, the current is often found weak.                      It  is the quantity
 of electricity that is the cause of the interference, and not the work
 value of the circuit.           When the strength of the electric current is
 great with a      resisting circuit, that of the magnetic current has been
 proportionally        exalted.
    The interference of the two coils with each other can be shown
 in a   simple way.         When the coil of the electro-magnet is                detached
 from the magnetic coil and joined up with a Bunsen cell, we have,
 on turning the handle, both armature coils prepared to give ex

                              of Edinburgh, Secsion 1870-71.                                     495
ternal currents.               If, in the circuit of         the electric coil, a few inches
of fine platinum wire   be included, and the circuit of the magnetic
coil half completed, so that one end of the connecting wire has only
to touch the other binding screw to close     and the handle be putit,
in sufficient motion, the platinum wire becomes white hot, and this
sinks      to   a   dull   red when contact            in the magnetic circuit            is   made.
The       same takes place when the coils are reversed.                            Such an action
as   this suggests the supposition that what                             appears    in the   second
coil     is   but electricity stolen from the first, and that the arrangement
effects only         a   convenient          distribution,      and    not an increase of the
electricity available.               I      cannot, with the observations            I   have     yet
made, say that such                 is   not true in all cases, but in one case, at least,
the only one        I      have examined, such              a   supposition cannot be enter
tained, and that               is   when both coils work together in the same
circuit.          When both coils,              as   just mentioned,          are ready to give
external currents under the magnetism induced by one Bunsen cell,
it   is   quite possible, by accustoming the ear to the note produced by
the springs rubbing on the revolving collars, to get the arm to work
at   a    uniform speed.              If   the cell be steady, you can, within               a   frac
tion of       a   degree,      produce the same angle in the galvanometer in
the same            circumstances.          I    have made            repeated     observations in
this way as to what current the electric coil would give when act
ing alone, as to what the magnetic coil would give, and as to what
both together would effect.                     The circuits in these cases consisted of
the coils themselves and                      the wires leading to          a    tangent galvano
meter some 12 feet off, and the working                               of the machine and the
observing of angles                 were done by different persons.                The resistances
in both circuits               were       sensibly    the    same.       The resistance        of the
electric coil was 32 inches of                    a   German silver wire in my posses
sion, that of the magnetic coil 34, and that of the galvanometer
wire      5   inches.         To    these must be added the resistance introduced
by the imperfect contact of the break-springs, which, at                                     a   high
speed, and especially in the case of the                          machine exhibited            where
the armature             is   not quite truly centred, must be considerable.                     The
difference between the two coils would thus almost disappear on the
total resistances of their respective circuits.This being the case,
the work value of the electricity appearing in each will be as the
squares of the tangents of the angles observed.    Now, in all the

496                   Proceedings of                the   Royal Society
observations      I   have made, the sum of these for the two coils sepa
rately was approximately equal to that obtained when both currents
were sent into the galvanometer circuit.                                  To give   an idea of how
nearly this comes out,              I    may cite         one observation           repeated      three
times in succession with the same result.                                  I   found the angle of
both together to be 47|°, that of the electric coil separately                                       40°,
and    that of the magnetic coil separately 34°.                               Now the square of
the tangent of 47 £° is 1-1909,                 and        the     sum      of those of the other
two 1-15905.
     The theory of the machine,                     as    I   understand          it,   may     be thus
shortly summed         up.      In       one case, namely, that of an easy common
circuit, and    it    is   likely   to be more or less so in all cases, the two
coils contribute each their full quota to the total electric fund of
the armature.      When the resistance of the circuits differ, this fund
is   divided inversely in some function of the relative resistance, but
whether this takes            place so as to excite the electro-magnet                            at no
original     expense        of driving energy                 is   still   a   matter for further
determination.         The results got from the machine would lead us to
suspect as much, for they compare favourably with machines where
a permanent battery of magnets                       is    used    ;   but this test, though           s.,
far satisfactory,      is   far from exact.
     The interference of the coils seems to me to be                            a   hopeful feature
of the arrangement, as              it     does not make increased                      power simply
dependent on increased                  velocity.         There      isa    promise in     it   that   by
adjusting the relative sizes of the coils                        a   powerful current may              be
got at   a   really practicable speed, and there would thus be obviated
the   serious objection to this class of machines, which, however
astonishing in their power, are apt to wear themselves out by their
rapid rate of motion when kept in action for days together.                                         Even
in the machine before you,                 if   the collars were properly turned and
centered,     so as to give good             contact with the springs at all rates
                                            to believe           that its effective speed              of of
revolution,   I   have        reason
revolution would be very much diminished.
     In mentioning what             a     machine like this can do, considerable
latitude must be understood in interpreting results.                                    The   strength
or ardour     of different workers may tell very differently.                                 The   only
fair way would be to give the electric effect corresponding to                                         a
weight falling so far per second, but this involves opportunities                                      of

experiment          which         I   have not at my command.                            When      I   say that
6   inches of soft iron wire                ^     of   an inch in diameter can be melted or
ignited by         it,
                   I         only mean to say that the arm of an ordinary man,
working briskly for                   a   second or two, can accomplish this, though                         it
would be hard work for him to continue the same for                                                a   minute.
A    stronger arm            than usual, or             a      more ardent labourer, would do
much more than this.                       A   battery of six Bunsen cells,                    each with an
effective surface of 42 square inches, melted                                     5    inches of the same
wire.      With                  spark of 1£ inches can be got with
                     an induction coil                 a
an expenditure of labour that may be continued for   minute or two                       a                   ;
with intense exertion                 a    spark of        5   or even more inches may be got.
By working reasonably for                       a      minute from            2£   to   4    cubic inches of
explosive gas can be got from                          a   voltameter;            working very hard for
a   quarter of           a   minute at the rate                    of    6   inches or more may be
obtained.          To turn        a       handle some 100 times                   a    minute, more espe
cially against           some resistance,              is   not work that can be easily con
tinued for minutes                ;   and such machines, when driven by the hand,
are only good            for incidental, not continuous use.                                 To keep down
the    pull     on the hand                with    a    resisting        circuit, the commutating
collar of the magnetic coil has to be turned round from its position
of maximum effect.                        There    is   a   certain speed at which the hand
can best work, for slow and difficult                              motion         is   not so convenient
nor attended by so good results as quick and easy motion.
    The machine              is   well adapted for an educational instrument, viz..
for illustrating electro-magnetic                              action.       If   the    electro-magnetic
coil be joined with one cell of Bunsen, and the electric coil with
five or six cells, the conditions                      of the machine             are reversed; and now
electricity produces motion, instead of motion producing electricity.
The handle          is   made to go round with considerable velocity, and                                    if
the belt that connects the gearing with the handle be removed,                                              the
armature alone spins round at                           a      great rate.         If    now the poles of
the magnetic coil be joined,                       the armature instantly slows, and the
slowing       is   all the more marked the less the resistance of the circuit
offered.        The current of this new circuit can raise to                                   a   white heat
about   a   ^   inch of fine platinum wire.                        It    may be worth mentioning,
that the current given off by the magnetic coil under these condi
tions   is    singularly          steady,       and that its strength                   is   something like
inversely proportional                     to the circuit          resistance.           This slowing of

 498                 Proceedings of         the   Royal Society
 the armature seems at variance with what              I  have stated before, that
 less instead     of more    driving resistance is felt in closing either of
 the armature circuits, for here the new current seems to               be paid for
 out of the motion of the armature.            The discrepancy may possibly          be
accounted for by the consideration that both coils are now                   antago
 nistic in their action, and that whatever part of the induced               current
appears     in the magnetic coil, from whatever source derived,                  goes
directly    to oppose     the conditions        favourable to motion, and         that
between     the opposing actions more heating in the core may be the
accompaniment or equivalent of slower motion.                    When    the coil of
the electro-magnet is joined with the larger (electric) coil, so that a
wire has only to touch the unconnected binding screw to close the
circuit, and when the arm puts the machine into rapid motion, it                      is
brought to an instant, one might say an impotent halt, on the                     wire
touching the binding screw.              One cannot help thinking, in trying
such an experiment, that coil-brakes or drags may be yet extensively
used in machinery.
     Whether this machine be any improvement or even                     a   rival    to
existing machines,       I do not pretend to say.        I only wish in this    paper
to bring      the peculiarities     of its action before       the notice of        the
Society.

  1.  On  a  Property of Self-Conjugate           Linear  and Vector Functions.
     In the course     of an investigation connected           with the free     rota
tion of   a  rigid body    I was led to the remark that,         if £ and  r] be

vectors related to one another so that
where     3>  is a self-conjugate       linear and vector function,        we    have

                                                =  1 ,

The surface of       the  third  order, represented      by either of the two
latter equations, is well known,          and    the property above shows a
curious relation between certain of its vectors and those of a central
surface of the second order.          It  has also interesting applications
to the lines of curvature of the surface.
    If £ and  17  be unrestricted, the theorem above maybe put in the
more general form that the two following                 equations   are  conse
quences one      of the other, viz. :—
                              £       -      V.i?9"7
     From either of them we obtain the equation
 which, taken along with one of the others, gives            a singular theorem
 when translated into ordinary algebra.
     2. Relation between     corresponding Ordinates of two Parabolas.
     Two projectiles     are  anyhow     projected     simultaneously    from   a
 point, what is the relation       between      their vertical heights at any
 instant  ?
     This simple inquiry, which      was instituted in consequence       of some
 results recently obtained from thermo-electric experiments (see ante.
 p. 311) carried on at high temperatures, where the indications given
 by two separate circuits, immersed in the same hot and cold bodies,
 were used    as ordinate    and   abscissa,   leads   to a very curious conse
 quence.
     Let
                                x =  At (B    -   f)
 and
                               y  =
                                     A7(B'
                                              -   t)
  be   any two parabolas whose         axes    are vertical,    and  which   pass
  through the origin.       We   have
                         A'x  - A// r            K'x  —
                                                         A//   -i
                    9
                       =
                         A~(B
                                - B')L        AA'"(I!-B')      J'

500                  Proceedings        of the Royal Society
 or
             (A'x   -   Ay)'   =   AA' (B'    -   B) (ABy      -  A'B'x)  .
    This, again,    is the equation      of a parabola,      which passes, like     the
others, through       the   origin,   but whose axis is no longer vertical.
    The converse suggests another easy but interesting problem.
    If we write £ for —
                           A
                              , 17 for^,A
                                            and/ and       /' for   the halves of I!
and B', we easily see that the last equation above becomes
                        ({  -r,,*=      lf—f( f'l          -fy).
 Every parabola passing through             the origin       may have its equation
put in this form.         Hence, as    £  and  r1 are dependent on one another
(in the   thermo-electric        as   in the projectile        case)   only  as being
both functions of temperature, or of time,              it is obvious that we must
seek to break      this expression up into a linear                relation   between
functions    of  £  and    17 separately.       A well known          transformation
leads to
                   J7*~i -            Jf-       *"
                                                   =  =*=  (/-/')•
whence
                              J'f -*=±(r-/),
                              Jf» - ,= ±(t -/'),
where   t is some function of time or of temperature.                   These give
                                   S  =  ri2/-      r).
                                   r, =  t (2/   - t)   .
Hence, in the thermo-electric case, if we obtain                a parabola by    using,
as ordinate and       abscissa,   the   simultaneous       indications    of   any  two
circuits whose junctions are at the same temperatures, and                    if one of
them gives a parabola (with axis vertical) in terms of absolute
temperature, t must be a linear function of the difference of absolute
temperatures of the junctions, and, therefore, the other circuit                  gives
a   similarly situated parabola in terms of                 the   absolute   tempera
ture.

these   1 now give but one, which, however, with that in the succeed
ing Note, is quite sufficient to show their general nature.
    Let P be any scalar function of p. It is required to find the
difference between the value of       P  at p, and its mean value through
out a very small sphere,      of radius r and volume        v,  which   has  the
extremity of     p as centre.
    From what is said above, it is easy to see that we have the
 following expression for the required result : —
 where o~is the vector     joining    the    centre of the sphere      with the
 element of volume dt, and the integration (which relates to              a~ and
 ch alone) extends through the whole volume of the sphere.                   Ex
 panding     the  exponential,    we may write        this expression in the
 form
  higher terms being omitted on account of the smallness of r, the
  limit of To-.
     Now, symmetry shows at once that
                                ffrds     = 0.
     Also, whatever constant vector       be  denoted by a,
                   M^y**          =  -   ati//(S<rUa)Vs.
     Since the integration extends throughout          a sphere,   it is obvious
  that the integral    on the    right  is   half of what      we may call the
   moment of inertia of the volume about         a diameter.     Hence
     If   wo now write   V for    a, as the integration does not refer to      V,

    By the preceding Note this may              be transformed into

 V depends on those of p.
    A still farther simplification             may be introduced       by using a
 vector   <rj , which is finally to be made zero, along with its corre
 sponding operator A0         , for the above expression then becomes
 where p appears        in a comparatively manageable form.             This is  the
 expression to which the title of the Note refers.                  It  is obvious
 that, so far, our formulae          are applicable   to any distribution.      We
 now restrict them to        a  superficial one.
    Integration     of this last form can always be easily effected in the
case   of  a  surface of revolution, the origin being a point in the axis.
 For the expression,        so far as the integration       is concerned,    can in
 that case be exhibited as a single integral

    In  a Preliminary Note,         read   before     this Society on the    31st of
May 1869 (see Proceedings), a number of experiments were de
scribed, which proved that the lethal action of certain doses of
physostigma can be prevented by the administration                     of  atropia.•
   * June 1871. — While this Abstract is passing through the press, the author
has received   a paper by M. Bourneville, in which the above result is satisfac
torily confirmed by experiments on guinea-pigs.

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                           507
Further, it      was pointed out, that antagonism between            any two sub
stances, in the sense of the lethal action of the one being preventible
by the physiological          action of the other, had not previously been
shown to exist by any certain and satisfactory evidence.                    In    the
various instances where experiment seemed to indicate the existence
of such    an antagonism, sufficient proof was not given that the dose
of the substance whose action appeared to be antagonised was certainly
a lethal one.        The conflicting      opinions and doubts this fallacy has
given origin to, have induced the author to follow                a plan whereby
it may     be completely avoided.
    In  the first place, the minimum fatal dose of physostigma for the
species of animal employed was accurately determined by a number
of preliminary experiments           ; so  that the weight of the animal being
ascertained, it was an easy matter to be certain of the dose that
could     kill it.     Then,    in those    experiments     where   an animal re
covered after the administration             of a dose  of atropia given in com
bination with a dose of physostigma, equal to or in excess of the
minimum          fatal, it was killed many days afterwards, and when the
effects   of the two     substances     had completely disappeared,       by a dose
of physostigma, equal to or less than that from which it had pre
 viously     recovered.       Therefore,    when the administration      of atropia
prevented an otherwise         fatal  dose  of  physostigma  from    causing death,
a perfect      demonstration      was obtained     of the power of atropia   to  pro
duce some physiological action or actions that counteracted some other
wise lethal action or actions of physostigma.
    In   the preliminary note referred to, it was suggested                that, as
 both atropia and physostigma are capable of producing a number
 of different actions,       several of which may not be mutually           antago
 nistic, and that, as both substances           are capable of producing several
 actions of    a  similar kind, considerably less potent to cause death than
 those by which their fatal effects are usually induced,              it would pro
 bably be found that         a region exists where the non-antagonised and
 the  similar actions       are present in sufficient degrees of activity to be
 themselves able         to   produce fatal results.       This anticipation      has
 proved     to be correct.        A large number of experiments          have been
 made, by which the region of the successful antagonism of fatal
 doses   of physostigma        has been defined with considerable exactness.
 The smallest and the largest doses of atropia that are able to pre

 vent death     after the administration         of different    fatal   doses    of
 physostigma, and the maximum fatal dose of physostigma that is
 capable of being rendered      non-fatal by atropia were ascertained, and
 it was found that beyond these various points death                may be pro
 duced    by combined doses of the two substances,              either by some
 non-antagonised action belonging to one or other of them, or by a
 combination of similar actions belonging to both.
     As  the   above   results could be obtained only by performing
 a   very large number of experiments, rabbits were the animals
 selected,  it being impossible     to obtain a sufficient number        of   dogs.
 or other convenient animal.          The weight of animal employed was,
 as  nearly as possible, three pounds      ; and     when   below or in excess
of this   a correction was made, so that each dose represented                three
 pounds weight of animal.
    In  one portion of this investigation,      experiments were performed
in whicb physostigma was given five minutes after atropia, both
substances     being injected under the skin.            In the first  series, the
dose    of physostigma      was   the   minimum       fatal, and the doses of
atropia ranged from one that was too small to prevent the lethal
action of this dose of physostigma, through a number of gradually
increasing doses of atropia that were able to prevent death, until a
dose was found whose         administration     resulted in death.        Similar
series of experiments were made with doses of physostigma one and
a-half times, twice, two and a-balf           times,    thrice, and three and
a-half times as large      as the  minimum fatal.         With   the minimum
fatal dose of physostigma, it was found that while                 -01   grain   of
atropia is too small to prevent death,            •015  grain is able to do so     ;
and    that with any dose ranging from           •015  grain to 5-2 grains the
lethal effect of this dose of physostigma may be prevented                ;  while
if  the dose of atropia   be 5 3   grains or more, the region of successful
antagonism is left, and death occurs.           With     one and a-half      times
the minimum       fatal dose of physostigma, successful antagonism was
produced     with   doses    of atropia ranging        from -02 grain to 4 2
grains;    with twice the minimum fatal of physostigma, with                 do>es
of atropia ranging from 025 grain to            3 2  grains; with two       and a-
half times the minimum fatal of physostigma, with doses of atropia
ranging from -035 grains to        2 2  grains;    with thrice the minimum
fatal of physostigma, with doses of atropia ranging from '06 grain



                         of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                               509
to 1-2     grain; and with three and a-half times the minimum fatal
dose      of physostigma, with doses of atropia ranging from '1 grain to
•2   grain.        Successful antagonism could not be obtained above this
dose, and, accordingly, three and             a-half times the minimum fatal
dose of physostigma would appear to be about the largest quantity
whose lethal            action may be prevented by administering                   atropia
five minutes previously.
     A similar      series of experiments       has been      made,   in which phy
sostigma was administered five minutes before                     atropia, and           the
results were essentially the same, excepting that the region of suc
cessful antagonism was found to be more limited.
     These     results      may be graphically          represented      by means         of
diagrams.           The diagram accompanying this abstract is                 a reduced
copy of one exhibited by the author to illustrate                  the series of ex
periments above described, in which                  atropia was administered five
minutes before physostigma.                The experiments that terminated in
death are marked by crosses,             and those that terminated in recovery
by dots, while the position assigned to each experiment is deter
mined by the doses of physostigma                    and   atropia, calculated, when
necessary, for three pounds weight of rabbit.                  The    doses   of atropia
increase according to the distance, in a horizontal                   direction, from
the perpendicular line forming the left margin of the diagram, and
the increase proceeds at the rate of one-tenth of a grain for each
subdivision         of the horizontal lines.           The   doses of physostigma
increase from           below upwards, the same             horizontal    line     always
representing          the same    dose    of physostigma.         The curved line,
a    b          the fatal experiments (crosses) from those which
         c, separates
terminated in recovery (dots), and, accordingly, it defines the region
of successful antagonism — a region further distinguished in the
diagram by the absence of shading.   The darkly shaded region is
that in which antagonism is not successful, death                     being produced
because       the doses of atropia given             in combination with           one    or
other of the doses of physostigma employed are either too small or
too large.          In the lightly   shaded   region, below the horizontal line
representing the minimum fatal dose of physostigma, the doses of
physostigma           are   too small    of themselves to        cause    death.      The
lateral extension of the diagram              is,   however, insufficient to exhibit
the      chief interest of this region.             Were the diagram extended,            it

510                 Proceedings of    the   Royal Society
 would show that fatal experiments occur in this region, not only
 with fatal doses of atropia given in combination with less than
 fatal doses of physostigma,        but also    with less than fatal doses
 of atropia given in combination with              less  than fatal doses of
physostigma.
    In  this manner, the entire superficial area of the region of suc
 cessful antagonism has been defined, when physostigma is given
 five  minutes     after and   five minutes       before atropia.      In  addi
tion    to this, what     may be termed the thickness            of the region
has    been   determined.      For this   purpose,     series  of experiments
were    made, in each of which the doses of physostigma                were  the
same,    and   the doses of atropia varied      ;   while with each dose of
atropia, several experiments were made which differed from each
other by a difference     in the interval of time between         the adminis
tration of the two substances.       From the data thus obtained, curves
have been constructed; the dose of physostigma serving as the
base-line, the various doses of atropia as the abscissae, and the dif
ferent intervals of time that separate        successful from unsuccessful
experiments as the summits of the ordinates.               When    these curves
are brought into relation with a diagram of the superficial area              of
the   region of successful antagonism, in such a manner that the
base-lines,    representing the doses of physostigma, correspond to
each other, and that the ordinates of these           curves   extend at right
angles to those in the diagram of the superficial             area, the lateral
extension of the region of successful antagonism may be defined.
In this    way, its lateral as well as its superficial        extent has been
indicated with atropia and physostigma.
    After defining the superficial area and the thickness of the
region of successful antagonism, it seemed of interest to ascertain
what dose of atropia is required to produce death with a dose of
physostigma      below the minimum         fatal.     The experiments       per
formed for this purpose show that when one-half of the minimum
fatal dose of physostigma is given five minutes after atropia, so
large a dose of the latter substance         as 9 8 grains is required        in
order to cause      death  ; recovery taking place with doses ranging
from    3 to 9'5  grains.
    The minimum fatal dose of sulphate of atropia given alone was
found to    be  twenty-one grains for    a  rabbit weighing three pounds.

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                                     511
It    is,   therefore, remarkable that the ,$7ths of             a   grain can prevent
a      of physostigma, equal to the minimum fatal, from causing
     dose
death, and that the j\;th. of grain    capable of rendering non
                                         a          is
fatal   a    dose   of physostigma, equal         to three and         a-half times the
minimum fatal.
  Excepting dilatation of the pupils, these minute doses of atropia,
and indeed any dose capable of antagonising the lethal action of
physostigma,          are   unable      to produce any symptom                recognisable
by    a     mere     inspection of the animal.              Still, they undoubtedly
produce energetic physiological                effects   — effects, however, which          it
is   unnecessary to describe in this brief abstract.                   It   is   sufficient to
point out that the notion, which exists in many quarters, that
rabbits can scarcely be affected by atropia                is   an erroneous one.
   Without referring to the other results obtained in his investiga
tion, the author pointed out, in conclusion, that unless the anta
gonism        between       any two active substances            be examined           in the
manner        indicated in this communication,               no satisfactory proof of
its existence        can be obtained.         The superficial      area    of the region
should       always be       defined,    otherwise       indications      of antagonism
obtained by one observer             will    be liable to be discredited            by those
who subsequently examine the subject.                       The first observer may
succeed in performing an experiment within the area of successful
antagonism, and thus feel satisfied of its existence                      ;   but his suc
cessors may fail in obtaining                any proof by so varying                the dose
of one or other substance as to pass the limits of the region of suc
cess (see diagram).           Feeling    assured that many examples of success
ful antagonism, besides the one he had the honour of bringing before
the Society, will yet be discovered, the author could not avoid the
conclusion          that the imperfect        methods of investigation              hitherto
pursued are accountable for the absence of success that has attended
the numerous           researches    made on this subject —          a   subject,    it   need
scarcely be added, of the greatest importance to toxicology and to
scientific therapeutic?.

                        Professor Allman, F.E.S.E.
                                     Abstract.
   In this communication           an    Actinozoon (Actinia) was compared
with  a Hydrozoon (Hydra), and the various Sub-orders of the Hydro-
zoa were compared        with one another.
   The author agreed with Agassiz in regarding the radiating cham
bers  of an   Actinia    as the homologues         of the radiating canals of a
medusa, but he differed from him as              to the true homologies of the
differentiated stomach-sac of Actinia ; for while Agassiz                  regards
this as represented        by the proboscis or hypostome of the Hydra
inverted into its body cavity, Professor Allman maintains that it is
impossible on this supposition to conceive of the structure of Actinia;
and on comparing a        Hydra with      an Actinia, he imagines the tentacle
to become     connate for a greater or less extent with the sides of
the hypostome and with one another, so that the hypostome of the
hydra, while retaining        its normal       position, will thus become the
stomach    of the Actinia, and will at the same time become connected
with the outer walls by a series of radiating             lamellae  — the connate
tentacle walls — separated from one another by radiating chambers,
the cavities of the tentacles        ;  while such portions of the tentacles
of Hydra    as  still continue    free   will  be represented    by a single circle
of the tentacles of Actinia.
    The author had formerly compared the radiating                    canals of    a
 hydroid   medusa      to  the immersed portions of the tentacles of               a
Hydra,    and he    still maintains this view.
    The strict parallelism of a siphonophore with                  a hydroid    was
pointed out,      and    each  of the zooids which combine to form              the
 heteromorphic siphonophorous colony was shown — as indeed Hux
 ley and others had already done          — to    have its representative    in the
 hydroid colony, and to be but a slightly modified form of                    some
 hydral zooid.
    In order     to   understand       the    relations  of a discophorous or
 steganophthalmic medusa           to the other hydroxoa,         he supposes the
 "utrium" of      a hydroid      medusa,      or that part    of  the  main   body
 ravity which is still immersed in the solid proximal portion of                the

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1870-71.                     513
umbella, at the base of the manubrium, to be expanded laterally,
and the gelatinous extoderm of its floor to be projected along four
or eight symmetrically      disposed radiating lines into as many    thick
pillars, which converge towards the axis, and there meet the manu
brium,    while   the thin   intervening    portions between    the pillars
become developed into generative pouches,          the velum at the same
time disappearing.      A hydroid     medusa would thus, in all essential
points, become converted into a discophorous medusa.
    A Lucernaria    was conceived    of by imagining   a Hydra  to have its
tentacles reduced to four in number, and expanded laterally until
their   sides meet and coalesce    ; while the hypostome continues free,
the solid hydrorhizal     basis becoming at the same time extended
into   a peduncle    of attachment traversed longitudinally by four
canal-like prolongations of the body cavity, or else by a simple
continuation    of this cavity.
   Lastly,   a Beroe was taken as a type       of the Ctenophora,  and was
conceived of as a hydroid medusa so modified as to become reduced
to the atrial region alone.       The two lateral canals which spring
from the somatic cavity in Beroe, and subdivide so as to form ulti
mately the eight meridional canals, correspond to the greatly deve
loped basal portion     of the radiating canals of the medusa, or that
portion of those     canals which is still contained within the solid
summit of the umbella;        the affinities of the Ctenophora being thus
directly with the Hydrozoa instead of the Actinozoa.
    The author finds the key to the homology of Beroe, and the tran
sition between the Ctenophora        and   the  Hydroida in the singular
 ambulatory gonophore of Clavatella.

A Marble Bust of the late Sir Roderick I. Murchison, Bart.,
                        by Weekes, was presented.
   Although      the Bust was only placed in the      Hall    at this time, the
offer  of it  to the Society was made       by Sir Roderick       1.  Murchison
in June 1871, in the following letter to the President             : —
                                      16 Belgrave Square,      26th  June 1871.
   My dear Professor, — As it is very improbable, indeed — nay,
almost a certainty      — that I  shall not be able to attend the meeting
of  the  British Association     at Edinburgh this year, I wish to send,
as my representative, a        marble bust of myself, executed by Mr
Henry Weekes, R.A., and which is on the point of completion.
   I  beg to be informed       if the Council of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh,       over which    you preside,    will   accept    this bust as a
donation from myself, in gratitude for the great honour they con
ferred on me many years ago, by enrolling            my name       in their dis
tinguished      list of honorary      members   ;  also    in   recollection    of
another great honour which they conferred on me, by granting                    to
me    the first     Brisbane   gold   medal for my labours in Scottish
geology.      If you   assent to this proposal,   I  will direct Mr Weekes
to transmit the bust to the Secretary of your Royal Society, in the
hope that you will place it in the same building as the busts of our
other scientific countrymen whom you have thus honoured.
    I  have   also   written to David     Milne Home       on this point, and
have assured him, at the same time, that           I  will  do everything       in
my power to support the memorial to the Government to assist the
Royal Society of Edinburgh          in carrying   out their meritorious       re
searches,    as signed by yourself.    — An early reply will oblige, yours
sincerely,
                                       RODERICK I. MURCHISON.
   To Professor Chkistison,
          President, R.S. Edin.

                     of Edinburgh. Session        1871   -72.                531
      Sir Robert Christison, Bart., the President, read the
                     following Opening Address : —
    At  the commencement         of this, the 89th     session   of  the   Royal
Society of Edinburgh,        I beg  to congratulate you on the successful
issue of that which      has  just come to an end.        The number of our
members has increased, in consequence             both of a low proportion
of  deaths among us, and likewise         of  an increase of new members
beyond     the average    ;  so that, from 326 at the same          period last
 year, the Society has grown to 331 at the present time.
    We may appeal with equal, and even more, satisfaction to the
 success of our late meetings ; which, in the first place, were carried
 on a full month longer than usual before exhausting the list of
 communications       approved by your Council as worthy of being read
 before you   ;  and which, in the second      place, attracted from first to
 last unusual attendance and interest, on the part both of ourselves
 and of our visitors, by reason       of the variety    and value    of the in
 quiries communicated at them.
    Nor, amidst    these   grounds of direct gratification      on account of
 the proceedings of last year in the Royal Society itself, will it
 appear out    of place that   I  further congratulate you on the great
 success  which     attended the late meeting         in Edinburgh of The
 British Association for the Advancement of Science. Whether we
 consider who was the founder of this most prosperous institution —
 or that the    Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Association were
established very much for the same objects — or that our Fellows
 have taken an active part in its proceedings, wheresoever               it may
 have held its meetings — or that our endeavours contributed greatly
to  bring it on the recent occasion to our        city — or that many of       us
did much, or at least as much as we could, to receive our eminent
guests with the cordiality due to their distinction           in science   — we
are equally entitled      to rejoice that,   in respect of the number of
remarkable men who were attracted hither, the excellence of the
matter produced before the several sections, the interest of the
excursions which the unrivalled          opportunities     in our neighbour
hood enabled us to offer, the oft-expressed obligations          of our guests
for the reception they met from us and our fellow-citizens,               and,  I

532              Proceedings   of the Royal Society
may add, the eight days of glorious weather, upon which in Scot
land much of the comfort of so great an assemblage            depends —
this forty-first meeting of the British Association   proved in truth
to be a great success.
   Although the deaths in the Society have not         been    numerous
during   last year, we have nevertheless      to lament     the loss of
several  of the most distinguished    among our Fellows, both ordi
nary and honorary.     From the list of ordinary Fellows we have to
strike out the names, in alphabetical order, of Dr William Anderson,
Mr Charles Babbage, Mr Robert Chambers, Dr Robert Daun, Mr
Alexander Keith Johnston, Dr Sheridan Muspratt, Mr Robert
Russell, Sir William Scott, Dr Fraser Thomson, and Mr Moses
Steven.      Our  honorary list no longer    bears  the names of Sir
John Herschell, Sir William Haidinger,       and  Sir Roderick Impey
Murchison.
    Mr Rorert Russell,    an eminent    practical and scientific agri
culturist in the county of Fife, was led to connect himself with the
Society by his taste for meteorological pursuits.
    Sir William Scott, Baronet, of Ancrum,     an enterprising country
gentleman, a soldier in his youth, and afterwards for some time
 member    of Parliament   for his county, was well known for his
attachment to scientific society, and for the regularity of his attend
ance at our meetings at a period when     his avocations allowed him
to reside occasionally in Edinburgh.
    Dr Rorert Daun, Deputy Inspector-General of Army Hospitals,
also a frequent attender at one time of the meetings of the Society,
died in June last at a very great age [86]. He served his country
with distinction in the medical service of the army throughout
 nearly the whole of the most momentous period, and the most
critical trials, in the military history of our country. He was
 highly esteemed publicly for his knowledge in all departments of
 his profession, and his powers of organisation in his own branch
of service ; and he was no less prized by his friends for his acquaint
ance with various branches of science and literature.

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                        533
    Dr Frasrr Thomson,        son   of  the Rev.   Dr William Thomson of
Perth, and nephew of the late eminent clergyman of Edinburgh,
Dr Andrew Thomson, the first minister of St George's parish,
graduated at the University of Edinburgh, where he had been a
distinguished student of medicine.            He settled as a medical prac
titioner in his native city, and for most of his life was much
engrossed     by the cares of an extensive practice in town and
country.     But, like many of his profession in our county towns,
he made natural history his recreation for his short leisure hours,
and applied       himself   eagerly    to microscopical    research in that
department of science.         In  this he acquired great expertness and
accuracy, and would easily have become an original inquirer, were
it not that his fondness for such pursuits had not fame for its
object, but simply relief from the cares and fatigues of professional
life.    He died, after   a short illness, in the month    of October,  in his
 65 th year.
    James Sheridan Muspratt, a native of Dublin, was trained in
 the science to which he dedicated his life, under two of the greatest
chemists of their day in Europe         — Graham    and Liebig.   At the   age
 of twenty-three     he published    the results of investigations     carried
 on as a student in Liebig's laboratory on the sulphites, showing
 their analogy with the        carbonates.     Returning to Giessen three
 years later, he resumed       his inquiries    into the sulphur acids, the
 fruit of which    was an interesting     paper on the Hyposulphites,      and
 also on Sulpho-cyanic      Ether.     In  the interval he did good service
 to practical chemistry in this country by making generally known
 in  a translation   Plattner's standard work on the Blowpipe        ; and in
 1854 he published a "Dictionary of Chemistry,"             which has been
 of great  use   in diffusing   a knowledge      of chemistry among      those
 engaged in      the practical     working    of chemical problems.         Mr
 Muspratt died in the 47th year of his age.
    Mr Rorert Chamrers, long          one  of the  most  attached and work
 ing Fellows of the Royal Society, is one of the many instances,
 observed at all times in Scotland, of men raising themselves in a
 short time, by the sheer unaided gifts of native talent and indomi
 table perseverance, from an obscure position in society to a promi

534                Proceedings     of the Royal Society
Hunt place    in public estimation.        Born, as we are told by one of
his biographers, who evidently knew him and his history well,                of
parents respectable, but not fortunate in life, he bad to struggle
in his early years with difficulties.        Nevertheless he was not pre
vented from reaping the inestimable advantages               which in Edin
burgh a parent of even moderate             means    could always command,
for a son of promising        parts,   from an      education at the High
School.
   Like other prolific writers, Mr Chambers began the career of
authorship at a very early age.            He must have been not above
eighteen, when, having not long before            chosen for his occupation
in life that of bookseller, he determined to be publisher and author
too, projecting    and conducting     a periodical     called the " Kaleido
scope," to which he himself also contributed articles from his own
pen.    Soon afterwards he published
                                            " Illustrations of the Author of
              "
Waverley    ;    and in 1823, when only twenty years old, he added
the work by which he has been longest and most familiarly known
as a writer,     his " Traditions    of Edinburgh."         Work upon work
then followed in quick succession         on all sorts   of literary subjects,
but chiefly historical    and antiquarian       — works which it would      be
out of place even to enumerate in so short a sketch as that to which
this brief notice must be confined.
   At last, in conjunction with his elder brother, Mr William
Chambers, was begun in 1832 the now famous " Chambers' Edin
burgh Journal,"     — the first idea, and as such a great invention,        of
a weekly periodical devoted       to short productions, original, as well
as critical, on nearly all literary and also some scientific subjects,
suited for the information, as well as for the purse, not alone of
the educated classes ordinarily so called, but likewise for the edu
cated   in the humbler walks of life.           This undertaking     met soon
with extraordinary      success  — in   so much, indeed, that       it became
the parent    of many others identical or similar in their aims, and
not a few of them not less prosperous than that of the two brothers
Chambers.
   While adhering steadily to his literary tastes, and giving forth
in various works the results of his literary labours, Mr R. Chambers'
attention was turned to a totally different object of study, which
in all probability he first followed as a diversion, or distraction

                   of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                         535
from the severity of professional toil. This was geology, which in
the end captivated him, and first made him an active, energetic
member of this Society.         Cultivating his     new   pursuit  with    his
inherent fervour unabated, he soon became           an  original inquirer in
this fascinating branch of natural science.          Besides making      him
self acquainted with the rock structure of many parts of his own
country,    he visited   as a geologist  Switzerland,     Norway,   Sweden,
 Iceland,   the Faroe Islands, and parts of Canada and the United
 States.    Few geological amateurs, engaged in        a profession usually
so   engrossing as that of Robert Chambers,            have  acquired    such
 intimate knowledge of geology.        Many of    us can recall the interest
 of his discussion of geological questions at our ordinary meetings;
           " Ancient                "
 and his              Sea  Margins    will long   be known    as one  of   the
 earliest, most exact, and most lively descriptions of that particular
 branch of his favourite study.
    Mr Chambers     was distinguished,   alike in his public appearances,
 as in social intercourse, by a great fund        of information    on most
diversified topics of interest in literature and science, by his
caution and politeness in criticism, and by his courteous kindliness
in every relation of life. In the last respect he will be long missed
by a numerous circle of attached friends, many of whom were his
fellow-members      of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.            In March
 1871, after a   tedious and enfeebling illness, borne with singular
 patience, he died in the 69th year of his age.
    I turn   next to another no less serious loss sustained during the
 past year by science and this Society in the death       of Mr Alexander
Keith Johnston.        Mr Keith Johnston      at first intended to  join the
medical profession     ; but, at an early age, he betook himself       to the
art of engraving, which again led him to the study of geography               ;
and from that time geography became            his ruling pursuit, and the
object of his professional life.
    In  1830,  having had occasion, during        a  pedestrian trip in the
Highlands, to remark the inaccuracy of          the maps    of Scotland, he
published an improved collection        in a Guide Book.       At  the same
time, to facilitate the development of his geographical enterprises,
he   joined the firm of his two brothers, Sir William and Thomas
Johnston, which had been established in this city some years

536                Proceedings     of  the  Royal Society
before for carrying     on the business of engraving and printing, in
which    they have been long famous among the skilful engravers of
Edinburgh.       In his thirty-ninth year      he attracted the regard   of
scientific geographers at large by the publication of his "National
Atlas," and still more, five years later, by his "Atlas of Physical
Geography,"       For the task he had thus set himself he had been
thoroughly prepared by assiduous study of the best works in the
various languages of Europe, by frequent visits to many European
countries, and by acquaintance and personal intercourse with the
greatest continental     geographers and travellers.       Not long after
wards   Mr Keith Johnston brought out in succession a " Dictionary
of Geography," a "Military Atlas" for Alison's "History of
Europe,"    the " Royal    Atlas of Modern       Geography,"    and subse
quently a variety of cheap atlases for the use of schools.        By  these
productions     he raised himself     to a position in which he had no
superior rival as a geographer in this country          ; and his merit in
this respect received the stamp of the Royal Geographical Society
of London in the last year of his life by the award of the Geo
graphical Victoria Medal.
   But Mr Johnston took also great interest in almost every branch
of physical research, with many of which         he had no mean acquaint
ance, and whose cultivation       in this city he seized every opportunity
to encourage and promote.           Among other obligations to him, we
are greatly indebted for the foundation of " The Meteorological
          "
Society     of Scotland, — an institution which, under the able direc
tion of its present Secretary, promises important results, certain,
indeed, to be realised     if  the Society receive due public support in
the line of inquiry in which        it has already   been  for some years
successfully engaged.       It  is also known to me that the city and
University    are mainly indebted to him for the early foundation of
the Chair of Geology, through the munificence of his friend the
late Sir Roderick Murchison.          At the direct instance of Mr John
ston, and through      the weight which his genuine love of science
commanded with many men of influence, Sir Roderick was induced
 to alter his intentions, from a       " post-obit " foundation, to an  im
mediate gift, of the Chair, in conjunction with a Royal Foundation
 and additional endowment.
    In  such proceedings as these          Mr Johnston did   good  with  no

ulterior view, and from       no love   of being what our neighbours      across
the channel aptly call a "grand faiseur."             Hence we scarcely know
how much we owe to him.              His extensive acquaintance with the
upper ranks of what it has        become the custom to call the
                                                                       " citizen
      "
class     in Edinburgh, enabled him often quietly to direct public
opinion in the nice exercise of scientific, literary, and professional
patronage, when sound direction             was    greatly needed;      and his
acknowledged prudence, probity,            impartiality,    and knowledge of
men, never failed to guide himself soundly in such conjunctures.
   Throughout       his whole life he was faithful and fruitful in his
calling, and no       less a sincere   and active Christian.       Seldom has
there been a more affable, agreeable,           and profitable companion in
social life in all its phases.
   Although far from being          a young      man   at his death,  — for   he
died in his 67th year, — we          have    to lament    that he was struck
down while in full possession of his powerful intellect, and enjoy
ing shortly before        a vigour which      promised long continuance        of
his useful labours.
   Wilhelm Eitter von Haidinqeh,              one   of our Honorary Fellows,
was a favourite      pupil of Mohs; who, during great part of the first
half of this century, was celebrated as one of the foremost mineralo
gists of his day in Europe, and as the able Professor of Mineralogy
in the University of Vienna.            While yet     a young man,     William
Haidinger      possessed    an   extraordinary      extent   and accuracy      of
knowledge of minerals.          On account of his talents as a descriptive
mineralogist,      he came     to Edinburgh, about the year 1824,              to
arrange and catalogue the splendid mineralogical collection                 of  a
former curator of our Society,         Mr Thomas Allan, banker in this
city,— a collection unrivalled,        for extent and careful costly selec
tion, among the private mineralogical              museums     of Europe.     In
discharging      this duty    Mr Haidinger        was   enabled to establish
several species as new to science        ;  which he investigated and com
municated to our meetings in conjunction with the late Edward
Turner,     the chemist, at the time lecturer here, and soon after
wards    first Professor of Chemistry in University College, London.
Haidinger took the descriptive,            Turner the analytical,       part of
these   inquiries;     and, in both respects,     their papers   are models    of
   vol. vn.                                                          4 c

538              Proceedings      of the Royal Society
mineralogical    investigation.     I   was at this time intimately ac
quainted with Haidinger,       and could well appreciate his mineralo
gical facility and acutenese, his varied knowledge of natural history
and physical science, and his remarkable command              of languages. —
so that, for example,      in our own tongue,        he  could tell a jocular
story, make a pun, and extemporise a clever couplet, — which                  I
take to  be about the severest of all tests of a man's familiarity with
a foreign language.
   No one who knew him           at   that time      could fail to see that
Haidinger would one day become a man of mark among the
mineralogists of his own land, to which he returned soon after
completing    his labours in    Mr Allan's museum. He then travelled
for some time with      Mr Allan's son, Robert, who died a few years
ago a  Fellow of this Society ;     and the main object of the travellers
 was the pursuit of mineralogy.        Ere long Mohs died, and Haidinger
succeeded him in his University Chair.              His office put him natu
rally at the head of all relative Government undertakings, which
in their turn brought him promotion,            till at length he filled the
highest office in his profession, that of Director of the Mineralo
gical and G-eological Survey of Austria.            For his many scientific
and practical services to his country he received from his sovereign
the honour of knighthood       a few years before his death, which took
place last April in,  as  I understand,    the 71st year of his age.
   Coming nearer home,       I have next    to deal with the scientific life
of another lost Honorary Fellow of the highest rank in Physical
Philosophy,    Sir Roderick Impet Murchison, Baronet.                     But
though very willing, and not altogether unable, to do justice to
his remarkable labours in his science,       I felt  that I should   be acting
with injustice   to his memory, and to the claims           of  a far superior
biographer and eulogist,      if I did   not transfer from myself to      Pro
fessor Geikie the pleasing task of recalling to our recollection the
main points in the life and the work of his patron and friend.
The following summary is accordingly the tribute which Professor
Geikie has kindly enabled the Society to pay to the fame of Sir
Roderick Murchison      : —
   " Among our recent       losses  there is none which we have more
reason to deplore than his.       The name of Sir Roderick Murchison

                    of Edinburgh,     Session 1871-72.                    539
has been a household word in geology for nearly half a century,
not in Britain only, but also over all the world. While we share
in the wide regret at the injury which the general cause of science
sustained by his removal, we add also the sadness which arises from
the recollection of the relation which he bore to the progress of
geology in Scotland, and from what he has recently done for the
advancement of its study in the University of this city.
    " Born in   1792 at Tavadale,    in Ross-shire,    he was educated     for
the military profession, and served during part of the Peninsular
War.     But   on the arrival   of peace   in  1815, finding that the army
 no longer    opened    up the same prospect of activity for which he
 longed,   he   gave up his      commission,      married,  and   settled in
 England.      The succeeding part of his life, prior to 1824, he used
 to speak of as his "Fox-hunting period," when he threw himself
 with all the ardour of his nature into the field sports of a country
 residence.    Part of that period, however,      he spent abroad,  making,
with his wife, tours in      search of picture galleries and old art, and
keeping an elaborate diary, with criticisms on the character           of the
 fine arts in each tour or collection        visited.   It was by a kind of
 happy accident      that his energies were at last directed into the
channel of science, — the merit of which change was due partly to
 his wife's taste for natural      history,   and partly to the friendly
 counsel of Sir Humphrey       Davy.     He joined the Geological Society
 of London, and soon became one         of its most enthusiastic members.
 From that time forward his love for geology, and his activity in
 its pursuit, never waned. He travelled over every part of Britain,
and year after year he resorted to the Continent, traversing it in
detail from the Alps to Scandinavia, and from the coasts of France
to the far bounds of the Ural Mountains.            As the result of    these
journeys, there came from his pen more than a hundred memoirs,
                                                    '
besides two separate and classical works on           The Silurian System,'
         '
and on     Russia.'
    "Sir   Roderick    was essentially    a geologist,   and he chose     one
special branch    as   his own domain.      Perhaps no man ever had the
same    power, — which     seemed   sometimes almost an intuition, — of
seizing the dominant features of the geographical and palaeontolo-
gical details of a district.    With   a keen eye to detect the characters
as they rose before him, and a faculty        of rapidly appreciating their

540                 Proceedings of      the    Royal Society
significance, he could, as it were, read off the geology of a country
after a few traverses only,          when most men              would    have been
puzzling over their first section.        This    was the secret        of his   broad
generalisations regarding the geological structure of a large part of
Europe, — generalisations       which, though of course            requiring to     be
corrected and modified by subsequent more detailed investigations,
still remain true in the main, and still astound by their marvellous
grasp and suggestiveness. The leading idea of his scientific life
was to establish the order of succession           among rocks, and through
that order to show the successive             in the history of life on
                                              stages
our globe.       With the more speculativeparts of geology he meddled
little ; nor did he ever travel outside the bounds of his own science.
He early recognised the limits within which his powers could find
the fullest and most free development, and he was seldom found
making even a short excursion beyond them.
     " The special part of his work            chief title to fame
                                              on which his
rests is undoubtedly his establishment of 'The Silurian System.'
Before his time, the early chapters of the history of life on our
globe had been but dimly deciphered.              William Smith had          thrown
a new flood of      light upon that history by showing the order of               suc
cession among the secondary rocks of England, and had done more
than    any other man to dispel           the prejudices         with    which     the
doctrines of Werner seemed           naturally to fill the mind.            But    the
rocks older than secondary, to which Werner had given the name of
'
    Transition,' remained still in        deep    Wernerian        darkness.       Sir
Roderick Murchison        saw that    it might     be possible to        bring   order
and light out of these rocks, even as had been done with those of
more recent origin;        and that a double interest would attach                  to
them    if,   as he supposed,   they should reveal           to us the first begin
nings of life upon our globe.           Choosing       a   part of the broken land
of England where        the   rocks are well exposed,           he set   himself    to
unravel their order of succession.             Patiently year after year            he
laboured at his        self-appointed    task, communicating             his results
sometimes in writing to his friends, sometimes in the form of                        a
short paper to the Geological Society of London, until at last,                     in
1838, he gathered up the whole into his great work,    The Silurian'
System.'       In
             that  book the early chapters of the history of life on
the earth were first unfolded, and    system of classification tu
                                              a

                 of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                     541
chosen with     such skill that it has been found applicable,       with
minor modifications, even in the most distant quarters of the globe.
    "Round this early work all his after-labours seemed to range
themselves by a natural sequence.        His choice had led him into
the most ancient fossiliferous rocks, and to that first love he re
mained true.     Whether in the glades of Shropshire, or the glens
of his own Highlands, among the fjelds and fjords of Norway, or
in the wilds of the Urals, it was with the Palaeozoic formations
that he mainly busied himself.       They were to him a kind of patri
mony which had claims on his constant supervision.             With his
friend Sedgwick he unravelled      the structure of the middle Palae
ozoic rocks of Devonshire,    and with Keyserling and De Verneuil
he    showed  the true relations    of the upper Palaeozoic rocks of
Russia.    The Silurian, Devonian, and Permian systems, represent
ing each a vast cycle in the history of our earth as a habitable
globe, received in this way from him their first clear elucidation,
and the very names by which they are now universally known.
    " But if we seek  to measure    the influence which   Sir Roderick
Murchison    exercised on the progress of the science      of the time
merely by the original work which he himself          accomplished, we
should fail duly to appreciate the measure      and the power of that
influence, and the extent of the loss which his death      has caused.
Fortunate in the possession   of wealth and high social position,     he
was enabled   to act as a constant friend and guardian to the cause
of science. He moved about as one of the representative scientific
men of his day. To no man more than to him do we owe the public
recognition of the claims of scientific culture in this country.    For
be not only stood out as the acknowledged chief in his own domain,
but had also the faculty of gathering round him men of all sciences,
among whom his kindliness        of nature, his courteous dignity of
manners, his tact and knowledge of the world, and his wide range
of social connections    marked him out as spokesman and leader.
Nowhere were these features of his character and influence more
conspicuous than in his conduct of the affairs of the Geographical
Society, of which he was for many years the very life and soul,
and which owes in large measure to him the stimulus it has given
to geographical science.
    "Here in his own native country, and       more  especially here in

  542               Proceedings   of the Royal Society
 Edinburgh,    we have peculiar    cause    to mourn the loss of such a
 man.     Though his residence from boyhood           had   been   chiefly  in
 London, he never to the last relinquished         his enthusiastic    regard
 for the land of his birth.    He never lost   an opportunity    of boasting
 that he was a Scot.      During the last ten years of his life he made
 frequent and protracted tours in the Highlands ; and, in unravel
 ling their complicated geological structure, he accomplished one
 of the most brilliant generalisations of his long and illustrious
 scientific  career.   There  is something touching       in the reflection
 that, after having travelled and toiled all over Europe, gaining the
 highest position and rewards which a scientific man can attain, he
 should at last, ripe in years and in honours, have come back to his
 own Highlands,      and there completed his life-work by bringing into
 order the chaos of the primary rocks, and laying such           an impress
 on Scottish    geology as had never been       laid before by any single
 observer.    For these and other      researches he received from this
 Society the first Brisbane Medal     —  an honour conferred on him at
 the Aberdeen meeting of the British Association, and of which he
 often spoke as one that gave him the deepest; gratification.              He
 used to boast, too, of being an honorary Fellow of this Society, and
 to quote a remark made to him by the late Robert          Brown, that his
 election into the list of our honorary Fellows was     one of the highest
 marks of distinction    he could receive.     His kindly interest in our
prosperity was often expressed      ; and   we have a token of it in the
presentation to us of his bust by Weekes, which this evening                is
formally delivered to the Society.
    "Of the closing    acts of his life, there is one which cannot be
mentioned without peculiar pride — the institution of a Chair of
G-eology and Mineralogy in the University of Edinburgh.                    He
intended to found this Chair by bequest; but on the retirement of
Dr Allman from the Chair of Natural History, he determined to
do   in his lifetime what would otherwise have been accomplished
not   till after his death.    He gave to the University          a  sum of
£6000;     and the Crown    having consented to add an annual grant
of £200, the Chair was founded in the spring of the present year.
Sir Roderick has not lived to witness the first beginnings of the
tuition which he had started.        But long after the memory of his
personal character shall fade, men -will remember the work which

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                         543
lie did ; they will recognise the impetus his researches have given
to geology all over the world; and let us hope also they will see
in the Chair he has founded the starting-point of a new and active
school of Scottish geology."
    I  have left to the last in this biographical       sketch of our lately
 deceased    Fellows two of the most eminent men of British science
 in their day — Herschel and Babbage. For as I could not pretend
 to do justice to the lives of men whose pursuits, in the highest
 range of physical science,       were   so far removed     from my own,      I
 think it right to keep quite apart the following eulogium, the
 preparation of which my university colleague, Professor Tait, has
 kindly allowed    me to impose     on him, and which      I  will give in his
 own words: —
    " Of Sir John F. W. Herschel           and Charles Babbage, who may
 be  fitly mentioned together, it is not       necessary  that much should
 be said, as their contributions     to science cannot fail to be set forth
 at length    in the Proceedings      of other Societies, with which they
 were more     connected than with our own. Intimate friends during
 their undergraduate career at Cambridge, they joined us as ordi
 nary Fellows shortly after taking their degrees, and when they
 were    just commencing, along with the late Dean Peacock, what
 all must consider, in spite of their other grand contributions to
science, the greatest work of their lives — the restoration of mathe
 matical    science in Britain.      It  is impossible even now to over
estimate the value of this service.           Few know to what      a state  of
ignorance we had        fallen   at the time when Lagrange,           Laplace,
 Fourier,    Cauchy, Poisson, and Gauss, and many others abroad,
were advancing with breathless rapidity          in the track, neglected by
us,   of James Bernoulli     and  Euler.     Partly from  a mistaken notion
that they were honouring          Newton     by adhering to his published
methods, partly owing to the British dislike to men and things
foreign, which at this time was pushed, perhaps not unnaturally,
to extreme lengths in all matters, and partly in consequence of our
long state of war with France, our mathematicians had never even
learned those unpublished methods by which Newton made his
discoveries, which,     us  soon   as they were     to some    extent divined

544                 Proceedings       of the Royal Society
abroad,    were   at ouce estimated at their true value, and pursued
with zeal and genius.*
    " Little
             by little, first by translating Lacroix's elementary treatise
on the differential and integral          calculus, and by thus introducing,
in face of determined opposition, the notation of differential                co
efficients into Cambridge,         so as for the first time to enable her
mathematicians        to understand       a   foreign  treatise;  secondly,    by
publishing     an excellent      collection    of examples;    and thirdly, by
their separate original treatises on different special parts of analysis,
they put this country on a level with France              and Germany, so far
at least as opportunities of progress are concerned.             It  is to them
mainly that       we   owe,   not merely our modern British school of
mathematicians,        which    is now certainly      second   to none in the
world, but even the very possibility of the existence in this country
of such great departed masters as Boole and Hamilton.

as a supplement to the translation           of Lacroix, is one of the most
charming      mathematical       works ever written, everywhere showing
   • Professor Tait has urged me to make known a reminiscence of my yonth
that at the time here referred to there were in Edinburgh, and in this Society,
no fewer than three mathematical amateurs, who, though they never made
themselves publicly felt as such, in some measure saved this corner of the
land from the censure dealt in the text. These were Sir William Miller,
Baronet, of Glenlee, better known as Lord Glenlee of the Scottish bench ;
William Archibald Cadell, of the family of Cadoll of Grange, who finished
his earthly career but a few years ago ; and my own father, Professor of
Latin in our University.         Lord Glenlee, a man of very retiring habits
and disposition, was usually called the first amateur mathematician             in
Scotland. Mr Cadell, also a man of great reserve and shyness, neverthe
less, in order to carry out his admiration of the modern continental mathe
matics, contrived to obtain, during the very hottest of our struggles with
France, from that generally unyielding potentate, the First Napoleon, per
mission, through the influence of one of the great mathematicians of Paris,

the last ten years of his life, which ended in 1820, betook himself, as his idea

to Newton, Bernoulli, Euler, Lagrange, Laplace, Lacroix, &c., whose works
were always at hand when not in his hands.         As he made a vigorous attempt
to indoctrinate me at a very early age in his favourite pursuits,     I know well

 '
     calculus of functions,' a strangely weird branch of analysis, which
remains even now much as Babbage left it.                 That in this direction
 there is    a splendid field open for the inquirer, is evident to any one
 who consults Babbage's papers           on it  ;   and  it is wonderful that it
 has not been greatly developed of late years, when so many mathe
 maticians, especially at home, have been found to apply themselves
 almost exclusively to those branches of the science which seem the
 least likely ever to have useful applications.
      "In   their after-life    the careers    of these great workers and
 thinkers led them widely apart.           Herschel devoted himself mainly
  to astronomy, but also to chemistry, photography, and occasionally
  to mathematics.        His astronomical work is all of the very highest
  class, whether      it consisted in his seclusion, for           several   of the
  best years of his life, at the Cape     of Good Hope in the       close observa

scientific men that in his hands the astounding problem of con

of the Treasury prevented the completion of the first engine, and
made     it obvious to Babbage that there          was no hope      of assistance
from Government to construct the second.                Yet it  has been allowed
by the best authorities that the money spent on the finished por
tion     of the difference-engine        was   far more     than repaid    to the
country by the extraordinary improvement in tools of every kind,
which was required for the new engine, and was at once supplied
by the fertile, inventive brain of Babbage as the work proceeded.

                   Observations   on the Fresh Waters     of Scotland.
      Looking around me for         some general theme suitable for the sub
ject of this introductory            address,   I   became    oppressed     with the
persuasion,        that no such subject, worthy of your acceptance,               had
been left unexhausted by the able men who have lately had to treat
 of scientific topics of a general nature in circumstances akin to my
 own on the present occasion.                                     I
                                          I therefore thought might trust to
 your indulgence,         and substitute for a general address          a notice    of
 some      inquiries, which    have been carried on from time to time dur
 ing my late occasional autumn holidays,              and which promise results
 of some interest, illustrating the hydrography of the fresh waters
 of Scotland.         These inquiries have in several respects been pushed
 not so far as to satisfy me completely.              But  as  I may not be able
 to    carry them through according to my present design, and                  I hope
  that others may be led to interest themselves in also pursuing them,
  I   beg to submit the results to the Society, such as they are.
       The topics I propose now to bring forward, — which are rather
  diverse in nature, yet not altogether unconnected with one another,
  — are three in number, — First, The composition of the water of
   certain lakes and their leading streams in Scotland, and the changes
   their waters undergo in the streams which the lakes feed              ;  Secondly,
   The temperature of         these   lakes at various depths;        and,   Thirdly,
   The action of their waters upon lead.
       I  shall commence by recalling shortly the geological structure of
   our country, by which in a great measure the nature of its waters
   is regulated.
        In theVpriraitive      formations     which    constitute   the    " Scottish
                  " of                       — for in correct language many
    Highlands            ordinary   speech,
   parts    of the so-called " Lowlands "      are as well entitled to the other
    name, — we find that the mountain            summits are either pointed or
    rounded,    but seldom table-topped;        that their spurs are commonly
    rather sharply ridged;        that their    surface abounds in precipices,
    crags, loose blocks, rocks, and stones        ; and that the valleys between
    them, except in the course       of our largest rivers,  are narrow, gravelly,
    or rocky,     thinly   covered   with    vegetative   soil, and consequently
    little fit for plough cultivation.         Not infrequently,      however, the
    spurs    or buttresses,    instead of being ridgy, are broad            and   flat,

548               Proceedings of         the  Royal Society
smoothly covered with fine heather, the favourite                breeding-place
for grouse, and tolerably dry, except where small patches of peaty
bog show themselves here and there.               This structure is often well
exemplified among the mountains of Glen-Shee.                  Again, when the
spurs of a mountain are ridgy, the ridges are sometimes                 separated
from one another by an upland valley, often very grassy, especially
towards its head or " corrie," but likewise apt in many places to be
boggy, and there abounding in peat, and in denuding cuts                    which
expose the peat to atmospheric influences.              Good examples of such
upland valleys are to be seen on the               Cobbler, and on its      higher
northern neighbour Ben-Arnen, where they face Arrochar eastward,
and also on    Ben-Lomond northward from its peak.                 Exposed peat
constitutes on the whole no great proportion of the surface                of most
mountains in the Highlands.
    It follows from this structure, that in most districts of the           High
lands rain and melted snow find little to            dissolve in descending the
mountain sides     ;  and their steepness       causes   the streams to tarry a
very short time in their descent, and to drain off quickly the excess
of water in flood-time.         All  these circumstances combine to         render
 the streams and lakes of the Highlands uncommonly pure in#dry
 weather, and not materially less so even in heavy floods.                 Among
 the granite ranges, such as in the Goat- Fell district of Arran, the
 streams, such as the Rosa and Sannox, are beautifully clear
 and colourless in the highest floods. The temporary water-falls
 which then streak the mountain              slopes,   present to the eye the
 purest whiteness; and on filling a glass tumbler from a stream, the
 water, after the instant subsidence of a few coarse particles of granite
 sand, is seen to be perfectly transparent and free from colour.                 In
 the mica-slate      districts   of the near Grampians the            streams   are
 equally    pure in    dry   weather.       But after rains they       are  visibly
 brownish, yet so     slightly t hat in   a common water-bottle on a dinner-
 table the colour may readily escape notice.
     During last autumn        I had frequent opportunities of examining,
 in various circumstances,          the water of one of these           mica-slate
 streamlets, which is used for supplying a villa near Loch-Goil-head.
 The   stream   descends     the steep eastern slope of       " The Cruach,"       a
 hill which land-locks      the upper part      of Loch Goil    on its west shore
 at  a point about a mile and a half from the Head.               Although only

2000      feet high,    " The Cruach "                 an   imposing,    rugged,
                                             presents
conical sky-line to      one entering     Loch Goil from Loch Long.          The
east face, precipitous at the summit, is entirely grassy lower down,
unless     where broken by other precipices, out-cropping             rocks, or
stream-courses, also always rocky.             There is little peat to be seen
anywhere, and no agriculture.              From various trials around Loch
Goil    and   Loch Lomond I am satisfied that this streamlet is a fair
type, both in its ordinary state and in its occasional variations, of
most of the streams which tumble into these sheets of water from
the mica-slate mountains around them.
     When I examined this water in the end of September, after ten
 days of perfectly dry weather, following a heavy twelve-hours' rain
 two days earlier, it was beautifully           clear and sparkling.      In   the
 first place, it  was entirely free from colour.        The absence of colour
 was tested conveniently and delicately by means of a glass tube 16
 inches long and six -tenths of an inch in diameter, which is nearly
 filled with the water        to be examined, and is held over,          but not
 touching, a sheet of white paper in a bright light.            For security,    a
 very fine colourless spring water was always kept at hand for com
 parison in another tube.          The slightest coloration is thus       seen by
 looking perpendicularly down the tube. Or it may be equally recog
  nised by looking at the surface of the water obliquely through the
 upper part of the tube from a distance of 18 inches or          2 feet ;  for the
  colour is thrown up by the paper, and concentrated, as it were, on
  the surface of the water, though the long subjacent column, as seen
  through     the glass, appears       colourless.    Very few waters, except
  that of springs, withstand altogether this test of the presence of
  colour.*     Mr Dewar has suggested that it admits of being made a
  water-chromometer, by employing             for comparison, — distilled water
  being used for fixing the zero point, — a solution of some invariable
  strength of a permanent per-oxide salt of iron, such as the acetate,
  and diluting the solution to uniformity of depth of colour with the
  water to be compared. The amount of dilution would denote the
  degree    of coloration relatively to     a fixed standard.
      In  the second    place, this water contained a very small propor-
     •  This  method,  devised for the occasion, I have since found to be a mere
   variety, but more  convenient,  of one proposed some years ago by Dr Letheby,
  and adopted by the late    Professor Miller.

550                   Proceedings       of the Royal Society
tion of saline matter.          In by far the greater number of streams              and
lakes in Scotland, whether Highland or Lowland, the salts met
with are        the same, viz., carbonates and             sulphates of the three
bases, lime, magnesia,         and soda, and the chloride         of their metalloids,
calcium,       magnesium,       and   sodium.       Of    these     the  chlorides    are
usually most abundant, the sulphates least so                    ;  and  of the    bases,
lime is commonly predominant, magnesia the contrary.                           But fre
quently in the Highland streams the proportion                      of all is so small
that most of the ordinary             liquid   tests   scarcely affect      them.      In
the water now         under consideration, for example, magnesia, among
the bases, was not indicated by the alkaline phosphate of ammonia ;
nor was sulphuric acid, among the acids, by nitrate of baryta;
even     lime      was   doubtfully      indicated     by   oxalate of ammonia            ;
chlorine, too, was scarcely indicated by nitrate of silver in                  a   small
test-glass, and        required a quantity          amounting         to six or seven
ounces      to yield an      undoubted faint mist; and permanganate of
potash     did not denote       organic matter except faintly.              Acetate of
lead,   however, by acting           on    both combined           carbonic   acid   and
organic matter, showed             a haze    even    in a small quantity         of the
water; and so did tincture of potash-soap, by virtue of the decom
 posing influence on it of earthy carbonates                 and free carbonic acid
 together.
    After frequent trials        I  am inclined to think, that for practical
 purposes,      when   organic    matter    does not require to be taken into
 account, we seldom need any other test for ascertaining the relative
 purity and usefulness of these waters than the late Professor Clark's
 soap-test.       In the present instance this denoted in several trials
 only 1'04      degrees of hardness, which is equivalent to that much of
 carbonate of lime in an imperial gallon of 70,000 grains of water.
 From frequent observation of the effects of this and other liquid
 tests, I   feel assured      that the total solid contents could not have
 been more than a 25,000th of the water, and was probably nearer a
 30,000th.
     In  the     third  place, this composition, viz.,        little saline and ex
 tremely     little  organic matter,     would   lead  to the expectation that the
 water will corrode lead.           And so it does, but not powerfully.                 A
 thin plate of lead, with 4J square inches of surface, weighing 437
   rains, was suspended        by  a lead rod    in this water.        In twenty-eight

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                       551
days it lost only 0-42 grain in weight, and crystals of carbonate of
lead were deposited scantily.            In  circumstances exactly the same,
distilled water will form carbonate of lead in abundance,               and  the
loss of lead is 3 4 grains, or eight times as much.
    In  times of flood the condition of the water in such streamlets
necessarily undergoes change.             But the difference is not so great
 *s might naturally be expected. In the night of 19th September
 last and subsequent morning rain fell steadily at Loch Goil, and
 heavily for twelve hours;           and,  consequently,    in the forenoon of
 the 20th the streamlet described above was considerably                flooded.
 The    water,   seen     in bulk,  was   somewhat brownish      ; it was even
 faintly brownish in a dining-room water-bottle;             and in a 16-inch
 glass tube it appeared yellowish.               Nevertheless, it looked well
 enough    in  a glass     tumbler,  and  it was   not in the slightest degree
 turbid.     Its purity, apart from its colour, was very great. No
 liquid test for inorganic salts but one, — not oxalate of ammonia,
  not nitrate of silver, not even acetate of lead, had any visible effect.
  The soap-test alone exerted any manifest action ; and this indicated
  only 0-8 degrees of hardness, which is equivalent to little more
  than an 80,000th of carbonate of lime in the water.                  In  corre
  spondence with this condition, lead underwent rapid corrosion in it.
  A  plate, an inch      and a  half  square, lost  in twenty-eight   days 3 09
  grains   in weight, or      about ^Jths of the loss in distilled water in
  the same time       ;  and crystals of carbonate of lead were formed in
  abundance.
     I examined the same stream on a previous occasion after a furi
  ous tempest     and rain-flood on the 24th August last.            Much    rain
  had fallen at Loch Goil previously for several days.              But   on the
  24th it fell in torrents, and for half-an-hour that forenoon like a
  tropical deluge. During this period a great extent of grassy turf
  was torn off in the upper part of the stream, probably by a water
  spout. In a few minutes the streamlet, already in high flood,
  became    a muddy tumultuous torrent           in which  no man could have
  stood or lived    ;   swiftly its muddy waters spread out over the salt
  water of Loch Goil ; and then meeting similar floods first at its
  own side, and afterwards from the opposite shore, the united muddy
  torrents covered the whole upper reach of the loch in less than
  half-an-hour     to the extent of two miles in length, and three-quarters

days     of uninterrupted      dry   weather,   during which        the  stream
returned nearly to the same state           in volume      and   appearance as
after the moderate flood already described.             There was this differ
ence,    however, even in its composition         ;  nitrate of silver feebly
indicated     chlorides, and acetate of lead also feebly indicated car
bonates.      The difference    wss probably owing        to a material differ
ence    in the direction and force of    the wind. On the former occasion
the wind blew from the north-east, with              no great violence, over
about 90 miles of land       ;  but on the latter occasion it blew with
fury from west to south-west over Loch Fyne at distances varying
from 18 to 15 miles only.          In the latter case sea-spray must have
been swept up into the air and carried far by the storm.                 In the
former less would be raised into the atmosphere, and much would
be deposited again in passing over 90 miles              of land.    In  1845  I
found chlorides distinctly indicated by a white cloudiness, when
nitrate of silver was added         to rain-water collected on the top of
Goat-Fell in Arran, towards the close of a violent four days' south
westerly gale, attended with frequent heavy rain, the sea in the
direction     of the wind being        12   miles    distant,   and 2800 feet
below.
    The facts now      stated, which    I  have often corroborated by less
minute observation of other streams in the mica-slate district of
Loch Long, Loch Goil, and Loch Lomond, will convey some idea
of the constitution of these waters in three conditions, viz., after
 high floods, moderate floods, and dry weather. To complete the
 series,  it is an object  of interest to   add   their condition     after very
 prolonged drought.       In that    case the streamlets, except those fed
                       " tarns," will           at last to convey only the
 by small upland                        come
 water proceeding from springs;         and many not so supplied will dry
 up altogether.      For the composition of         those   which continue to
 run we may look to the springs themselves which feed them, because
 in their then very low state, running chiefly over rocks and stones,
 their waters will contract little additional impregnation in their
 course downwards.        I have examined several springs          in the mica-
 slate district under consideration.        They    have   generally presented
 rather more saline constituents than the streams             in their ordinary
 state,   and invariably    no  colour appreciable by any of the ocular

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                        553
tests     I    have used     as described above.      Sometimes their salts     are
scanty      ;   but always they are quite colourless.         Their solids  appear
to vary from          a 16,000th to a 21,000th        ; and chlorides   and lime-
salts     are, for the most part, indicated         by their proper liquid tests
 rather     more    distinctly than in the general run of stream waters in
 their ordinary state of fulness. Several small springs high on the
 hill   slopes     have   yielded these results.      Similar in that respect is a
 copious spring in Glen Beg, more familiarly known by the name
 of Hell's Glen, about three miles from Loch-Goil-head in the
 narrow       pass to St Catherine's on       Loch Fyne.      This spring, which
 gushes in force near the highway and close to the valley stream,
  is at all times beautifully         limpid, and seems to be little affected
  in volume by droughts or floods. Its temperature is 44° when
  the air is 64° and more, though its site is not much over 300
  feet above the sea-level.             Its water is perfectly colourless, but
  contains rather more chlorides and earthy salts than the waters
  of the streams in their ordinary condition.                  Another more re
  markable spring of great volume issues from the south flank of
   the Cobbler, about 1500 feet perpendicular               above  the bottom of
  Glen Croe, and leaping from rock to rock, joins the Croe about half
   way up the glen.         In  the very dry season of 1870, its course was the
   only one which showed            any water    among the many which score
   the steep slope of the mountain where it overlooks the glen from
   the north.        I found   the water last autumn, after ten days      of  com
   plete drought, to be perfectly           colourless, and to be so free from
   saline matter as to be barely affected           even   by the delicate liquid
   tests for chlorine and for lime.
       As the various streams          now    described are the feeders     of the
   fresh-water lakes, which abound in              the mica-slate districts,    the
   composition of the water of the lakes must be the same with that
                                                                                   "
   of the average water of the streams.              The small upland " tarns
   are peaty,       owing to the peat which paves           and surrounds them.
   But the great low-lying lakes present very little solid matter of any
    kind in their waters        ; their scanty salts consist of chlorides,      car
    bonates, and sulphates, the bases being lime, soda, and magnesia;
    and the organic       colouring   matter is so small as to be discoverable
    by delicate tests only.         In all  instances, however,   our purest lalto

waters    in   a   mica-slate      country    are   slightly — very        slightly
coloured.
   The water of Loch Katrine            is a well-known       and characteristic
example.      Some years before the proposal was first entertained to
use  it for supplying Glasgow, I found it to contain only a 40,000th
of solids. When compared with a fine spring water, however, it
now presents in a 16-inch glass tube an appreciable, yet very faint,
yellowness.      In  hardness it indicates only 0-65 by the soap-test,
or the equivalent       of a 108,000th      of carbonate of lime.       In    corre
spondence with       this great purity it acts powerfully on lead.                In
three weeks,      a lead plate one inch        and a    half   square,  lost 2"53
grains in weight, which is exactly the loss sustained in distilled
water in the same time          ; and crystals of carbonate of lead were
formed in profusion.
   The water of Loch Lomond is               a less  familiar instance of the
same kind.
   Loch Lomond        is twenty miles long, and at its southern or outlet
end,   rather more than four miles and a half wide.                  Its   average
elevation is only 22 feet above             high-water     mark.     Eight miles
north of its outlet it suddenly contracts at Ross Point to rather
less than a mile across      ;  and the northern division of twelve miles
in length varies in breadth between a mile and only a fourth so
much. The lower wide division of the loch, at a short distance
from the shore, varies in depth on the whole from               8 to 12  fathoms;
and these soundings continue           till near Point Ross, where there           is
a rapid increase to 32 fathoms.            This continues to      be the average
in the middle of the lake, till at        the  next contraction in its width,
opposite Rowardennan           Point, where it singularly shallows at          once
to 9, 8, and 7 fathoms.         A  mile further up, after another swell, it
quickly    deepens at a new contraction at Rhuda Mor (the Great
Point)   to  65 fathoms ; and for five miles further north the sound
ings first steadily deepen by degrees to 105 fathoms, and then
shelve to 80 opposite Inversnaid; above                which     point   the lake
becomes     both much narrower and greatly               less  deep   (Admiralty
Map).     My observations on its waters were made near Tarbet,
which faces the middle of the very deep five-mile reach, where the
soundings in mid-channel are never under 85, and at one place,
opposite Culness farm-house, attain the extreme depth of 100 and

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                               555
even 105 fathoms, — the width there being barely three-fourths of a
mile.
    The surface water over            these   great depths is of remarkable
purity.      Its saline matter is very scanty, and the colouring organic
matter equally so.         Still it  has a faint   yellowish      colour.     On Sep
tember 21st, the second          day after heavy rain, incessant for twelve
 hours, a white porcelain basin, 4 inches in diameter, disappeared in
 18 feet   of water;     on 11th October, after many days                of alternate
 rain   and   drought, in 15 feet      ;  and on 18th November, after four
days of dry weather, in 14 feet, but in feeble                  sunshine.*      After
long drought there is little doubt that the colour would be less, for
it will be seen subsequently, that as the streams pour in fresh sup
plies of water, there is reason to suppose that these penetrate little
before they run off, an     J consequently the coloured flood         waterfrom the
 streams    will colour for    some time the superficial waters           of the lake.
    On 18th November, the water taken from the surface of Loch
   * This is a good method of ascertaining the relative colour of waters if it be
employed with due precautions. The trial should be made in sunshine —
when the sheet of water is quite calm— between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., so that
the sun's rays may not fall too obliquely on the water, and with the back to
the   sun, and, best of all, on the shady side of a boat.      If all these conditions
be reversed, vision will penetrate scarcely half so deep as when they are all
observed.     In my recent trials I have not found a white object visible at a
greater depth than 21 feet, viz., on Loch Lomond on the 6th May. But.
from observations made many years ago, I am satisfied that, after long dry
weather, some river waters will allow such an object as a white porcelain
basin to be seen at a much       greater depth, with due attention to the condi
tions now mentioned.        Having a recollection of seeing it slated long ago,
that the water of the Lake of Geneva was so clear, that objects could be dis
tinguished in it at a very great depth, I applied to Dr Coindet of Geneva for
precise informatien, for which he referred me to Professor Forel of Lausanne.
To Professor Forel's kindness I am indebted for the following interesting
facts :— In the spring of 1869, using a white-painted sheet of iron, 15 inches
by 12, he found that the utmost depth at which it could be seen was 13
metres, or 44 feet.    The transparency is much affected by locality, and very
much too by season.       In winter and spring it is greatest, in summer and
autumn least.     In  the Bay of Morges, objects may be seen distinctly at the
bottom in winter at a depth from        13J to 20 feet, while in summer they are
barely visible through 7 feet.      This difference is greatest near the shore, at
the bottom of bays, and near villages or towns.         It is least around promon
tories, far from land, and at a distance from human habitations.           In autumn
the change from obscurity to transparency usually takes place early in October,
and is completed in three days ; in summer, the reverse change takes place

   556                      Proceedings       of the Royal Society
   Lomond        over     a depth     of  102 fathoms, or 612 feet, presented            in a
   16-inch tube as exactly as possible the same degree of faint yellow
   ish hue as the water of Loch Katrine. Evaporated to dryness, it
   left a pale, greyish film, amounting to                a  33,000th of the water.         It
   had     only 0-70 degrees of hardness by Clark's                   soap-test.      Of   the
   other liquid reagents,               acetate    of lead alone       caused     at once     a
   slight haze;         oxalate of ammonia             and nitrate     of silver had         at
   first no effect, but in time caused an extremely                        faint haziness      ;
   nitrate of baryta, and ammoniacal phosphate of soda had no effect
   at all.      When        the water was        much concentrated, however, sul
  phates, carbonates,            and chlorides,      as well as the bases, lime, soda,
  and magnesia, were clearly indicated by their ordinary tests, exactly
  as in the springs and streams                of the adjacent country.
      I   examined also the water taken at the same place from the
  bottom at the depth of 102                      fathoms.      This differed in       some
  respects      from the surface water directly                above   it.    It contained
  the same       salts.      But nitrate of silver indicated rather              less chlo
  rides   ;   acetate of lead more carbonates              ;  the soap-test denoted           a
  trifling additional           hardness,    namely 0-74 degrees,           and the total
  solids amounted to a 28,000th instead of a 33,000th.                             Farther,
 about      the beginning of May, and is more gradual. By filtering a large
  quantity of turbid water, he found the obscuring cause to be a collection of
 amorphous       dust, living and dead diatoms, vegetable            debris, a few living
 infusoria and crustaceans,          and debris of insect larvae and microscopic Crus
 tacea.      They naturally collect slowly in the summer ; but the first cold of
 approaching winter sends them quickly down with the water as it cools.
     In the case of Loch Lomond, these inquiries of Professor Forel would lead
 one to expect       little influence from organic or inorganic dust in obscuring
 water where it is       so deep as at the places chosen for my observations.        Accord
 ingly, the surface        water was remarkably free from turbidity, or deposit on
 standing at rest.         But the yellowish colour, faint though it be, constitutes a
 no less powerful obstruction to the penetration of light.                    The depth of
colour, and consequently the transparency, vary at different periods, not so
 much     with the seasons as with the times of floods.             In   advanced   summer
 and    in autumn, the        floods  increase   the colour decidedly, and lessen for a
time transparency.            But my single observation on 6th May, when I found
the transparency greatest of all a few days after heavy north-east rain, raises
a question whether floods have the same effect             in spring or the end of winter.
A    probable reason       for the contrary may be, that the soluble matters of the
peat-fields and stream-courses, developed by heat, growth, and atmospheric
action in summer and autumn, are much exhausted by the frequent winter
floods before the arrival of the floods of spring.

 although    the colour is the same at the bottom            as at the surface,
 and very slight, it is distinctly deeper        in shade     when seen in a

 light grey, is of  a rather deep yellowish -brown tint.
    [May   16fA,  1872.   —As   supplementary      to  these   observations,    I
 may here add the following, which           I had an   opportunity of mak
 ing  on the 10th    of last month : — During the five winter months
 intermediate    between    my previous visit in November, the winter
 had been unusually open.        Until the middle of March, indeed, there
 had been very little frost, and no severe cold.           During the latter
 half of March frosty northerly winds prevailed, but without any very
 great fall of the thermometer.         In the last days of March and first
 three days of April, snow fell frequently, covering the Highland
 mountains to their bases.       Ben Lomond and the adjacent Arrochar
 mountains shared in the change.            On 4th   April the wind       veered
to west and south-west;         bright    sunshine and     warmth soon dis
solved most of the snow, and this weather continued, with scarcely
any rain, till after my visit.         The ground around Loch Lomond
 was consequently dry, the      hill  streams  very low, and the streamlets
dried up, or nearly so.
    The surface water corresponded with these antecedent circum
stances.    Frequent     winter floods had swept from the mountains
most of the soluble matter from their beds; and for some days the
streams, reduced to rills, would have little remaining              to remove
from their stony channels.        Hence the surface water was of great
purity.     A  white porcelain basin, two inches in diameter, was
visible at the depth of 16 feet, although        a  light  breeze rippled the
surface.    In  a 16-inch    tube    the yellowish    colour was extremely
faint.  The solid contents amounted to only a 32,000th of the water,
and lost a fourth by incineration.*           Nitrate of silver occasioned
in the water only the faintest haze, and oxalate of ammonia did
not visibly affect    it.   The soap-test indicated 0-49 of hardness,
which is equivalent to a 145,000th        of carbonate of lime. In accord
ance with its purity this water acted powerfully on lead.               Action
commenced at once, loose crystals of carbonate of lead were formed
       • 26,260 grains left C 83 at 300° F., and 0 62 after incineration.

square lost     I'll grain    in weight.
    The bottom water, taken where the depth was 594 feet, differed
materially in these characters.           The cistern brought up some finely
comminuted peat-like matter, in which the microscope detected a
profusion of various diatoms, and two species of active microcosmic
animals.      The colour of the water was deeper than that of the sur
face, and became the same not           till the addition  of half its volume of
colourless distilled water.         Nitrate of silver produced an immedi
ate    scanty precipitate,       oxalate    of ammonia scarcely any effect.
The soap-test indicated 1-015 of hardness, which is the equivalent
of a 69,000th of carbonate of lime. The solids amounted to a
16,000th of the water, and lost a third by incineration.*               When the
water was evaporated to a tenth of its volume, nitrate of silver
indicated chlorides in abundance, nitrate of baryta sulphates feebly,
oxalate of ammonia lime sparingly,               and   phosphate of ammonia
magnesia faintly.          The original water had no action at all on
lead.     The lead plate became dull in a few hours, but no other
change ensued which the eye could discover; and in twenty-
three days the plate, which              originally weighed 405-73 grains,
weighed 405-74 grains.
    These differences between the bottom and surface waters were so
great, that    it became     desirable to repeat the examination, which          I
was able to do on the 6th           of the present month. A good deal of
easterly rain had fallen for some days until two days before this
visit ; but the hill streams had already become low. The waters
were collected near the same            place as before, — the bottom water
from a depth of 94 fathoms, or 564 feet.               The cistern brought    up,
as formerly, some peaty-like          matter, which speedily subsided, and
was promptly removed           by decantation.      Both specimens of water
were very pure.         But the bottom water       was more affected     than the
surface water both by nitrate of silver and by oxalate of ammonia,
and its colour was decidedly deeper, so that fully more than half its
volume of colourless distilled water required to be added, to produce
the feeble tint of the water from the surface.!               The peaty matter
   • 18,125 grains left 0-82
                                grains at 300, and 0-66 after incineration,

was found by microscopical examination to abound in diatoms and
skeleton tissues of graminaceous and other vegetables.              The bottom
 water contained a 25,000th of solids.
    It  has been proposed,    in projects for introducing      lake water into
 a town for domestic uses, to draw the water from a considerable
 depth, instead of from the surface, under the supposition that the
 deep water is the purest.        The preceding observations show that
 this is  a mistake, at least in the case of some lakes.        On every occa
 sion  I have  found the water of Loch Lomond somewhat more saline
 in its   deepest   parts than at the surface immediately above, and
 decidedly more coloured.         The    cause  is easily understood,     if  the
preceding chemical examination            be taken     in connection with the
observations to be subsequently made on the temperature of Loch
 Lomond at various depths.         For the results of both inquiries         con
cur in indicating that, in the very deep parts, there is a vast body
of still water which undergoes little, or, perhaps, no change or
movement, and which, therefore, at the bottom, will become impreg
nated with whatever is soluble in the bed on which it rests.
    Let   me now change the scene to the          hills and the waters of the
Lowlands.
    In the course of late notorious proceedings in this city for obtain
ing a more abundant water supply, it was stated by good chemical
authorities    that   the water of St Mary's Loch in Selkirkshire,
although     of remarkable purity,      does not exert upon metallic lead
that eroding action which is a singular property of all pure waters
previously subjected to trial. This statement was so opposed to
the principles regulating the action of waters upon               lead, as pro
pounded by me so long ago as 1829, and also to the facts brought
forward both then and in a paper             read   to this Society    in  1842,
       I
that resolved to investigate the question for myself.
    This undertaking, in spite of my strong repugnance and steady
refusal to be involved on either side of the Edinburgh water-con
troversy, led indirectly to my being compelled to concern myself
with it   as a parliamentary witness.       But let it   be clearly understood
and it was never used except for these experiments. The cistern was emptied
at once into stoppered bottles on being drawn into the boat, and was carefully
dried in a current of air with the valves open.

that my inquiries were undertaken quite irrespective of all contro
versial proceedings, parliamentary                       or otherwise, and for a purely
scientific object — in which point of view alone I shall now proceed
to state them.    In the present place, I shall notice the lead ques
tion slightly, reserving that inquiry for another head of my obser
vations.          At present       I    have    to say a few words              of other matters
which arose incidentally                           of my inquiries.
                                         before me in the course
   St Mary's Loch is a lonely lake, retired among the hills of Sel
kirkshire, 37 miles south from Edinburgh. It is three miles long,
and about half a mile in width at its broadest parts ; but it may be
said to be prolonged nearly another mile by the Loch of the Lowes
above      it,   which   is   separated         only by   a   space   of    150 yards,      through
which the upper loch               is   joined to St Mary's Loch by              a    small stream.
The lake in most parts shelves rapidly to                       a    depth of 30 or 40 feet          ;
in various parts         it   is   said to deepen to 80, 100, and even 150 feet                      ;
and at     a     place pointed out to me as the deepest,                    I        found 144 feet
of water.         It discharges         itself in   a   goodly body of water, by            a   broad,
shallow outlet to constitute the Yarrow Water.                                       This joins the
Ettrick     a    mile and     a    quarter above Selkirk         ;    and the united waters,
under the name of Ettrick, are poured, after                          a    course     of about four
miles more, into the river Tweed.                        The Yarrow runs over               11 miles
in   a   right line, but 14 miles by its windings, in                       a   very stony chan
nel, obviously of great width in floods.
     The country of the Yarrow                  and St Mary's         Loch      is   almost entirely
pastoral, except where covered at the lower end of the stream by
the beautiful woods                of Bowhill, Philipshaugh, Hangingshaw, and
other country seats.                  Around the lake itself the land may be de
scribed     as    consisting purely of pastoral hills, the attempts at arable
culture being as yet very limited,                      and   wood        hitherto    a   scanty and
stunted ornament.                  The level of the lake              is   almost exactly 800
feet above         the sea.         It   is    bordered everywhere, and abruptly,                   by
hills rising from         750 to 1000 feet above               it,   showing long sky-lines,
and steep slopes          which present             no rocks, no woods,                nothing      but
smooth grass, unbroken save where scored                             bya    few stream courses,
mostly waterless in dry weather.                           But the Meggat Water is a
considerable permanent stream, seven                       miles in direct length, which
falls into St Mary's Loch about its middle line on the north                                    ;   and
the Little Yarrow, three miles in direct length, feeds the Loch of

                       of Edinburgh,         Session 1871-72.                    561
the Lowes        at  its upper end.           These streams,     though short, are
voluminous,       because      constantly supplied by numberless hill tribu
taries.
     A   traveller on the loch-side          sees no peat anywhere.        The dis
trict     was therefore pronounced            by recent one-eyed visitors to be
free from peat.         An inquisitive observer might         have suspected      the
reverse from        one     of the highest surrounding          hills being called
Peat-Law       ; and on the high sky-line of another, a telescope would
have betrayed to him a very suspicious circumstance in a crowd of
little peat-stacks. Any one, not content with creeping along the
bottom of valleys, but familiar with the summits of the mountains
 of the Scottish Lowlands, would then have known that the sky
 line seen from the loch-side is not, — as it very often is in the
 primitive mountains of the Highlands, — a mere ridge, but forms
 the edge of a great table-top, which, in most cases, is chiefly com
 posed     of peat.       In point of fact Professor Geikie         has shown last
 summer, from the Government Geological Survey, that a vast pro
 portion of the hill-tops in the St Mary's              district   consists of peat
 table-lands.
     The    consequences       which flow from this structure of the country
  are peculiar.      In    dry weather the high peaty summits of the hills
  will cease to supply moisture enough to drain into the streamlets
  which score their sides.          These will then convey to the lake chiefly
  the drainage     of the grassy       slopes,   and the produce of the scanty
  springs in the lower regions.              But when a rain-flood sets in, the
  peat, whether previously dry or moist, will send down a profusion
  of peaty water. Had the Yarrow flowed as a river through the
  vale at St Mary's, the peaty flood would have been swept quickly
  down towards the sea ; and in two or three days the waters would
  have recovered      from their peaty impregnation.            But the two lochs,
  with a superficial         area   of two    square miles, store    up the peaty
  water, and dole      it   out,  like  a compensation     pond, for many days,
  until the arrival of a fresh flood to renew it.             An embankment         at
  the outlet, to increase the            storage,  would   protract the      outflow,
   and postpone     still further the recovery of the water from impurity.
      These facts and views could only occur to one familiar with the
   district, or going thither to study it for a practical object. When
   I first  went to St Mary's Loch on the 12th and 13th                June last,    I
      vol. vn.                                                            4 F

562                Proceedings      of the Royal Society
had no further      acquaintance with the        hill structure around than
that of an angler thirty years ago, when             I probably looked more
at what came       out of the loch than at anything             else concerning
it.    I consequently went prepossessed        in its favour by the glowing
account given of its extreme purity by its admirers.                My surprise,
therefore, was not small when my very first observation showed
that its water was yellow.          My visit   was made       in circumstances
highly favourable to its condition, in splendid sunshine, being the
last two days of six weeks        of extraordinarily    dry weather, broken
only by a few light showers,          sufficient to freshen the grass, and
little   more.  But   I found that my white porcelain basin became at
once yellowish when dropped into the lake, acquired a               lively amber
hue    at the depth of 3 feet,       and disappeared entirely at 12 feet,
while the sun shone brightly on the spot.                I   remembered well,
however, having once distinguished          small pebbles in the Dumfries
shire Esk through 16 feet of water, when spearing salmon in a still
pool, and on another occasion through           21 feet    in  a pool below the
Bracklinn Falls, near Callander.          I afterwards tested the colour of
the loch water on a small scale, and showed                 it satisfactorily to
many, by comparing it with the water of Edinburgh of the same
date in two narrow glass jars, 20 inches in height, with a circular
disc of white porcelain at the bottom. The porcelain was of un
stained whiteness as seen through the Edinburgh water,                   but of a
lively    amber tint when looked at through the water of St Mary's
Loch.      The difference was not less marked in the narrow 16-inch
tubes.      Even in dining-table water-bottles, placed on a white table
cloth, the colour of the loch water was such as to make it evident,
that certainly     nobody would drink it who could get the other.               I
may add that, when         I  revisited the loch on 8th September, also
in bright sunshine,       I  found that my porcelain basin disappeared
entirely in eight feet of water ; and, nevertheless, there had been
previously ten continuous days of absolutely dry weather.
    On the 12th and 13th June,        I saw in the water no want           of the
water-fleas, which excited so much interest and heat in the late
 controversy.     It may create additional        interest with       some  to be
 told that three months later they were decidedly bigger, busier,
 and altogether more deserving of their vernacular name.
    Before speaking of the chemical           composition      of the water, let

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                       563
me finish what may be said of the physical characters of the loch,
by noticing     one not yet adverted to.        Visitors in the dry   season,
when      the waters   of the lake     are somewhat shrunk,        have been
much struck with the beauty of its border, — its " silver strand."
This is owing to       a uniform beach of crowded, chiefly angular, or
partially rounded, light-grey coloured       stones.    The colour, however,
is not their own, but belongs to a generally dense covering of a dried        -
up matter, composed of       a multitude of various diatoms entangled in
the delicate lines of a finely fibrous conferva.          In the fresh   state
this investing matter is dark greenish-brown, close, and slimy. The
stones, therefore, give the loch, even in its shallows, a disagreeable,
dark, deep appearance,      abruptly defined by the water's edge.         But
all of them out of water acquire, in drying,        a light grey or greyish-
white hue.       Every scientific visitor   has observed,    and some    have
carefully examined, these       stones and their covering.         But, so far
as   I  am aware, no one has noted their       full significance  ; of which
more presently, when       I come   to speak of the Yarrow.
    The water of the loch, though it is coloured, is a pure water, —
in the sense that it contains very little solid matter in solution.
 It has been repeatedly analysed, and found to contain rather less
than    a  20,000th part of total solids.    Mr Dewar, the latest analyst,
 I believe,   found a   22,440th, —  of which the inorganic salts consti
 tuted two-thirds [a 37,000th], and the organic matter one-third [a
 55,500th].      The chief inorganic salts are the same as in the mica-
 slate streams and lochs of the Highlands, and much in the same
 proportion to one another.       The hardness of the       water was found
 by  Mr Dewar      to be  l-30  degrees by the soap-test,     or nearly twice
 that of Loch Lomond surface water.            Other chemists have found
 more solids, some less.       My own results, with water collected         on
 13th June,      show more saline, and rather less organic, matter             ;
 which is no more than might have been anticipated from the long
 antecedent very dry weather.         I  found the solid contents dried at
 about     300° F. to be a 15,000th     of the   water  ; one-fourth   of this
 was destroyed by slow incineration at a low red heat; and the hard
 ness was 2-0 degrees    of Clark's soap-test scale, — which is about the
  fourth part of that of the present Edinburgh water supply.            Water
 collected three months later, on 8th September, after ten days of
  complete drought, which,       after a few days      of showery weather,

564                     Proceedings of          the   Boyal Society
followed the very heavy floods of 24th August,                           contained more
colouring matter, exhibited                less action with           the ordinary liquid
tests for the inorganic               salts, and      had   a hardness     of 1"4 degree
only.     I   have no doubt that this water corresponded                   in all respects
very closely with the specimen examined by Mr Dewar.
     Thus, it appears,            that the waters       of St Mary's       Loch    — which,
with the exception perhaps of those in the primitive districts of                     Kirk
cudbrightshire          and Wigtownshire,             may be taken as a type of the
lowland lochs at large —differ from the waters                          of the Highland
lakes in containing more solid matter, a little more saline matter,
and decidedly more colouring                   organic matter, and in being consi
                                              "    "
derably harder, though really belonging to the soft waters                              too.
Another difference is that they vary more with the season, the salts
becoming rather more                  abundant in long dry weather, and the
colouring matter clearly abounding more during and after floods.
Finally,      a remarkable difference in property, to be discussed                      by-
and-by,       is,   that unlike the waters         of the Highland lochs, that            of
St Mary's Loch does not erode lead.                         But first let me say a word
or two     about       the Yarrow        Water, by which this lake discharges
itself.
     The Yarrow, before uniting with the Ettrick, winds for 14 miles
through       a     narrow, bare, chiefly pastoral vale, bounded by gently
sloping hills.          It   is   joined in this   course by twenty-two tributaries,
of which only three or four are considerable streamlets, the others
being mostly rills, apt to be dried up, or nearly so, in dry weather.
The     waters of the chief tributaries               contain    in   the dry season more
salts than the main stream   itself, but very much less colouring
matter, two of them, indeed, none at all appreciable even in a 16-
inch tube.           The channel of the Yarrow              is   wide and stony, and the
stream shallow, and for the most part turbulent.                          In the   14 miles
it   falls 220 feet.         Its banks present very few human habitations.
     These circumstances are favourable to the gradual diminution of
organic impregnations, partly through the decomposing influence
of fresh earthy salts added here and there by little tributaries,
partly by the slow oxidation, to which Liebig gave the name of
" Eremacausis," — "quiet" or " slow burning."  My attention was
turned very long ago, before                  the publication of Liebig's          views on
this subject, to the               rapidity    with which,        by natural      processes,

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                               565
streams rid themselves of the unnatural impurities introduced into
them by sewage, and by some of the manufactures. But am not                  I
aware that the        process     of clearing      has been watched       with care in
circumstances       altogether natural.           It  occurred to me, at anyrate,
that     we  have    in the Yarrow         a most favourable opportunity            for
tracing this process in the case of a natural water of a remarkable
 kind, under the operation of natural causes alone. On the 8th of
 September, therefore,        I    examined the course of the Yarrow with
 some attention.
     In  its descent from St Mary's             Loch,    it is first joined by two
 unimportant rills, at that time nearly dried up by ten days of pre
 vious drought.         A mile and a half below its outlet, it receives
 from the north its largest tributary,                 the Douglas       Burn,  which
 drains    a very  hilly   country about five miles and a half long and
 four miles wide.        This    stream, indeed, was at the time a small           rill,
 compared with the strong body of water in the Yarrow.                          But it
 was interesting       in this respect,       that its water, containing          more
 saline matter than the main              stream,    and possessing the hardness
 of   4-90 degrees, presented        no colour at all, even when examined in
 a 16-inch    tube.     This last fact is remarkable,           because the Douglas
 Burn    comes very much from peat- topped                 hills, so that either the
 peaty water of floods          soon    runs out in dry weather,           and spring-
 water is alone left, or the water clears itself by eremacausis,                  or in
  its upper    course    in the way in which purification                 seems to be
 brought about in the Yarrow.
     For, when     I   came    to examine the         Yarrow immediately         above
  the junction of the Douglas Burn,             I  found to my surprise that the
  colour, which at the outlet was such as to render                 a  porcelain basin
  invisible when sunk        8 feet    only, was already so much reduced,            in
  the course of   a  mile and a half,       as to approach the faint hue of the
  waters of Loch        Katrine and Loch Lomond.                   There was also a
  slight increase of salts, as shown by the ordinary liquid tests, and
  also by the hardness of the water having increased                  from 1-4 to 2-40
  degrees.
     A mile lower down another principal tributary, but inferior                      to
  the Douglas Burn, falls          into the Yarrow on the right, the Altrieve
  Burn, which, however,          I  had not time enough to examine.                Two
  miles further     on a    similar streamlet joins from the right,                 the

566                 Proceedings of         the Royal Society
Sundhope, which, too,          I could not examine.          Other trifling rills,
almost dried up, join between           the Douglas Burn and Yarrow kirk,
seven   miles from the outlet of the lake.               This point   was a good
one for studying the       joint   effect   of atmospheric exposure through
constant agitation, and of the influx of several brooks, all probably
containing more salts than the main stream itself.                  Here  I found
that the soap-test indicated          a further    increase of hardness to     3 0
degrees,    and that the yellow          colour in a 16-inch tube was         still
further reduced, but not much.
   In  the next three miles and a half there are six little tributaries,
all at the time of my visit insignificant,           and some quite dried up.
till we   arrive at the Lewenshope             Burn,   which drains     from   the
north a considerable stretch of the Minchmoor                 range, described to
me as generally stony         hills, without much       peat.    This water pos
sessed 6'5     degrees    of hardness, and so little colour that it was
barely appreciable in a 16-inch tube.                 In the remainder of its
course the Yarrow is joined by five more rille, either almost dried
up when     I was   there, or appropriated        in  a great measure for the
supply of mansions.           Four hundred yards        above its  junction with
the Ettrick,    I found     its water to possess, as at      Yarrow kirk, seven
miles higher up, 3'0 degrees of hardness,            so that the comparatively
saline water of the Lewenshope               bad not materially increased the
salts of the Yarrow.          But the colour     was   still more  reduced,  so as
to be very    faint indeed, equally        so with the colour    of the water of
Loch Lomond.
   Thus    the   principal loss of colour takes place in the first mile
and a half of the river's course         ;  but there was also a very appreci
able  additional     improvement in the longer course below, and the
final result was a nearly total removal of colour.
   To what is this change owing? Does it depend entirely on the
intermixture      of earthy salts from the tributaries, and on erema-
causis  ?   I apprehend        that these causes will scarcely account for
the great change effected in the first mile and a half.               There may
even be a doubt whether peat-extract is particularly               subject to the
process   of eremacausis.        It  is well known to be a preservative         of
organic matters, which it could scarcely be were it very subject to
decay itself;     and  I   find that a solution of         it without any saline
matter, has undergone no change in               a  warm room, in a half-filled

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                            567
bottle, during six months. But there is a more potent agent at
work in the Yarrow. The dark, green-coated stones of the loch,
with all       their characters unreduced, pave the entire channel of the
stream        as low at least as the confluence          of the Douglas Burn, and,
with        a less abundant         covering, so     low at least as Yarrow kirk,
seven miles from the outlet of the lake. But there is nothing of
the kind in the chief tributaries. At the junction, for example,
of the Douglas Burn, there is an abrupt line of demarcation be
 tween the dark green, slippery               stones  of the Yarrow, and the     stones
 of the tributary, which            are as naked as     if they had been scrubbed
 clean with        a brush.      I  do not well see how to escape the conclu
 sion, that the        confervae    and    diatoms of the stones live at the cost
 of the peaty matter from the loch, — that peat-extract                   is their food
  and is consumed by them.                 This is   a ready explanation       of their
 excessive growth on the stones of the loch.                      The want of such
  food equally explains the comparative absence                   of them from the
  stony banks of Loch Lomond, and the stony channels of all the
  streams of the adjacent                mica-slate    district.*    Indeed,    in the
  opposite circumstance — in              some    mountain    tarns of the district,
  resting, as they may, on peat, and surrounded by                  it — the slippery,
  dark green, stony bottom is no uncommon occurrence.
       If   these   views be correct, it is easy to appreciate both the un
  favourable significance in a lake of             a  dark-green bottom of stones,
  densely covered          with    conferva) and diatoms, and likewise             their
  value in      a running     stream   ;  and it may be well also not to let the
  imagination        run away luxuriating in every "silver strand" that
  meets the eye.
      The Temperature of the Deep Fresh-water Lakes of this country
  has no connection with             the preceding inquiries, further than that
  my observations           on    the subject arose incidentally        while    I   was
  carrying on the inquiries in question.                The results  I have   obtained
  may interest the cultivator              of physical geography,      if   I am   right
      *  It  has been    said that stones covered with green conferva and other
   diatoms    do occur   in Loch-Lomond.         They do in bays and other shallows ;
   but the covering is very thin ; and the line of such stones is narrow. Where
   deep water is near there are none at the edge, and where they do occur the
   dry stones close to the edge appear quite clean.

     In       the course     of the discussion of the St Mary's                      Loch water-
supply scheme, opposite opinions were expressed as to the relative
advantage of drawing the water from the surface                                of the       lake,    or
from a considerable depth; and weighty arguments, of                                  a   specula
tive nature, were               advanced on      both sides of the question.                         It
occurred to me, therefore, to consider what becomes                                  of the deep
water.          Does it escape as that of the surface must do                    ?    And if        so,
How       ?     It   appeared   to me that during a winter of such                    protracted
cold as that of 1870-71, the water at the bottom would probably
acquire so low a temperature, that it must long remain there.                                   For
it   can only rise again, either by its temperature                       falling below 39°-5,
when its density decreases instead of continuing                           to increase,   or by
being heated by the heat of the earth beneath                         ;    and   it is unlikely
that the temperature of the entire water of                           a deep     lake will fall
lower than 39°-5, or indeed so low, in this latitude, and the heat
derived from the earth, in our latitude at the elevation of 800 feet
above the sea, must be inconsiderable.                     It   is well known that the
bottom cannot be heated                by conduction       from the summer heat of
the       atmosphere above,           as    in the      case     of   a    solid      substance      ;
and       the effect        of the penetration of the sun's                  rays,     by which
the      water is heated         to   a certain depth, cannot descend very low
in a lake, the water of which                    is,   like that of St Mary's Loch,
so coloured as to render              a    very white object invisible at the depth
of   8   or 12 feet.        The conclusion would           be that the water at the
bottom         of the      deep parts of the       lake, in the absence                of   strong
springs — of the existence of which there neither proof nor pro is
        —
bability will remain at the bottom for want of   current during            a
the whole warm season, and perhaps longer.
     When      I     was first at St Mary's       Loch     on 12th and 13th               June, I
had      no suitable thermometer for taking                    observation of deep tem
peratures.           But     Mr Dewar kindly undertook to make the necessary
trial    a    few days     later in the same month. With Six's thermometer,
                                                                      a
whose graduation was subsequently tested and found correct, he ascer
tained that in 150 feet               soundings, the temperature, being 56 at
the surface, was 46° at the bottom.                     When    I     revisited St Mary's
Loch      on 8th September, nearly three months afterwards, the inter

                          of Edinburgh,        Session 1871-72.                      569
mediate weather having been generally fine, I found, with the
same thermometer, in 96 feet of water, near the head of the
lake, 56° at the surface and 54° at the bottom; and in 144
feet of water, in the middle of the loch, exactly opposite the
 17th milestone from Selkirk,               I  obtained 55° at the surface and
 47° at the bottom.          During three of the warmest months of last
 warm season, the heat of the earth, or the sun's rays, had heated
 the water at the bottom by one degree                 of Fahrenheit only.           I do
 not well     see   how that water can ever rise from such a depth, unless
 its temperature during the winter should fall below                    39°'5, which
 is not probable.
       I regret I did    not take successive       observations at several depths
  in order to fix the upper limit of the cold substratum of water.                    My
 time was short, for my main object on that occasion was the changes
 undergone by the river Yarrow, and                   I    contemplated a chain of
 observations in more favourable circumstances at Loch Lomond.
 I    went to Loch Lomond           on four occasions for the purpose, viz., on
 September 14th, September                 21st,   October 11th and 12th,             and
  November 18th.           As accurate observations          were made   only     on the
  two last occasions,      I shall    refer to the others only incidentally.
       On 11th October, at 3 p.m., the atmospheric temperature on land
  being 48°, and that of the surface water everywhere over deep sound
  ings 52°,     I found   in  103 fathoms      of water opposite Culness, with            a
  Six's thermometer by Casella, which, though not specially protected
  against high pressure, was believed to be proof against such pres
  sures as     it  was  to be subjected to, that a temperature               of  43° was
    indicated     at 200 feet, and 41°-8 steadily at 400, 500, and 618 feet.

     It   will   be observed        that these temperatures correspond almost
exactly with such observations of the previous day as were made a

that on September 21st, when the surface temperature was 54°, and
also on October 11th,               when    it     was 52°, the thermometer, on           the
instrument        arriving at the surface,                  indicated       44°  in the water
brought up from the bottom, both in 87 and 103                              fathoms of water.
As the heating of the cistern in ascending must have                                      been very
nearly or altogether the same on both occasions,                           it   follows that the
corrected temperature at the bottom, as on 11th October, was 42°
on 21st September.
     On 18th November          I     found    it   to be also the same.             Cold weather
had set in for      a   week before.          The air        was frosty, the ground                  dry
and hard, the atmosphere very clear and perfectly                               still.     Near the
lower end of the loch, where                 the highway first touches                    it,   the air
temperature was 33° at half-past eleven.                           At Tarbet       at one p.m.,       it
was on land, but at the water's edge, 37°                   ;   in the     boat, in the middle
of the loch, two feet above its surface, 42°                       ;   and in surface water,
over 610 feet soundings, 46°.                 At the bottom, by            a Casella's thermo
meter,      protected against pressure,                 and corresponding          exactly in its
graduation with the unprotected one previously                              used, the bottom
temperature was again 42°.                  My design to            make at the same time
another complete series of observations, was prevented by unex
pected delays shortening my time very much, so that                              I       had to con
fine myself to      a   single additional observation, for determining more
nearly the upper limit of the cold substratum of water.                                         At   250
feet I      obtained     a   temperature of 42°-25, and consequently                                 the
upper limit of the water at 42° must have been as nearly as pos
sible at 270 feet in 610 feet soundings.
     Before drawing confident                 deductions from these observations,
they      require      to be       repeated        at    other seasons.             But         in   the
meanwhile         it   may be        well     to    see    what      are    likely to           be   the
results,

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                               571
    It   is  plain,  in the first   place,   that    in a deep lake in this
latitude,     there is a very gradual and slight increase of cold in
the     warm season     for the first hundred feet,         viz., by 2°-5 only,
then     a sudden descent      by 6°'0   in the next 50         feet  only; next
another      slow descent by 2°-5 in        150   feet  ;   and finally,      below
that     a great substratum      of 250    feet  of   water,    and at a deeper
spot of no less than 350 feet, at the uniform temperature of 42°, or
a   little  less.   Next, at Loch Lomond no change took place in the
temperature of the bottom water during two months of unusual
warmth for the months of September and October, and no change
at 300 feet from the surface during           five weeks prior to the middle
of November.
    It  seems certain that the temperature          of the great substratum
of cold water cannot be raised after the middle of November, when
the cold season has fairly set in. Whether it is to be lowered
during winter, or whether the substratum, without becoming colder,
 will merely have its upper level raised, is a question to be settled
 by observation at an early period of next spring.
    In   the meanwhile, abstracting the highly improbable existence
 of strong springs at the great depths        I  have mentioned,       it does not
 appear how this vast cold substratum could have been moved dur
 ing last summer and autumn.             Neither    does   it  appear how     it can
 be moved      during the winter, unless the equally great stratum            above
 it acquire    a lower temperature than 42°, and so take its place              ;  for
 the uniformity of the bottom temperature             between     21st September
 and 18th November, when no additional cold could descend through
 the warmer stratum above, is sufficient proof that the influence of
 the heat of the earth beneath is too feeble in this latitude to make
 itself sensibly felt by motion of the water.
     Thus there is a probability, that when water once descends to so
 great a depth as the bottom of our deep lakes, it cannot ascend
 again except under rare and extraordinary circumstances.                   If this
 view be correct, the movement of the waters of a deep lake towards
 its outlet for escape, must be confined very much to the warm
 water at its surface, or to no great depth, and, therefore, mainly to
 the waters which are constantly supplied on            all  sides by its feeding
 streams.      This must   be the case  in summer      and in autumn      ;  it may
 be   the case in winter also

 572                   Proceedings      of the   Royal Society
    [May    18, 1872.    — Circumstances having delayed the publication
of the Society's Proceedings, I take this opportunity of adding the
result of recent and conclusive observations. These were made on
 10th April and 6th May, as near as I could to the place of the
observations described above.
   April      10. — The weather on         this   occasion was        very fine and
favourable for my purpose.             During the whole winter period after
 November        18th, the date      of the last observations, the weather
 had been remarkably open.              The mean temperature of the atmo
sphere for the five intervening months, as kindly calculated for me
by   Mr Buchan, Secretary of the Meteorological                       Society, from
observations at Balloch           Castle, at the southern end of the loch,
was 1°'4 higher than the average             for the same months for thirteen
previous years.*         Consequently, the same influence of the winter
season on the temperature           of  deep waters    cannot be expected as in
ordinary winters, or in a hard winter, such as the preceding one of
 1870-71.
    When      I made     my observations, about       3 p.m.   on 10th April, the
temperature of the air on land was 55°             ; and on the water, one mile
from the shore whence the wind                  blew, it was 53° in the boat,
scarcely 2 feet above the surface of the lake.                 The following    tem
peratures were obtained, at various depths in the same place                  :—

      The thermometer in Adie's cistern, when brought up full of
water from the bottom, but raised rather deliberately, stood at 42°-5.
      It   appears,          from these and the preceding observations, that in
the deep parts of Loch Lomond there is a substratum of water of
several hundred feet, which, between the end of September last
and 10th April, has been steadily of the temperature of 42°                                             ;   and
that during last winter no other change has taken place,                                        in relation
to temperature in or near                        it,   than that the level of the cold sub
stratum rose in the interval                           between 70 and 100 feet.                 A   winter,
materially colder than the last unusually mild one, would at least
raise that level still nearer                          the surface.         Whether     it   may reduce
the temperature still lower than 42°,                             isa   question which remains
to be decided by future observation.                               It   is   still   also   a   matter for
 observation, whether the temperature of the substratum may not
rise  little during summer. For
       a                                may be reasonably said, that
                                                             it
the unusually hard winter of 1870-71 might have lowered the tem
perature of the substratum in April of last year below that observed
 in   April of this year after                    a    very open winter, and, consequently,
under 42°, which was the temperature observed in October.                                         But the
difference,        if      any, cannot be considerable              ;   for   it   can only arise from
the heating power of the earth on which the water rests.
      The water of               a   lake   is   heated    in summer and autumn in three
ways — the heat of the atmosphere, that of the sun's rays, and that
of the earth.                    The atmosphere will communicate its heat to                                 so
much of the superstratum only as                            is   disturbed, more or less, by the
wind       ;    and, therefore, cannot penetrate many feet.                                 The tempera

574                Proceedings    of the Royal Society
ture of the earth at the bottom, from 500 to 600 feet under the sea-
level, should be by theory about 60° in the deepest parts       ;  but, con
sidering the very low conducting power of the rocky structure of the
earth, its heating power over so vast a bed of cold water must be
very feeble.     The sun's rays  are at once the most energetic heating
power, that which penetrates deepest,         and that which      alone can
sensibly heat any part of the superstratum of water underneath
the thin bed near the surface, where it is aided by the warmth of
the atmosphere, and the stirring of the water by the wind.               But
there is a limit to the sun's penetration      in such depths, when the
water, as in the case of Loch Lomond, is coloured, however slightly.
It   has been imagined     that the presence of springs at the bottom
may be a fourth source of influence over the temperature.           If there
be any springs there, the effect must be to heat the water.          But, as
there are no springs in Scotland which rise above the surface, or pre
sent other proofs   of owing their place to unusual    sources of pressure,
it seems most improbable that any are so constituted as to overcome
the pressure which exists at the bottom of a very deep lake.
    Every known consideration, — the great thickness of the cold
substratum, its steady low temperature, and its greater colour than
at the surface   —contributes   proof that this substratum can undergo
little or  no movement, unless an unusually       hard winter should dis
place   it by colder water from above.*]
    The previous observations have extended          to so great a   length
that   I must  postpone  till another opportunity the remarks which         I
have    prepared  on the  third of my promised topics — the Action of
Water on Lead.

Geneva, Thun, and Lucerne, and by the late eminent engineer, Mr Jaraet
Jardine, on Loch Lomond and Loch Katrine in 1814.         Their observations
are not entirely concordant with those given above.    I contemplate further
ibservations which may reconcile them.

Sir ROBERT CHRISTISON,                   Bart., President, in the Chair.
   The following Communications               were read     : —
   1. On the Computation           of the Strengths of the Parts of
       Skeleton or Open Structures.              By Edward Sang.
   The first part of the paper is devoted to the computation of the
strengths of the parts of a structure destined to resist given
strains, taking into account, along with those strains, the unknown
weights of the parts.       The results obtained by this process neces
sarily give the best    possible arrangement of the strengths, since, if
any one     part were made       weaker, the whole structure would            be
weakened;      or,   if a part were     made   stronger,     the unnecessary
weight thus thrown upon the other parts would also go to weaken
the fabric.    It  is believed that this investigation          has  now been
given for the first time.
   It was pointed out that this method enables us to determine the
utmost limit of magnitude        of a  structure  having a given general
configuration.
   The  second part concerned deficient or flexible            structures ;  the
mode   of discovering      the relations    among the applied pressures,
needed   to cause the structure to assume           a prescribed form, was
indicated.
   Thirdly, the     case  of redundant structures       was    gone into.     It
was observed    that the absolute strains on the parts of such struc
tures depend, not merely on their form, but also on the manner of
putting them together.        The changes on these strains caused by
additional   loads can, however, be computed by considering                  the
compressions or distensions of the parts;          and   it was pointed out
that the computation of these changes has been mistaken for that
of the absolute strains.
   Lastly, there     was investigated     a new   general theorem, which
may be stated as follows      : —
   When     we apply a pressure       to some point    of  a  flexible system,

576                       Proceedings                of the Royal Society
the yielding is not necessarily in the direction                                   of the    pressure.
There       is,   however, always one direction of coincidence, and there
may be three.              When there               are three,    if   two of these form      a   right
angle, the third           is      also perpendicular           to both of them.

     This    paper        is   a    sequel     to several communications                  which have

Society of Edinburgh.*                         It    commences with an investigation                 of
the circumstances under which                         a   portion of an incompressible fric-
tionless liquid, supposed                    to extend through all space, or through
space wholly or            partially bounded by                a   rigid solid, can       be projected
so as to continue                  to move through the surrounding                        liquid with
out change of shape                 ;    and goes on to investigate vibrations exe
cuted       by    a   portion of liquid so projected, and slightly disturbed
from the condition that gives uniformity.                           The greatest and least
quantities of energy which                     a     finite liquid mass of any given initial

investigated          ;   and the theory of the dissipation                        of energy in        a
finite or infinite frictionless liquid                    is   deduced.       A   finite space, filled
with incompressible liquid, traversed by                            a    great multitude of parts
of itself, each very small in comparison with the average distance
of any one of the parts from its nearest neighbour,      next con                      is
sidered, and thus               a    kinetic        theory of gases, without           the assump

    Le  Sage, born at Geneva in 1724, devoted                 the last sixty-three
years of a life of eighty to the investigation of a mechanical theory
of gravitation.         The probable existence of a gravific mechanism is
admitted       and the importance of the              object to which      Le   Sage
devoted his       life pointed out, by Newton              and   Rumford*    in the
following statements : —
    " It is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without
 " the mediation of
                             something else, which is not material, operate
"
    upon, and affect other matter without mutual contact ; as it must
"   do,  if  gravitation,     in the sense of Epicurus,           be essential and
" inherent in it.                                             I

                             gravity to me.

        anything     else, by and      through

                  competent faculty of thinking, can ever fall into it.
   * On the other hand, by the middle of last century the mathematical
naturalists of the Continent, after half a century of resistance to the Newtonian
principles (which, both by them and by the English followers of Newton, were
commonly supposed to mean the recogmtion of gravity as a force acting
simply at a distance without mediation of intervening matter), had begun to

     If Le Sage      had but excepted Kepler's third law, it must be ad
mitted that his case, as stated above, would have been thoroughly
established by the arguments of his " memoire ;" for the epicurean
assumption of parallelism adopted to suit the false idea of the earth
being flat, prevented the discovery of the law of the inverse square
of the distance, which the mathematicians of that day were quite
competent to make, if the hypothesis of atoms moving in all
directions through space, and rarely coming into collision with one
another, had been set before them, with the problem of determin
ing the force with which the impacts would                    press  together two
spherical       bodies, such as the earth and moon were held to be by
some of the contemporary philosophers to whom the epicureant
 " would not listen." But
                                   nothing less than direct observation, prov
 ing Kepler's third law, — Galileo's experiment on bodies falling from
 the tower of Pisa, Boyle's guinea and feather experiment, and
 Newton's experiment of the vibrations of pendulums composed of
 different kinds of substance        — could give either the idea that gravity
 is proportional       to mass, or prove that       it is so to a high  degree of
 accuracy for large bodies and small bodies, and for bodies of dif
 ferent kinds of substance.           Le Sage sums up his theory in an ap
             to   the   " Lucrece Newtonien," part of which translated
 pendix
 (literally, except       a few sentences    which    I have paraphrased) is as
 follows   : —
                            Constitution of Heavy Bodies.
     1st, Their indivisible particles are cages; for example, empty
 cubes or octahedrons vacant         of matter except along the twelve edges.
     2d,  The diameters of the        bars  of these cages, supposed    increased
 each by an amount equal to the diameter                  of one  of the gravific
 corpuscles, are so small relatively to the             mutual distance of the
 parallel bars of each cage, that the terrestrial globe does not inter
 cept even       so much      as a ten-thousandth       part of the corpuscules
 which offer to traverse it.

580                  Proceedings      of the Royal Society
   3d, These diameters are          all equal, or  if  they are unequal, their
inequalities sensibly compensate one another [in averages].
                      Constitution of Gravific Corpuscules.
   1st,    Conformably     to the second     of the preceding     suppositions,
their diameters added to that of the bars is so small relatively                to
the mutual distance of parallel bars of one of the cages, that the
weights of the celestial bodies do not differ sensibly from being
in proportion to their masses.
   2d,    They    are isolated.    So that their progressive movements are
necessarily rectilinear.
   3d,    They    are so sparsely distributed,    that is to say, their dia
meters are so small relatively to their mean mutual distances, that
not more than one out           of every hundred of them meets another
corpuscule during several thousands of years. So that the unifor
mity of their movements is scarcely ever troubled sensibly.
   4th, They move along several hundred thousand millions of
different directions ; in counting for one same direction all those
which are [within a definite very small angle of being] parallel                 to
one straight line.        The distribution of these straight lines is to        be
conceived by imagining           as many points as one wishes to consider
of different directions, scattered        over a globe as uniformly as        pos
sible, and therefore separated from one another by at least a second
of angle      ;  and   then imagining      a radius   of the globe drawn         to
each    of  those points.
   5th, Parallel,      then, to each of those directions, let       a current    or
torrent of corpuscules move         ;  but, not to give the stream a greater
breadth than is necessary,          consider the transverse section of this
current to have the same boundary as the orthogonal projection of
the visible world on the plane          of the section.
   5th,    The different parts of       one such current     are sensibly equi-
 dense   ;  whether we compare, among one another, collateral portions
of sensible transverse dimensions, or            successive   portions of such
lengths that their times of passage              across   a given    surface   are
sensible.       And the   same is to be said   of the different currents     com
 pared with one another.
   7th,    The   mean velocities, defined in the same manner as            I have
just defined the densities,       are also sensibly equal.

   8th, The          ratios of these velocities to those of the planets are
several million times greater than the ratios of the gravities of the
planets towards the sun, to the greatest resistance which secular
observations allow us to suppose                      they experience.      For example,
[these velocities must be] some hundredfold a                          greater number of
times the velocity of the earth, than the ratio of 190,000* times
the gravity of the earth              towards the sun, to the greatest resistance
which secular observations of the length of the year permit                             us to
suppose that the earth experiences from the celestial masses.
CONCEPTION, which facilitates                     the   Application of Mathematics         to
  determine             the    mutual Influence of      these   Heavy Bodies and        these
  Vorpuscules.
  1st. Decompose all heavy bodies into molecules of equal mass, so
small that they may be treated as attractive points in respect to
theories in which gravity               is considered without            reference to its
cause      ;    that is to say, each must be so small that inequalities of
distance and differences of direction between its particles and those
of another molecule, conceived as attracting it and being attracted
by   it,
      may be neglected. For example, suppose the diameter of
the molecule considered to be                a    hundred thousand times smaller
than the distance between two bodies of which the mutual gravita
tion   is      examined, which would make its apparent semi-diameter,
as seen from the other body, about one second                        of angle.
  2d,          For the surfaces of such           a   molecule, accessible but imper
meable to the gravific fluid, substitute one single spherical                         surface
equal to their sum.
  3d,          Divide   those surfaces into facets small enough to allow them
to be treated as planes, without sensible error, [&c., &c.]
                                           Remarks.
  It    is       not necessary       to be very        skilful to    deduce      from these
suppositions all the laws of gravity, both sublunary and universal
(and consequently also those               of Kepler, &c.), with all the accuracy
which observed phenomena have proved                         those   laws.    Those laws,

therefore, are      inevitable    consequences of the supposed           consti
tutions.
    2d,   Although     I  here   present these    constitutions    crudely   and
without proof, as      if they were gratuitous hypotheses and hazarded
fictions, equitable readers       will understand that      on my own part       I
have at least some presumptions in their favour (independent of
their perfect agreement with so many phenomena), but that the
development of my reasons would be too long to find              a place  in  the
 present statement,       which may be regarded           as a publication      of
theorems without their demonstrations.
    3d,               There are details upon which      I have wished   to enter
on account       of the novelty    of the doctrine,   and which    will readily
be supplied by those         who study it in a favourable and attentive
spirit.     If  the authors who write on hydro-dynamics, aerostatics,
or optics, had to deal with captious readers, doubting the very exist
 ence of water, or air, or       light, and therefore not adapting them
 selves    to any tacit supposition       regarding    equivalencies    or com
 pensations not expressly mentioned in their treatises, they would
 be obliged to load their       definitions  with   a vast number     of specifi
 cations which instructed or indulgent            readers   do  not require of
 them.      One understands "d demi-mot" and " sano sensu" only
 familiar propositions        towards which      one   is already favourably
 inclined.
    Some      of the details referred to in this concluding sentence of
 the appendix to his
                           " Lucrece Newtonien," Le
                                                           Sage discusses fully
          "
 in his Traite de Physique Mecanique," edited by Pierre Prevost,
  and published in 1818 (Geneva and Paris).
     This treatise is divided into four books.

     It  is in the first two books      that gravity is explained by the im
  pulse of ultramundane corpuscules, and            I have no remarks at pre
  sent to make on the third and fourth books.

   From Le Sage's fundamental assumptions,                       given above as nearly
as may be in his own words, it as he says himself, easy to deduce
                                              is,
the law of the inverse square of the distance, and the law of pro
portionality of gravity to mass The object of the present note                              is
not to give an exposition of Le Sage's theory, which    sufficiently        is
set forth in the preceding extracts, and discussed in detail in the
first two books of his posthumous treatise.    may merely say that
                                                              I
inasmuch as the law of the inverse square of the distance, for every
distance, however great, would be                    a   perfectly obvious consequence
of the assumptions,          were the gravific corpuscules          infinitely small, and
therefore incapable of coming into collision                       with one another,        it
may be extended to as great distances as we please, by giving
small enough dimensions to the corpuscules relatively to the mean
distance of each from its nearest                     neighbour.     The law of       masses
may    be   extended to        as   great masses as those for which observation
proves    (for example the mass of Jupiter), by making the
            it
diameters of the bars of the supposed cage-atoms constituting heavy
bodies, small enough.               Thus, for example, there          is   nothing to pre
vent us from supposing that not more than one straight line of                               a
million drawn at random towards Jupiter and continued through
   should touch one of the bars.
 it,                                  Lastly, as Le Sage proves, the
resistance of his gravific fluid to the motion of one of the planets
through      it,   is   proportional to the product of the velocity of the
planet into the average velocity of the gravific corpuscules                           ;   and
hence by making the velocities of the corpuscules great enough,
and giving them              suitably small masses,            they may produce the
actual forces       of gravitation,           and     not more than the amount of
resistance       which observation allows us to suppose that the planets
experience.         It      will    be   a   very interesting       subject to examine
minutely Le Sage's details on these points, and to judge whether
or not the additional knowledge gained by observation since his
time requires any modification to be made in the estimate which he
has given        of the possible          degrees     of permeability of the sun and
planets, of the possible proportions of                   diameters of corpuscules to
interstices between them in the "gravific fluid," and of the possible
velocities of its component corpuscules.                        This much        is   certain,
that   if   hard indivisible             atoms      are granted at all, his principles
are unassailable        ;   and nothing       can be said       against the probability

584                 Proceedings         of the Boy al Society
of his assumptions.  The only imperfection of his theory is tha
which is inherent to every supposition of hard, indivisible atoms.
They must        be perfectly elastic or imperfectly elastic, or perfectly
inelastic.       Even   Newton    seems to have         admitted as a probable
reality hard, indivisible, unalterable atoms, each perfectly inelastic.
     Nicolas Fatio is quoted by Le Sage and Prevost, as a friend of
Newton, who in 1689 or 1690 had invented a theory of gravity
perfectly similar to that of Le Sage, except certain essential points;
had described it in a Latin poem not yet printed; and had written, on
the 30th March 1694, a letter regarding            it,   which    is   to be found in
the third volume of the works of Leibnitz, having been communi
cated for publication        to the editor of those works by               Le Sage.
Redeker,     a   German physician,        is   quoted by Le Sage           as having
expounded     a   theory of gravity of the same general character, in              a
Latin dissertation published in 1736, referring to which Prevost
      " Oil l'on trouve l'expose d'un systeme fort semblable celui
says,                                                                         a
" de Le Sage dans ses traits principaux, mais dépourvu de cette
" analyse    exacte des phenomenes qui fait        le   principal merite de toute
"    espece de theorie."      Fatio supposed the corpuscules to be elastic,
and seems to have shown no reason why their return velocities
after collision with mundane matter should be less than their pre
vious velocities, and therefore not to have explained gravity at all.
Redeker, we are told by Prevost, had very limited ideas of the per
meabilities of great bodies, and therefore failed to explain the law
of the proportionality of gravity to mass " he enunciated this law
                                                  ;
" very correctly in section 15 of his dissertation but the manner

" nise in this work an ingenious conception which ought to have

t *   Le Sago was remarkably scrupulous in giving full information regarding
11   who preceded him in the development of any part of his theory.

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                         585
     Le   Sage  shows     that to produce gravitation       those of the ultra
mundane corpuscules which strike the cage-bars of heavy bodies
must either stick there or go away with diminished velocities.
He     supposed      the   corpuscules to be inelastic       (dura), and points
out that      we ought not to suppose        them to be permanently lodged
in    the heavy body (entassis),       that we must rather suppose          them
to slip off ; but that being inelastic, their average velocities after
collision must be less than that which they had before collision.*
     That these suppositions imply a gradual diminution of gravity
from age to age was carefully pointed out by Le Sage, and referred to
 as an objection to his theory.        Thus    he says,   "...    Done, la duree
 "   de la gravite      seroit finie aussi, et par conssquent la duree du
     monde.
     "Reponse.      Concedo; mais pourvu que cet obstacle ne contribue
 " pas a faire finir le monde plus promptement qu'il n'auroit fini            sans
 " lui, il doit etre considere comme nul.".j.
     Two suppositions may         be made on the general basis of      Le  Sage's
 doctrine : —
     1st,   (Which seems to have been Le Sage's belief.) Suppose the
 whole of mundane matter to be contained within a finite space,
 and the infinite space round it to be traversed by ultramundane
corpuscules      ; and a small proportion        of the corpuscules coming
 from ultramundane space to suffer collisions with mundane matter,
 and get away with           diminished    gravific energy to ultramundane
 space again.       They would never return to the world            were   it not
 for collision     among themselves and other corpuscules.              Le   Sage
 held that such collisions       are extremely     rare ;  that each collision,
 even     between    the ultramundane      corpuscules themselves, destroys
 some      energy  ;J that at     a not  infinitely remote past time they
 were    set in motion for the purpose of keeping gravitation through

    t Newton (Optics, Query, 80 Edn. 1721, p. 373) held that two equal and
 similar atoms, moving with equal velocities in contrary directions, come to
 rest when they strike one another.      Le Sage held the same ; and it seems
 that writers of last century understood this without qualification when they
 called atoms hard.

both by their mutual collisions, and by collisions         with mundane
atoms, the whole stock      of gravific energy is being gradually re
duced,   and therefore the intensity of gravity gradually diminishing
from age to age.
   Or, 2d, suppose    mundane matter to be spread through        all space,
but to be much denser within each of an        infinitely great number of
finite volumes (such as the volume of the earth) than elsewhere.
On this supposition, even were there no collisions between              the
corpuscules themselves, there would be a gradual            diminution in
their gravific energy through the repeated collisions with       mundane
matter which each one must in the course of time suffer. The secular
diminution of gravity would be more rapid according to this sup
position than according to the former, but still might be made as
slow as we please by pushing far enough the fundamental assump
tions of very small diameters for the cage-bars of the mundane
atoms,    very great density for their       substance, and very     small
volume and mass, and very great velocity for the ultramundane
 corpuscules.
    The object of the present note is to remark that (even although
 we were to admit a gradual fading away of gravity, if slow enough),
 we are forbidden by the modern physical theory of the conservation
 of energy to assume inelasticity, or anything short of perfect elas
 ticity, in the ultimate molecules, whether of ultramundane or of
 mundane matter;       and,  at the same time, to point out that the
 assumption of diminished exit velocity of ultramundane corpuscules,
 essential to Le Sage's theory, may be explained for perfectly elastic
 atoms,   consistently both with modern thermodynamics,          and with
 perennial gravity.
    If the  gravific corpuscules leave   the earth or    Jupiter with less
 energy than they had before collision, their effect must be to con
 tinually   elevate the temperature throughout the whole mass.         The
 energy which must be attributed to the gravific corpuscules is so
 enormously great, that this       elevation  of temperature would      be
 sufficient   to melt  and   evaporate  any solid, great or small, in a
 fraction of    a second  of time.    Hence, though outward-bound cor
 puscules must travel with less velocity, they must carry away the
 same energy with them as they brought.           Suppose, now, the whole
 energy of the corpuscules approaching a planet to consist of trans

latory      motion    : a portion  of the energy of each corpuscule which
has       suffered collision     must be supposed to be converted by the
collision into vibrations, or vibrations and rotations.             To simplify
 ideas,     suppose for a moment the particles         to be perfectly smooth
 elastic globules.         Then collision could not generate any rotatory
 motion; but if the cage-atoms constituting mundane matter                    be
  each of them,         as we must suppose     it  to be, of enormously great
  mass in comparison with one of the ultramundane               globules, and  if
  the substance of the latter, though perfectly elastic,          be much less
  rigid than that of the former,         each globule that strikes one of the

  corresponding deficiency of energy altogether converted into vibra
   tion of its own       mass.   Thus the condition required by Le        Sage's
   theory is    fulfilled without violating modern thermo-dynamics ; and,
   according to Le Sage, we might be satisfied not to inquire what be
   comes of those ultramundane corpuscules which have been in collision
   either with the cage-bars of mundane matter or with             one another;
   for at present, and during       ages to come, these would be merely an
   inconsiderable       minority, the great majority being still fresh with
   original gravific energy unimpaired by collision.         Without entering
   on the purely metaphysical question, — Is any such supposition satis
    factory   ?  I wish   to point out how gravific energy may be naturally
   restored to corpuscules in which it has been impaired by collision.
        Clausius    has introduced     into the kinetic   theory of gases the
    very important       consideration of vibrational   and rotational energy.
    He has shown that a multitude             of elastic corpuscules moving
    through void, and occasionally striking one another, must, on the
    average, have a constant proportion of their whole energy in the
    form of vibrations and rotations, the other part being purely trans-
    lational.     Even for the simplest case, — that, namely, of smooth
     elastic globes, — no one has yet calculated by abstract dynamics
     the ultimate average ratio of the vibrational and rotational, to
     the translational energy.       But Clausius has shown       how to deduce
     it for the corpuscules of any particular gas from the experimental
     determination of the ratio of its specific heat pressure constant, to
     its specific heat volume constant.*        He found that

necessary        to complete Le Sage's theory of gravity in accordance
with modern science,                is   to assume         that the ratio of the whole
energy of the corpuscules to the translational part of their energy
is   greater,     on the average,          after collisions         with mundane matter
than after inter-collisions              of only ultramundane corpuscules.       This
supposition         is   neither more nor less              questionable than that of
Clausius for gases which              is   now admitted as one of the generally
recognised truths of science.          The corpuscular theory of gravity is
no more         difficult in allowance of its fundamental assumptions than
the kinetic theory of gases as at present received                           ;     and   it   is   more
complete, inasmuch as, from fundamental                             assumptions of             an ex
tremely simple character,             it   explains all the known phenomena of
its subject, which cannot be said of the kinetic theory of gases so
far as     it   has hitherto advanced.

     In    the preceding statement           I      inadvertently omitted to remark
that   if   the constituent atoms are aeolotropic in respect to perme
ability,     crystals would generally have different permeabilities                                     in
different directions,           and would therefore have                 different            weights
according to the direction of their axes relatively to the direction
of gravity.         No such difference              has    been     discovered, and                it   is

  certain that if there         is any    it is extremely small.       Hence, the
 constituent      atoms,    if  aeolotropic as "to permeability,      must be so,
 but to     an exceedingly         small degree.       Le Sage's second funda
 mental assumption given above, under the title " Constitution of
 " Heavy Bodies," implies sensibly equal permeability in all direc
 tions, even in an aeolotropic structure, unless much greater than
 Jupiter, provided that the         atoms are isotropic as to permeability.
     A  body having        different permeabilities       in different directions
 would,   if of   manageable dimensions, give us            a  means for drawing
 energy from the inexhaustible              store laid up in the ultramundane

 corpuscles, thus : First, turn the body into a position of minimum
 weight; Secondly, lift it through any height; Thirdly, turn it
 into a position of maximum weight; Fourthly, let it down to its
 primitive level. It is easily seen that the first and third of those
 operations are performed without the expenditure of work                ;  and, on
 the whole, work is done by gravity                 in operations   2 and 4.     In
 the corresponding         set  of operations performed upon a moveable
 body in the neighbourhood of a fixed magnet, as much work is
 required for operations         1 and  3 as   is gained in operations   2 and 4 ;
the magnetisation of the moveable body being either intrinsic or
inductive, or partly intrinsic and partly inductive, and the part of
its aeolotropy     (if  any), which depends on inductive magnetisation,
being due either to magne-crystallic              quality of its substance,   or to
its shape.*

                                  Professor Tait.
    For    some time back       I  have been endeavouring       to prove, by ex
periment, through great ranges of temperature, the result announced
by    me in December last, viz., that the electro-motive               force of a
thermo-electric        circuit is in general, unless the temperature be very
high,     a parabolic function       of the absolute temperature of either
junction, that of the other being maintained constant.
    For     moderate     ranges of temperature the experiment presents
little difficulty    ;  but, when mercurial thermometers cannot be em
ployed, a modification         of the experimental method must            be made.
I   have employed in succession several such modifications, of which
the following are the chief : —
    The simplest of all is       to dispense altogether    with thermometers,
and to employ two thermo-electric              circuits, whose    hot and whose
cold junctions are immersed in the same vessels               ; and   to plot the
curve whose abscissae and ordinates are simultaneous readings of
 the electro-motive forces in the two circuits.           In   every case    I have
 tried the curve thus obtained is almost accurately a parabola, most of
 the few deviations yet observed being           in the case  of silver and other
 metals at temperatures not very much below their melting points —
 under circumstances, in fact, in which we should naturally expect
 that the law would no longer hold.            There are, also, cases in which
 the whole electro-motive force is so small, even for very large differ
 ences    of temperature, that very much        more delicate apparatus would
 be required for their proper investigation.            And   there are cases in
 which the neutral point is so far off that for moderate                 ranges of
 temperature the curves obtained              are sensibly    straight    lines.   I
 intend to examine these cases          with care — the former by using        more
 delicate galvanometers        ;  the latter, by employing metals which are
 practically     infusible.     The difficulty    of obtaining     wires of such
 metals has been        the chief one I have     had to face.
    If we    assume the experimental curve to be a parabola,            then it is
 easily seen (Proc. May 29, 1871) that in each circuit the electro
 motive force must be a parabolic function of some function of the ab
 solute    temperatures of the junctions.           And,  as in the iron-silver,

 598                    Proceedings of             the   Royal Society
 iron-zinc, iron copper, iron-cadmium, &c., circuits, this function                               has
been proved to be simply the absolute temperature itself (at least,
within the range of mercury thermometers), it is probable that such
is the general law, at least for ranges of temperature short of those
which materially alter the molecular structure of the metals em
ployed.
   The second method consisted in employing two pairs of circuits,
all four hot junctions being in the same heated substance, and all
four cold junctions kept at a common temperature.                              The members
of each pair         acted             galvanometer (as explained in
                             on a differential
Proc. Dec. 19, 1870) in such a way as to eliminate the term containing
the square of the absolute temperature. In this case the readings of
the galvanometers should be simply proportional                             to one another,
and likewise to the differences of absolute temperature of the junc
tions.   The method is exact in theory, but by no means easy in
practice, especially with the very limited number of metals capable
of resisting a high temperature which I could manage to obtain.
That     a very exact and useful                   thermometric      arrangement can be
made on this principle admits of no doubt, when we examine the
results of the experiments.
   The third method consisted in assuming the parabolic law, and
the following consequence                 of it which follows directly by                 the use
of Thomson's general                formulae.        These may easily be reproduced
as follows      :   — Suppose   a  sliding ring or clip to be passed round                        the
wires, so as to press           together points of the wires which are at                         the
same temperature, t.               Its effects     are known by experiment to be nil,
whatever be its material.                Let it    be slid along so that the tempera
ture of what is now effectively the hot junction becomes t +                               St,   then
the two laws of thermodynamics give, respectively,

the current, and are the only sensible thermal effects when a                                  very

     The two oblique straight lines in the diagram belong to the metals
a,   b, respectively. The tangents of their inclination to the horizontal
axis (the line of the supposed metal for which k = 0) are ka, kb — and
they cut it at the points Ta, T4, where they are neutral to it ; cut
ting one another at a point A whose abscissa is their own neutral
point     Ta(l. The only change which would            be introduced, by taking
 as   horizontal axis the line corresponding            to a metal for which k
 does not vanish, would         be   a   dislocation     of the diagram, by a
 simple shear.       This follows at      once    from the equation of one of
 the lines —
                                y=*„0-Ta).
     The diagram gives the Peltier         effect   at the junction of a and    6
 for any temperature      <„ by drawing the ordinate at tv and completing
 a rectangle cc'gf on the part intercepted, its opposite end being at
 absolute zero.      The   area of this rectangle is to      be taken positively
 or negatively according as the corner corresponding to a is nearer
 to,   or further   from, the horizontal       axis than that corresponding
 to b, the current being supposed          to pass from a to b.
     The electro-motive force in       a  circuit of the two metals,    a and b,
 with    its junctions at       and    <2  respectively, is found by drawing
 ordinates at these temperatures, so as to cut off triangular spaces
 Acc', Add', whose vertices are at the neutral point.             The difference

602                        Proceedings          of the Royal Society
of the      areas     of   these    spaces,      cdd'c',         is proportional      to the electro
motive force.              When the higher temperature,                          tv is above the neu-
tral point, the electromotive force is the difference of the areas                                Aee',
Aee'.       The       case      above       mentioned,            in which, by a differential
galvanometer, we get rid of the terms in                              <2,   is   obviously a process
for making the curves of two separate complex arrangements into
parallel straight lines.
     In   conclusion,      I     may give       a       few instances of the comparison of
results of calculation              of      the neutral point             of two metals from      their
observed       neutral points, and differences of                         k,   as regards iron, with
calculation of the same neutral point from the portion of the curve
(assumed       to be       a    parabola) which expresses                       their electro- motive
force     within ranges of temperature where mercurial                                 thermometers
can be applied.
     Thus with Fe, Cd, Pb,                  we have          from the iron circuits 0-00112
 -   0-00209      =    -    0-00097, while the direct experiment with Cd, Pb
gave      - 0-00096.
     The neutral           point,       as calculated            from the data for the iron
circuits    is   - 69° C,        while the calculation                from direct experiment
gives     -74°C.
     When the quantities to be found are very small, as for instance
in the case Ag         - Cu, we cannot              expect to get           a   good approximation
by introducing             a   third metal.             In    fact, introducing          Fe   we find
indirectly     0    00147       -   0   00151       =    -   0   00004,     while    the direct    de
termination gives              - 0-00006.
     Again with Zn             and Cu, indirectly             we get
                                    -   0   00042 and         - 144' C.
Directly                            -   0   00048 and         - 146° C.
  Several of the other groups give results as closely agreeing with
one another as these, others are considerably out.
   The numerical determinations above are founded entirely on                                          a
series of experiments made for me by Messrs J. Murray and R. M.
Morrison.    Mr W. Durham        at present engaged in determining
                                               is
the electromotive force of contact of wires of the same metal                                       at
different temperatures, with the view of inquiring into its relation                                to
ordinary thermo-electric phenomena which appears to be                                     suggested
by some of the formulae above given.

    The following Communications             were read  : —
1. On the     Relation of Magnetism to Temperature.               (With
    a Plate.) By D. H. Marshall, Esq., M.A., Assistant to the
    Professor of Natural Philosophy. Communicated by Pro
    fessor Tait.
   The following      was the arrangement      adopted in these   experi
ments:   — A large magnet      was put into a copper pot containing   oil,
which was heated up by       a brass  Bunsen, and its temperature deter
mined by a mercurial      thermometer immersed in it.        The magnet
was set magnetically        east  and west,   and placed so as to act
with equal force      on the poles of a small magnet, whose        centre
was    in the prolongation      of its axis.    This small magnet     was
cemented to the back of a small concave mirror, suspended            by a
single silk fibre, and placed in a glass case to guard it against cur
rents of air.   The deflections of the small magnet        were measured
exactly as in the reflecting galvanometer, and since from the nature
of the arrangement, the absolute magnetism in the large magnet is
directly as the tangent of the angle of deflection of the small one,
its amount for any temperature was immediately measured           by the
reading on the scale.

   [This simple formula holds, of course, however complex be the
distribution of magnetism in the large magnet, provided the rela
tive intensities of magnetization at different parts, and their direc
tions, remain unchanged by heating.]
  Disturbances were experienced                   in the form of thermo-electric
currents in the pot and brass ring supporting it (these acted against
one another), but their effects were rendered insignificant by remov
ing the     flame, and allowing          the whole to come to a uniform                         tem
perature before reading.             The direction of          these currents, and there
fore that of the disturbance to which they gave rise, could                                   be re
versed by changing the position              of the flame relatively to                   the pot         ;
but a smaller disturbance of a more unaccountable nature presented
itself during the heating of the pot, which did not depend on the
position of the flame, and could not be got rid of. This latter
disturbance, which increased with the temperature, resulted in                                            a
gradual alteration of zero, and in consequence                           the deflections, cor
responding at least to the higher temperatures in the curves                                        and
all the ordinates of          the lower part   of curve         III.,     are somewhat less
than they ought strictly to be.
  Curves       I.,   II.,   and the upper part of curve                  III.,     show how         the
absolute magnetism diminishes               as tho temperature of the magnet
increases   ;   the lower part of curve            III.    shows how the magnet                      re
gains its power when the temperature again falls, and                               it   is   seen    at
once from       it   that, when the magnet          is     allowed to cool after being
heated, the deflection corresponding                  to   a   given temperature               is   less
than that obtained at the same temperature when the magnet                                            is
being heated, thus indicating              a   loss    of magnetic               power,    and       the
difference of the two deflections            is   greater the lower the tempera
ture.     It   is   principally     on this account also that the curves                      I.     and
II.   do not coincide, for the experiments were performed on succes
sive days, and        it    was found that that magnet took about two days
after such heating to acquire its original power.                          The magnet            ueed

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                                          605
in the experiments represented by curves I. and II.                            was not the
same as the one used in that represented by curve                       III.   ;   the latter
was a thin, very hard steel magnet, the former thicker and softer,
and it may be seen from the curves that the hard steel parted with
its magnetism       less readily than the soft.
    From    these experiments        it follows      also that       -^p,   or the rate       of
change of magnetism with temperature,                    is   not constant for each
temperature, but depends            in   some way or other upon the state                      of
the magnet.
    When    the above experiment was repeated with an electro-magnet
in the copper pot instead of permanent magnet,
                                     a           was found that      it
while at    temperature of 500c F. the power of the permanent
            a
magnet     is   very much lessened, that of the electro-magnet, provided
the intensity of the current remain constant,                 is   unaltered.
           2.    Note on   a   Singular Property of the Retina.
                               By Professor Tait.
    While suffering      some      of the annoyances seemingly inseparable
from re-vaccination at too advanced an age,              I      was led to the curious
observation presently to be described.                I   was unable to sleep, ex
        " short and far                     "
cept in                         between         dozes, from which           I      woke with
a   sudden start, my eyelids opening fully.               I       found by trial that
this   state     of things     became     somewhat       less      intolerable       when    I
lay on my back, with             my head considerably              elevated.            In   this
position I      directly faced a gas jet, burning not very brightly, placed
close to   a    whitish wall, and surrounded by               a   ground glass shade,
through which the flame could be prominently                           perceived.            The
portions of the wall surrounding                the burner were moderately illu
minated, and hyperbolic portions above and below somewhat more
strongly.   I      observed,   on waking, that the            gas flame seemed for
a second or two to be surrounded by              a   dark crimson ground, though
itself apparently unchanged in colour. Gradually, after the lapse
of, at the very utmost,  couple of seconds, everything resumed its
                               a
normal appearance.     As this phenomenon appeared not only to be
worthy of observation in itself, but to furnish me with something
definite to reflect upon, which   far the best alleviation of annoy-
                                          is

ances similar to those               from which       I   was suffering,      I   determined    to
watch       it,   transitory as         it   was, feeling      assured thatI       should   have
many opportunities of observing it.    After two nights' practice,                             I
found myself getting  dangerously   skilful in reproducing       and                     it,
decided, somewhat reluctantly, that      must give    up. I What            it                 I
observed,         however, has already been almost completely                         described
as having been seen on the very first occasion.                           I   endeavoured       to
prepare      myself to note any possible difference of colour in                      the   crim
son field, as distinguished                  from mere difference of intensity          of illu
mination,          and   I    could          perceive none.      I     also endeavoured         to
ascertain the nature of the transition from this state to the normal
one, but this was so exceedingly rapid that                      I     could form no conclu
sion, and     I      found that under the necessary circumstances                        of the
observation, viz., as           it   could be made only at the instant of awaken
ing,   it   was impossible for me to estimate, even approximately,                             the
duration of the crimson appearance.
     Several possible           modes         of explaining      the phenomenon at once
occurred to me.               Of    these,       however, I      shall mention but three,
and give reasons              for rejecting two of them, while not pretending
to specify          them       in the order in which they occurred to me.
It     cannot be ascribed to any visual defects                          in my eyes, which
are normal as to colour                       sensations, and very perfect optically.
1st, I   imagined        it   might be due to light passing through the almost
closed eyelid, or through              portion of the eyeball temporarily filled
                                             a
with     blood.          Besides feeling           certain      that   my eyes were         fully
open,  I   had the additional argument against this explanation, that
I    could not reproduce the phenomenon by carefully and gradually
closing them, and that     am not aware that an effusion of blood
                                     I
in any part of the eye could possibly disappear so rapidly.      2d,
It might be due to diffraction either by my eyelashes or by small

                                   is
that the colour            is   not one which can be produced by diffraction
under such circumstances, and that                        it   appeared    to be the same on
the more illuminated,                   as   well as on the darker part of the field.

3d,   I suggest, as a possible explanation, but one which is more
specially in the province of the physiologist              than of the natural
philosopher, that the retina (or the nerve cells connected with it?)
partakes of sleep with the other nerve cells, by which that pheno
menon has been accounted for, and that on                a sudden    awakening,
the portions connected with the lowest of the primary                  forms of
 colour are the first to come into action, the others coming into
 play somewhat later, and almost             simultaneously.        This  would
 completely     account for the peculiar        crimson colour, and for its
 uniformity of tint over the whole field, excepting the gas flame
itself, the comparative intensity of whose light may easily be sup
 posed to have simultaneously aroused all the three sensations in the
 small portion of the retina on which it fell, though it is just pos
sible that it also may have appeared            crimson for an exceedingly
short period.      I am not aware     of any experiments or observations
having    been     made   with reference to the subject of this note,
 and  I  hope    to have no further opportunities         of making them,     at
least in the way in which          these    were made, but the point       is a
 curious one, and worthy of the careful attention            of all who may be
 forced to consider it.      Professor Clerk-Maxwell informs me that
 he and others have observed that the lowest          of the three colour  sen
sations is the first to evanesce with faintness of light, and that it
has   been    asserted  to be the most sluggish        in responding to the
sudden appearance of light.         This, however, is not necessarily anta
gonistic   to my explanation, but will rather,          if  my explanation be
correct, tend to show a greater interval           between    the awakening  of
 the red, and that of the other colour sensations than that above
 hinted at.

    By combining,      as above,  Hamilton's linear and vector-function
with his celebrated vector square-root of the negative of Laplace's
operator,   an operator of great use in physical applications of mathe
matics is obtained.       With   the notation      employed in the author's

                         papers

are to  certain extent indicated in Tait and Steele's Dynamics of a

first   to the second.               It   suggested          to me the          following theorem,
which really involves Mr Sang's results, but which appears to be
considerably simpler in treatment, this being my sole reason
for bringing it before the Society.
   Let DM be a horizontal line, and let DA be taken equal to the
tangent from D to the circle BPC, whose centre C is vertically under
D. Also let PAQ be any line through A, cutting in Q the semi
circle on AC.    Also make E the image of A in DM. Then if P
move with velocity due to DM, Q moves with velocity due to the
level of E ; so that we have the means of comparing, arc for arc,
two different continuous forms of pendulum motion, in one of which
the rotation takes place in half the time of that in the other.

                                           (Abslraet.y
      The principles       set forth        in this paper,                 though now (with the
 exception of the first theorem) published                                for the first time, were
 communicated to the French Academy of Sciences fifteen years
 ago,     in   a   memoir entitled          "      de       l'Equilibre interieur d'un Corps
 solide, elastique, et homogene,"                            and     marked        with     the motto,
 " Obvia conspicimus, nubem pellente Mathesi," the receipt of which
is  acknowledged in the Comples Rendus of the Gth April 18o7
 (vol. xliv. p. 706.)
    The author quotes         a     theorem discovered by him, and previously
 published         in the Philosophical Magazine for December 1855,
 called " the        Principle of Isorrhopic Axes," viz., " Every self

(312                Proceedings of       the  Royal Society
balanced    system of forces applied to         a  connected system of points,
is capable    of resolution into three rectangular systems of parallel
self-balanced forces applied to the same points."
    Let X, &c.,    be the forces resolved parallel            to any three ortho
gonal axes; find the six sums or integrals, 2Xx, 2Yy, 2Zz,                  2Yi    =
SZi/, 2£c     =  2Xz, 2Xy      =  2Ys ;   these    are   called the " rhopimetric
coefficients."      Conceive the ellipsoid        of  whose     equation these are
the coefficients    ;   then for the three axes of that ellipsoid            (called
the
      " isorrhopic             each   of the last three coefficients is null
                       axes")                                                        ;
and the three systems         of  forces parallel respectively to those three
axes are separately self-balanced.
    The   theorem      may be extended to systems of moving masses by
 putting    X-m-^-,
                   <Px
                           &c., instead of X, &c.           If  for any system of
 forces, the last three rhopimetric coefficients are null, and the first
 three equal to each other, every direction             has the properties of an
 isorrhopic axis.        This,  of  course,  includes      the case in which all
 the coefficients are null ; and in that case the system of forces is
 said to be " Arrhopic."         The author shows that the six rhopimetric
 coefficients of a system of forces         externally       applied to an elastic
 solid, being divided         by the volume of the solid, give the mean
 values throughout the solid of the six elementary stresses.                  Those
 are called the
                   " Homalotatic stresses."
     If we calculate from them the corresponding externally applied
                                             ''
 pressures, these may be called the              Homalotatic pressures."
     Take away the homalotatic pressures              from the actual system of
  externally     applied    pressures,   and    the residual      pressures will   be
 arrhopic   ;  that is to say, their components parallel to any direction
 whatsoever will be separately self-balanced, and may have                     their
 straining    effects    on the solid separately determined            ; and hence,
 the axes     to which      those residual pressures          are  reduced  may be
  arbitrarily chosen, with       a view to convenience           in the solution of
  problems.
     The author then demonstrates that               those     problems respecting
  the distribution     of stress in an elastic solid, in which the stresses
  are expressed     by constants and by linear functions of the co-ordi
  nates, are all capable      of solution independently of the coefficients
  of elasticity of    the substance.

      7.   On        a   Singular Case of Rectification in Lines of the
                         Fourth Order. By Edward Sang, Esq.
    The     class of curves resulting from the formula
                                      x = a         .   sin   6 ,   y   =    b .   sin    2 0
are  of considerable interest as occurring in various mechanical in
quiries.   When a straight wire, whose effective breadth and thick
ness are as two to one, is fixed at one end and made to vibrate, its
free end describes                    a curve           of which the general equation is
                              x   =       a   .   sin (6 + k)           ,   y    =    b .   sin   2 6 ,
in which k is constant for the particular variety of curve.                                                             When
k           -^-ir
    .—              the curve becomes                       a   parabola, and when                      k   =   o,   it   takes
the form above mentioned                                ;   these       phases were exhibited                       by me in
1832.        Again, when                  a       system        of toothed wheels                  is   deduced from           a
straight rack, having                         a    curve of sines for its outline, the points of
contact describe a curve of this class, as                                         is    shown in my treatise on
the teeth of wheels.
    In attempting the rectification of                                       these curves, we have to inte
grate an expression of the general form
                             di   =
                                      {

and for this purpose                          have       to expand the root in                          an interminate
series, and then integrate                               each term, the result being unmanage
able from its complexity.                                In     one particular                  phase       of the      curve,
however,            the integration can be easily effected.                                       The       above general
expression may be written
           dl       =

and we readily observe                             that       if   a*   =    32      V,   that    is,if     a   =   4

  whence,     on integrating,    we at once obtain
                                                          =

  The expression for the radius of curvature also takes                     a very simple
  form, it is
                                ~
                                     b   (cos 2 6 + 2)»
                                   \/2            sin   0
  No other curve of this class, nor indeed any belonging to the more
  general formula
                   x = a   . sin (p  6 +   k)    ,  y   =   b.  sin  (j 0)  ,
 seems to be susceptible of easy rectification.
     These results may be exhibited                 geometrically         thus: — Having
 drawn OA, OB in the directions of the length and breadth of the
 curve, and described round O a circle with the radius OB                           =  OC
  =   b,  let OA. be made equal to four times CB, and an hour-glass
  curve be constructed         in the usual manner.                   Then,    having   as
 sumed any arc       CD   to represent b      . 2 6     and drawn       DFQ parallel     to
 OA,     if FP   be laid off equal to a     .   sin   6,  P    is a point in the curve,
 and the length from         0  to  P is equal       to the sum of OF, and twice
 the arc CD.
    Hence it follows that the portion            PQ of the curve, cut off by           the
 line DQ, is just double of the circular arc DBE, cut off by the                     same
 line.
    Hence it appears that the length of the quadrant                       OPQA of     the
curve is just equal to the circumference                  of the circle, or that       the
whole curve is equal in length to four times the circumference                           of
the circle described with the radius OB.

2.   Notice     of a New Family of the Echinodermata.                    By
    Professor Wyville Thomson, LL.D., F.R.SS.L. and E.,
    F.L.S., F.G.S.
    During     the   deep    sea   dredging    expedition  of H.M.     ships
'Lightning'       and 'Porcupine,'       in the summers of 1868-69 and
 1870, two or three nearly perfect specimens, and a number of frag
 ments were procured of three species of regular echinideans, which
 were referred by the author to a new family, the Echinothuridae,
 intermediate     in  their   more     essential  characters  between    the
 Cidaridae   and the Diadematidae.
    In  these urchins the test is circular and greatly depressed.       The
 plates of the perisom are long and strap-shaped, and            the iuter-
 ambulacral plates overlap one another regularly           from the apical
 towards the oral poll, while        the ambulacral    plates overlap in   a
 similar way in the opposite direction.          The test is thus flexible.
 The plates of the ambulacral        areae are essentially within the iutei-
 ambulacral plates which         over-lie them along their outer      edged.
 The ambulacral pores are tri-gprainal. arranged in wide arcs; the

    616               Proceedings     of the Ro yal     Sociei. y
    two pairs of pores of each arc which are nearest the centre               of the
    ambulacral area, pierce two small accessory plates intercalated be
    tween the ambulacral plates,       while the outer pair passes through
   the ambulacral plate itself near its outer extremity.                  The tube-
   feet on the oral surface of the body are             provided with terminal
   suckers, supported by calcareous rosettes, while those on the apical
   surface are conical and simple.            The tube-feet      on both surfaces
   have their walls supported by wide cribriform             calcareous plates.
      The peristome and the periproct are unusually large.                 The edge
   of the peristome is entire, without branchial notches, and the
   peristomial membrane is uniformly plated with twenty rows of
   imbricating    scales, corresponding      with the rows of plates of the
   corona, and the rows    of ambulacral tube-feet       are continued as      in  the
  Cidaridae,  over the peristome up to the edge of the mouth.                     The
  ovarial plates are unusually large;         in some    of the   species   they are
  broken up into several calcareous pieces.               The ovarial apertures
  are very large, and are partly filled up with membrane.
      The dental pyramid is wide and strong, but somewhat low on
  account of the depressed       form of the test.       The epiphyses of          the
  tooth-sockets do not form closed arches as in the Echinidae, and in
  this respect    resemble   those    of Cidaris    and Diadema.         The    teeth
  are simply grooved as in Cidaris.           The spines     are hollow and com
  paratively small, and the larger spines show          a  tendency to the spiral
  arrangement of projecting teeth which is so characteristic                  of   the
  Diadematidee.       The Pedicellariffi     are   very remarkable         in   form,
 more    nearly related, however, to those of the Diadematids than
 to any others.      A strong fenestrated fascia traverses the body cavity
 vertically    on   either side of each        ambulacral      area,  thus    nearly
 cutting off the ambulacral        from the inter-ambulacral           region, and
 allowing only a small space for the coils of the intestine.
     For this family, distinguished by the depressed corona of imbri
 cated plates, the peristome covered with scales through which the
 rows of ambulacral double-pores are continued to the mouth, the
 absence     of branchial      notches     in   the peristomial       border,     tbe
peculiar arrangement of the ambulacral pores, the heterogeneity of
the tube-feet on the oral and apical surfaces, the absence of closed
arches uniting        the  pairs   of   tooth -sockets,    and the absence of
longitudinal     ridges within      the   simple    grooved teeth, the term

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                        617
Echinotkuridae       was proposed,     the fossil-genus    Echinothuria,   saga
ciously described by the late          S.  P. Woodward, from      an imperfect
specimen from the upper chalk               being taken as the type.        The
specimens procured        were referred to two genera and three species.
     In   the  genus Phormosoma           the plates   of the perisom only
slightly overlap,      and  fit so closely as to form a complete calcareous
casing without any membranous fenestrae. Although constructed
essentially on the same plan, the apical and oral surfaces of the
test differ from one another singularly in character, the oral sur
 face being almost uniformly covered with large areolar depressions
surrounding spine tubercles.
     One species, Phormosoma placenta, n. sp.,          was dredged in deep
 water off the Butt of the          Lews,    and some fragments were met
 with in gravel from the Rockall Channel.
    In the genus Calveria, the plates of both             the ambulacral     and
 inter-ambulacral      areas form large expansions        towards the middle
 line of the   area, while the outer portions of the plates are narrow
 and strap-shaped, leaving large fenestras filled up with membrane
 between plate and plate.         The oral surface of the body        does   not
 differ markedly in character from the apical.
    Two     species   of this genus were taken, Calveria hystrix, n. sp.,
 with a strong perisom, of a nearly uniform rich claret colour, from
 deep water off the Butt of the Lews ; and Calveria fenestrata, n. sp.,
 more delicate, with wider spaces between the plates, the body of a
 greyish colour, rayed from the apical pole with bright chocolate.
    It  is very possible that the genus Asthenosoma,             described    by
 Professor Grube, may belong to this group, but the description of
 that form hitherto given is not sufficient for identification, as the
 points of structure on which the families of the Echinidea            are dis
 tinguished from one another are not noticed.           With this exception,
the form which most nearly resembles              them is Astropyga, which,
however, is     in  every respect, except     in habit, a true Diadema, with
the peristomial margin deeply notched for external             branchiae,   and
all the other characters of the family.

3.    On the Principles which regulate the Incidence of Taxes.
                             By Professor Fleeming Jenkin.
     It   is well known that many taxes do not fall ultimately                              on the
person from whom they are in the first instance levied.                                   The   mer
chant advances               the duties imposed on goods,                    but the tax ulti
mately falls            on the consumer.               The problem of discovering                the
ultimate or true incidence of each tax is one of great importance,
and      of considerable complexity.                   The following        paper   contains      an
investigation of the methods by which this incidence may in some
cases be experimentally                    determined, and of the principles regulat
ing      the incidence            in all   cases, these        principles    being stated in          a
mathematical form.
   The author, in a paper published in Recess Studies, expressed
the law of supply and demand by representing what may be
termed       the demand and supply functions, as curves.                              The ordi-
nates       parallel         to     the     axis     OX, fig.      1, were     prices — the co
ordinates            parallel      to   the axis      OY       were   the supplies        at each
price, and the demand at each price for the respective curves — the
market price is then indicated by the ordinate                               X of   the    point at
which       the curves intersect, this being the only price at which
buyers and sellers are agreed as to the quantity to be transferred.
     We might write the law algebraically                          as follows,     calling y    the
quantity of goods in the market, at each price x, we have y = p x                                     ;
and      calling yl the quantity of goods demanded                           at each price, we
have       yl =    the market price is determined by the equation
y    =    yr There   however, little or no advantage in adopting this
                             is,
algebraic form, because we cannot suppose                              that in any instance
<p   x or   Pi   x   will   be any tolerably simple algebraic function, whereas
the curve for given goods might be determined experimentally                                      by
observing from year to year variations                             of quantities bought          or
quantities supplied at various prices.
     Professor Jevons has since given                      a   much more complex algebraic
representation of the same law, which, however, reduces itself to
the above simple form.
     The graphic method may                         also   be employed        to    indicate    the
advantage gained by each party in trade, and to show how                                   it   may
be estimated in money.                     Let     the two curves      indicate the demand

and    supply at each price for a certain kind of goods.           If all sellers
were of one mind, and were willing to supply all their goods at
a given price      x, and were quite determined to sell no goods below
that    price, the supply curve would      be  a mere    straight line parallel
to   OX, and ending abruptly at the ordinate raised at x. Similarly,
if   all buyers were of one mind, and would only buy below a given
price x, but were willing to buy all they want at that price, and no
 more at any lower price, the demand curve would              be a line parallel
 to OX ending abruptly       at the ordinate raised at x, and the price
 would    be quite indeterminate.       If the  two lines overlapped, trans
 actions    might take place     at any price between        that at which the
     Y
                                                                                 X

 selters  were   willing to sell  and the buyers      willing to buy ; there
 would in this case be no market price.           This case does not repre
 sent   the true state   of either buyers' or sellers' minds in any real
 large market.      There are always a few holders who would only sell         if
 the price were     much higher than the market price, — these          are the
 people who expect prices to rise    ; there are some who are just willing
 to sell at the market price, but who      will not sell  a penny below; and
 there are others, weak holders, who expect prices to fall, and these
 would really,    if pushed to extremity, sell below the market price.
 This condition of things is    represented    by the supply curve in fig.     1.

620                  Proceedings          of the Royal Society
     Similarly,    there    are a few buyers who,          if pushed    to extremity,
would buy some goods               above      market price   ;   some also will just
buy at market price         ;   some   will not buy unless        the price is below
market price.         This is represented by the demand curve.
     Now,    I   contend that when the market price is fixed, those
traders who are perfectly indifferent               whether they buy or sell at
that price reap no benefit by the trade                ;   but these    will   be few   in
number.
     Looking     at the demand curve, the  ordinate XA from the axis OY
to A represents       the value set on some of the goods by some buyers,
but these buyers have got the goods for the sum represented by
the ordinate x = OM ; the difference between these two ordinates
XA   —   x is the difference in price between          what was given and what
might have been given for a certain small quantity &y of goods.
&y is therefore the benefit reaped                 by buyers from the purchase
of the quantity &y; and integrating the benefits derived from the
sale of each successive    quantity, we find the area MDCBAN
represents the whole gain to buyers by the purchase of the quantity
y of goods.         Similarly, it is       easy to show that the area          MDciaP
represents       the gain to sellers by the same transaction            ;   these   areas
represent the gain in money.       Each product A#(x          being     —
the product of a quantity by the gain in money per unit of quantity.
     Thus the whole benefit         to the two leading communities is repre
sented by the sum of the two above named areas, and the reparti
tion     of the benefit         between     the two communities             is perfectly
definite.
     Professor Jevons has used curves to integrate what he terms the
utility gained by exchange in a manner analogous to the above ;
but utility, as he defines  admits of no practical measurement,
                                    it,
and he bases his curve, not on the varying estimates of value set
by different individuals          each on what he has or what he wants, but
on     the varying     utility to      each    individual of     each   increment       of
goods.      The    above estimate of the gain due to trade, deduced                 from
the demand and supply curves as originally drawn in my Recess
Studies' article      is,
                       I    believe, novel, and gives        a   numerical estimate
in money of the value of any given trade, which might                       be approxi
mately determined by observing the effect of change of prices on
                                                             a

tainly      not,      in    most cases,         be    determined        by experiment,             but
statistics gathered through                  a few years would show approximately
the     steepness      of   each curve near the market price, and this is the
most important information.
   A     steep      supply curve and a horizontal                 demand curve indicate
that    the buyers reap the chief benefit of the trade.                          The sellers,         if
producers,         may, however, be making important profits as capitalists
and labourers.
    A   steep demand curve and a level supply curve indicate that the
suppliers          are chiefly      benefited        by the trade   ;    the community              or
body which is most ready to abandon the trade if the price in
creases a little, benefits least by the trade.
   When the traders are producers and consumers, the benefits
estimated in this way as due to the trade are not the only benefits
reaped by the community from the manufacture.
   In this         case, what is termed the              supply curve depends on the
cost of production of the article, including that interest on capital
and that remuneration for skilled superintendence which                                   is neces
 sary to induce the producer to employ his capital and skill in that
 way.       The cost of production increases generally with the quantity
 of the article produced, otherwise the supply curve would be                             a   straight
 vertical line; but as a matter of fact, to produce an increase of
 production a rise of price is necessary,                  indicating          that only a few
 men with little capital are content with a small rate of interest and
 small remuneration                for their skill, but that to induce many men
 and much capital to be employed in the particular                              manufacture,          a
 large rate        of interest and considerable remuneration                      are required,
 hence the supply curve will be such as shown in fig. 2, where the
 price OP is that price or cost of production which is just sufficient
 to tempt a few producers to produce a                    little of the article.
    Then        if OP'     is the actual cost out of pocket required to produce
 a small        quantity     of    an    article, and     if OP     is the lowest cost at
 which any manufacturer can afford to produce                           it,   the area        P'D'DM
 represents the whole profit to the producing capitalist when the
 price    OM. The line D'P'
           is                      not necessarily parallel to DP,
                                                 is
 nor vertical, the bare cost of production of the article generally in
 creases as the quantity increases; and in that case                          D'P'   is   not verti
 cal.      Again, the       rate   of   interest required to tempt additional capital

into a particular field is not constant, but increases, hence P'D' is
steeper than       PD.    I  see at present no means of experimentally
 ascertaining the gain reaped by producers represented by the area
 PDD'P'     ; it  can be approximately estimated by considering the pre
 vailing rate of interest in the producing community and         the amount
 of capital required for the production of the unit of the        article.

      We   see that     the gain   of  a manufacturing    capitalist   may     be
 divided into two parts — the profit       as a trader, and the interest as a
 capitalist.
      In safe    trades, where   there are few fluctuations    in price, the
  former gain may perhaps be the most important; in more specu
 lative trades the latter.
      There is yet a third source of gain to the manufacturing com
 munity : the labourer who produces the            goods earns his wages by
 the manufacture, and this is an advantage to him.           In the diagram,
  the area     OP'D'D"      represents the wages     paid for labour       alone.
  The length of the lines between OY and P'D' represent the                wages
 of labour per unit of goods, increasing as the quantity of                 goods
  required increases.        This is lost to the community if the manu
  facture is stopped.       Thus the whole sum paid by the consumer is
 the area OMDU";          and tliis is made up of three parts, one of which

                         of Edinburgh,        Session 1871-72.                     623
is    the profit      to the trader, one the interest to the capitalist, and
one      the wages of the labourer;           all these advantages    are lost  if the
manufacture ceases.
      The gain of the labourer             does not resemble      the profit of the
 trader,      or the interest    of the capitalist.      The profit of the trader is
 the      difference between        his valuation of the goods and what he
  gets     for them.       If  he does      not sell his goods he still has his
  goods,     he only loses the profit.        Similarly, if the capitalist  does not
  sell    his capital, he still has his capital.            Now, the area    P'PDE'
  represents the profit made by the capitalist on the particular
  employment of his capital, and this is all that he loses if unable to
  sell that capital      ; but the area OP'D'D" represents           the whole sum
   received       by the labourers, not their          profit.   The profit of the
   labourer may perhaps          be considered as the excess       of wages which
   he earns in      a particular    trade,   over that which would just tempt
   him to work rather than           starve or go into the workhouse.
       If   the consumer purchases the article for simple unproductive
    consumption,       then the loss to him is only represented          by the area
    DMN.        If,  however,   a community        purchases goods, and consumes
    them productively, then, by the cessation of the trade, they in their
    turn lose the interest on the capital they employ, and the laboureis
    of the community        lose   their wages     ; so that, in that case, the loss
    to the buyer, who cannot be classed as an immediate consumer, is
    made up      of three   parts,   similar to those enumerated in the case of
    the seller.
                                      Taxes on Trade.
       Having distinguished between the three distinct advantages
    given by trade,      I will now consider the incidence of a tax on trade,
    levied as a fixed sum per unit of goods, as one pound per ton, or
    one   shilling per gross.
       The effect of such          a tax   is to produce a constant difference
    between     the price paid by the buyer and the price received by the
    seller.    The market prices         are determined in the diagram         of the
    supply and demand curves, by the points between which a line
    parallel to OX, and equal in length to the tax, can be filled between
    the two curves.
       Thus,     if  in figure 3,     FN    be the demand curve, and         PE     the
    supply curve, and       if the length      of  the line CC' be the amount        of

624                Proceedings       of the Royal Society
the   tax per unit of goods,         then OM is the market price to the
supplier,    OM' the market price to the buyer and the                difference
Mm' is equal to the tax.
    The total amount raised        by the tax from the transactions repre
sented in the diagram, is           measured   by the area MCC'M'.           The

portion paid by the seller is measured by the area CC"M"M.                    The
 portion paid by the buyer is measured          by the area    CC'M'M".       The
 whole loss entailed by the tax on the two communities is measured
 by the area MCDC'M'         ;  the loss to the sellers is measured by the
 area   CDM'M;       the   loss to the buyers       by the     area   MDC'M';
 both buyers and sellers suffer a loss beyond the tax they pay.               Thii
 excess   of loss is represented     by the area   CCD      for the sellers, and
 CCD     for the buyers.
    If  the tax be large, the line       CC will approach the axis OX, the
 tax will be   unproductive, and the area CCD representing the excess
 of injury to the buyers and sellers will be large, compared with the
 produce of the tax.        This fact   is one justification   of free trade.
    There is a certain         magnitude of tax which          will produce the
 maximum       revenue    or value for the area       MCC'M'.       The ratio in
 which the tax falls, iu one sense, on sellers and buyers is simply
 the ratio    of the diminution of price obtained by the sellers to            the
 increase of price paid      by the buyers.
    It is absolutely clear that this is the proportion in which the tax
 is actually   paid  by the two parties, although this may by no means

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                               625
correspond         to the relative suffering inflicted on the two parties, nor
is it       even the proportion in which the two parties lose by the loss
of     trade profit.         The whole    loss of either party           is,   as the diagram
shows, always greater than the tax they pay.                             The relative total
losses of the two communities                  as traders, are      in proportion to      the
areas        MCDM"          and M'C'DM"    ;      and these       areas    might approxi
mately,         at least,     be ascertained by experiments               for this purpose,
treating CD and CiD as straight lines, we only require to know the
quantity and price of the goods before the imposition of the tax,
and the quantity and price afterwards.
      Thus,     if   a   tax of 2d. per pound were imposed on the trade in
 cotton       between ourselves and America,          if    before the tax we imported
 500 million lbs.           at one   shilling, and after the tax           300    million lbs.
 for which        we paid 13 £d., and the Americans                    received ll^d., the
 total      loss to the two communities as traders would be 600 + 200 =
 800 million pennies, the produce of the tax 600 million pennies.
    England would pay of the tax 450 million pennies. England's
 total loss would be 600 million pennies. America would pay
 of the tax 150 million pennies. America's total loss would be
 200 million pennies. The incidence would be the same whichever
 government levied the tax.
       It   follows from the above principles, that               ifa     holder sells unre
 servedly, trusting to the competition between the buyers to produce
 the market, the whole tax falls on the seller;                           the supply curve
 becomes         a vertical straight      line.      If   a   buyer buys unreservedly,
 the whole tax falls on him           ;   in this case the demand curve becomes
 a    vertical straight line.
       Thus,    if   sales by auction     were subject to          a   tax ad valorem       or
  otherwise, and         if   sales were quite unreserved, the number                of trans
  actions not being altered, the prices would be unaltered, but the
  sellers would only get the prices minus the tax.
       This     case does not practically          arise,     because,    if    auctions were
  really so taxed, although            in each auction that occurred the sale
  might be unreserved, auctions would, as                   a   whole, be checked; fewer
  people would put up their goods for sale in that way, — the prices
  would rise, the number of transactions would be diminished, and
  the tax would really be borne                in part by the buyers and part by
     the sellers.

     If the trade between          two countries really consists in the exchange
of goods, effected by the agency of money as a unit for expressing
value, but not involving the actual transfer of coin, the above prin

gains which each party would make by each trade                                   if it   alone
existed.
     If   by duties one portion of the trade be extinguished or much
diminished, both parties lose, but                 if   the other portion of the trade
remain uninjured, then, although there may be no exchange of
commodities other than of goods for actual money, nevertheless
the full gain on that               which is untaxed remains                 intact.      Thus,
although the French                may tax our goods,            and so     inflict   a loss on
themselves and on us, this is no reason for our inflicting an addi
tional loss on the two communities by taxing the import of their
goods.
                                         House Rent.
     I   will next consider        the effect    of   a tax on house rent.
     Landlords     are here        the sellers, and tenants the buyers of what
may be termed a commodity                    ;   not the house,        but the loan of         a
house for a term of years — the tenant buys what might be called,
by the extension of a suggestion of Professor Jevons, a house-year
from his landlord.
     The difference       between the house and other commodities such as
food or dress      is,   that the house remains, whereas they are consumed.
The house-year           is   consumed year by year, but          it   is   reproduced year
by year without               material   fresh expenditure         on       the part of the
landlord.       This permanency alters the incidence of taxation.
     If the   demand falls off the landlord cannot remove                       his    house-
he cannot cease to produce his house-year, which therefore he
must dispose of. Hence, in  stationary or declining community,
                                          a
where no new houses are being built, but where year after year                                 a
sensible proportion remains unoccupied, the landlord must sell his
house-year unreservedly, and any tax imposed on house rent would
fall on .him alone; that  to say, he would receive a rent dimin
                                    is
ished by the full amount of the tax, and the tenant would pay no
more rent for a house of  given class than
                                    a        no tax were imposed.
                                                             if
The supply curve becomes  straight horizontal line, and
                                         a                 un                             is

                        of Edinburgh,      Session 1871-72.                     627
the     tax  ; the number of houses let is unaltered by the tax, but the
landlords lose as rent the whole amount raised by taxation.
      This reasoning is based on the assumption, that the supply curve
 has    become     a straight horizontal    line unaffected by     the tax.    This
 condition is altered in any prosperous or growing community.
 Xliere, new houses must be built, and a considerable number of
 houses      are always unlet, not because they are not required by the
 community, but          because   the speculative builders are holding          out
  for higher terms.           This   produces a supply       curve of the kind
  common       to all other kinds of goods.       At higher prices      more goods
  are forthcoming.          A newly imposed tax will then            be distributed
   between     sellers and buyers, landlords         and tenants in a manner
   depending on the form of these curves.               A sensible check will     be
   given to the letting of houses, tenants will be content with some
   what less good houses,          and landlords     with rather smaller rents.
   This is the immediate        effect of the tax — the greater portion would
   probably fall on the landlords          at first, at least   in the new   houses
    where fresh contracts are being made.              But after   a  few years the
   conditions would have altered.           New houses are only built because
    the   builders   obtain the usual trade profit and interest on their
    capital — the check to letting consequent          on the imposition      of the
    tax will therefore diminish the supply of new houses until, owing to
    diminution     in supply, rents    have risen to their old average.        Then
    builders resume their operations.          The whole tax by that time will
    be borne by the tenants;        that is to say,   if there were no tax they
    would get their houses cheaper by the precise amount of the tax,
    because    rents so diminished would suffice           to induce     speculative
    builders to supply them.         The rents through the whole town            are
    ruled by those of the new districts.            There is a certain relative
    value between       every house     in the town, and     if  the rents of new
    houses are dearer the rents       of the old    houses   are increased in due
    proportion.      In  fact, when new houses need to be supplied year by
    year,   houses    are commodities which        are being produced, and       the
    tax falls on the consumers.
       The    above    principles determine the incidence of a tax, whether
    nominally levied on the landlord or tenant, but in their application
    account must be taken of the mental inertia of both landlords and
     tenants, as well as of the fact that many contracts for houses are

 628                 Proceedings      of the Royal Society
not immediately         terminable.      These two conditions         will for the
first few years after the imposition of any new tax cause it to fall
on the party from whom          it is nominally     levied.
   Precisely    as a tax on trade not only falls            on the trader?,     but
injures capitalists and labourers, a tax on house rents injures the
capitalists who build houses and the labourers they employ —not
that the capitalist pays the tax, but he is prevented from finding                  a
useful investment for his money owing to the diminution                     in the
number or quality of houses required.
                                 Taxes on    Land.
    The question of the incidence of taxes on land is peculiarly in
teresting.     Land differs from all other commodities, inasmuch as
the quantity of it does not depend on the will of any producer.
The number of houses in a flourishing community does depend on
the   will of speculative builders;       but land can only be increased in
quantity by such processes         as enclosing commons, or breaking             up
private pleasure grounds.          We will neglect these small disturbing
influences, and assume        that all the land in a country is available for
cultivation, where such cultivation is profitable; and that the absence
of profit is the only    reason for neglecting to cultivate any portion        of it.
    It  is well known that the rent of each acre of land is simply the
excess     of annual value of that        acre over the annual value        of the
poorest land which tenants think it worth while to cultivate.                   We
may classify     all  land   according    to    the  total return    which  it  will
yield per acre upon capital invested in its cultivation            ;  and we may
draw a supply curve of land such that the ordinates will be the total
quantities of land which will return each successive              percentage on
the capital required to cultivate it.           The supply diminishes       as the
rate   of percentage increases,       that is to say, there is less land which
will return ten per cent. on the capital than will return five per
cent., and still less land which will return twenty or thirty per cent.
    Tf, therefore, tenants as a body, considered as capitalists, will not
cultivate any land which does not yield twenty per cent., there will
be far less land in the market than          if  they will be just satisfied with
ten per cent.
    Again, all tenants are not of one mind, and we may construct                    a
demand curve in which the ordinates are the total quantities                      of

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                        629
land which would          be let,   if  the land paying    no rent be fixed at
each      successive    percentage.       The actual quantity of land let will
be determined by the intersection of the two curves, and is                repre
 sented by the height MD, fig. 4.
     If we    now build a solid on the base OD'DN, such that its height
 all along      each ordinate    x is the number of hundreds of pounds of
 capital per      acre required to give the percentage corresponding            to
 the length       x, then we shall     have  a volume standing on (OD'DN),
 the contents of which will measure             the total annual returns from
 all the land cultivated.*             The rent    is the volume standing on
 MDN, the profit received by the farmers is the volume standing
 on     OD'DM,       and   this   is   in excess    of what would     have    just
  tempted them to cultivate              by the volume      MDP.       We may,
 therefore, considering         the farmer as a capitalist    and a trader, call
 the volume on          MDP his      trade  profit, and the volume on OD'D
  the interest on his capital,
    The     effect of any tax on the land is to reduce the interest       which
  each class     of land is  capable   of returning   on the capital employed.
  This it will do in very different ways according to the manner in
  which the tax is levied.
    * If  L.160 per acre are required to give the percentage x of any one class of
  goods,  the height of the ordinate perpendicular to the plane of OD'DN will
  be 1-5.

   If   the tax be an ad valorem                duty on rent, it will modify the
supply curve only between               D   and     N.   There will remain just     as
much land as before capable of paying rates of interest less than
OM, but the quantity of land capable                    of paying the higher rates
will   be diminished        ;   in other words,      the rate of interest which the
poorest     land worth cultivating pays will not                be affected, for this
land pays no rent and remains untaxed — hence                       no land   will  be
thrown out of cultivation, but the supply curve will be altered from
DN    to   DN', diminishing the volume representing rent, but leaving
the other quantities untouched;                  hence   any tax assessed on rent
is paid wholly       by the landlord.              The amount of the tax is        the
volume standing on               DNN'.        It  is curious to remark that this
tax in no way falls on               the    consumer.       The tax     on rent sim
ply diminishes       the        excess   of    value which some land has over
others   ;  no land is thrown           out of cultivation, and no less capital
employed       in   production         than      before;    no  one suffers but the
landlord.      If, instead of being             assessed on the rent, the tax is
assessed on the produce            of the cultivation, the incidence of the tax
will   be   greatly modified.          The cultivation of land will no longer
be so profitable     ;    i.e.,   the returns from capital employed on the
land will be less       ;   in other words, the whole supply curve of the
land will     be  modified, falling everywhere              if the produce taxed     be
that which is produced on all qualities                   of land.   Some land will
fall out of cultivation, and only part of the tax will be borne by
the landlord; part will fall in the first instance on the tenant, but
he,  like any other manufacturer, will recover almost the whole
of his portion from the consumer.                      Tenants will be injured by
the limitation of the number of transactions, and labourers by the
diminution      in the amount of work required.                  This is the effect   of
an octroi duty.
   Sometimes a tax is assessed not on the rent, but on an assumed
value per acre.        Such a tax can never be raised on land which pavs
no rent, for the owner would rather abandon possession of the land
than pay the tax.             It  might, however, lead to the abandonment of
the cultivation      of poorer        soils  ;  it would then injure tenants       and
consumers, although they would not pay one penny of the tax; for
taxes cannot be paid out of lands which lie waste ; assuming that
the   tax is always less than the rent, as it certainly always should

be, it will be paid wholly by the landlords.                             The tax in this       case
does not diminish the supply of land.
      A   cognate     question of great interest              is,   Who    reaps the benefit of
any       improvements in agriculture, making land return more than                                  it
previously did         ?     This improvement may require, and probably will
require, increased investment of capital.           The whole supply curve
will be     raised; assuming the demand to remain the same, fig. 5,M"D"
will      be the new increased number                   of   acres in cultivation,        but land
will      be left uncultivated           which would have returned the interest
 OM       on capital.         The volume standing                 on   D'D"N" will       be much
 greater than that on D'DN, for the third dimension will also have
 increased;          the average        rate    of interest and the         trade profit     of the
 tenant      will     have    increased, and           it    is   highly probable that          the
 volume         standing       on   D"M"N" may               be greater than that which
 stood on       DNM    ;     but this    is    by no means certain.           It   might at first
 be    actually       smaller.      In all probability,                however,    the     demand
 curve     is   very nearly vertical,           a   small increase of profit tempting                a

 largely increased investment of capital in farming.   If this be so,
 then the landlord also reaps considerable benefit from the improve
 ment, for   the farmers were contented with nearly the same rate
                if
 of interest as before, the solid standing on DRNN"D* which he
 gains would be larger than the solid on DRM"M which he loses                                    ;
 moreover,       the volume on RNM", which he retains,                             is   increased.
 Labourers and consumers also gain.

4.  Additional Notes on the Occurrence of the Sperm-Whale
            in the Scottish Seas.          By Professor Turner.
   In   a communication       made to this Society on the 6th February.
1871,    I noted the capture      of a sperm-whale at Oban in May, 1829,
and   I  collected from various sources        records of the stranding         of
seven additional specimens on the Scottish coasts.
   Since that communication           was published, a large       sperm-whale
has come ashore on the west coast          of the  Isle of Skye,    some    parti
culars concerning which         I propose to relate in this communication.
   Tourists    in Skye, during the past autumn, who               visited    Loch
Corruisk by boat from Torrin, as they sailed up Loch Scavaig, be
came conscious, by another sense than that            of sight, that a large
animal in a state of putrefaction was in their immediate vicinity.
   A correspondent of the "Glasgow Herald," writing in July last,
states that a great whale entered Loch Scavaig about the middle of
that month, and after floundering             about,   bellowing     like  a  bull
amongst the rocks, amidst which it had become               entangled, it died
after a lapse of two or three days.           Large    quantities     of blubber
were removed      from the carcase without loss of time by the neigh
bouring fishermen, but enough of the external form remained to
enable the correspondent to give the following description : Skin
black, thick and corrugated.           Head enormous,     square, ending in a
flat snout some eight or ten feet across, looking like a peat stack.
Eye small, surrounded with lashes, some 16 feet from the snout.
Blower covered with        a flap a foot long.    Under jaw slender, shorter
than the upper, in it were thirty-six teeth          shaped   like the ends     of
ducks' eggs.      No   teeth were visible in the upper jaw.           The whale
could not be short of 60 feet in length.
   My attention having         been directed by    Sir Robert Cbristison        to
the newspaper      report,   I at once   recognised from the form of the
head, jaw, and teeth, that the characters were those             of the sperm-
whale (Physeter maaocephalvs), and             I determined,     if possible, to
obtain a portion,     if  not the whole of its skeleton.         The distance,
however,     of the spot,     where the carcase     was  lying, from human
habitations, and     the want of proper appliances for lifting              heavy
objects, have proved hindrances to the removal of the huge cranium
of  the animal,    but the two halves of the lower jaw, and             a number

                       of Edinburgh,       Session 1871-72.                  633
of     the smaller bones        of the skeleton,      are  now in my posses
sion.
     From     the examination      of these bones an estimate may be formed
of    the  age, size, and,   I  believe, also the sex of the animal.
     The    state of ossification of the bones proved that the animal had
reached its full period of growth, for the epiphysial plates were
 anchylosed to      the bodies of the vertebrae, the lower     jaw had attained
 a great length, the radius         and ulna were anchylosed together, both
 at their upper     and lower ends, and the various subdivisions          of  the
 sternum      were welded into one massive bone.
      As some estimate may be formed of the size of the animal from
 the dimensions of its lower jaw, it may be useful to give the
  measurements of this bone, and at the same time to compare it
  with the dimensions of some other specimens.
      In  the Natural History department of the Edinburgh Museum
  of Science and Art is          a  magnificent    lower jaw,   which was pre
  sented many years ago by Captain William Hardie.                  It possesses
  twenty-five     teeth   on one side, but     only twenty-four    on the other.
  On the outer face of the right mandible there has been engraved               a
  large picture of the boats          of the ship "Woodlark " of London,
  Captain     William Hardie, engaged in the capture of the sperm-
  whale, in a school of sperm-whales, off the Banda Islands, April
  7th, 1843.      On the other half, a figure, 43 inches long, of a sperm-
  whale has been engraved.             As authentic drawings of this animal
  are by no means common, and as this figure has been executed with
  a  considerable amount of artistic skill, and in all probability by one
  well acquainted with the form and proportions of this animal,                 I
  produce on the following         page a reduced copy.      In the Anatomical
   Museum of the University of Edinburgh is the mandible of a young
   male,   presented    two years ago by my pupil,          Mr F. B. Archer of
   Barbadoes.      The animal was captured in the North Atlantic Ocean,
   in the latitude of the Azores.
      Professor Flower has also carefully recorded * the dimensions of
   three  specimens from Tasmania,           in the Museum of the London

     The specimens in      the  Edinburgh Museums corroborate the con
 clusions arrived at      by Mr Flower, that a gradual increase in the
 length of the symphysis, compared with that of the entire jaw,
 takes place as age advances,         and it is obvious also that the girth
 behind diminishes        in proportion to the increase in the length of
  the jaw.     This increase is without doubt co-ordinated with the
  development and growth of the teeth.
     Although the     teeth had been removed by the fishermen, and sold
  to tourists before the mandible      of the Skye sperm-whale came into
  my possession, yet the sockets were entire, and twenty-four on each
 side could be counted, so that the animal had attained its complete
 dentition.    Seven loose teeth were, however, sent, all of which, with
 one exception, were worn on the surface and sides           of  the crown.     In
 all, the pulp cavity was completely closed           at the extremity of the
  fang, and, in several, irregular outgrowths from the surface of the
  fang were present.       Two of the    teeth, though worn at the crown,
  closely corresponded in general form with the one not so affected,
  and   were  much more slender and           tapering than the remaining
  four, the roots of which were much more bulky.            The unworn tooth
  was five inches      long, and the greatest circumference of its root
  4J inches.

grooves passed for some inches backwards along the             inferior   surface
of the bone.      On the inferior surface there was no indication of            the
original transverse segmentation       ; on the superior surface, 19 inches
in front of the posterior end, a deep transverse fissure passed             across
the bone    through the middle of the third pair of costal articular
facets, but there was no trace of the original          division between       the
first and second segments.

hone   in the specimens which            he  has examined.       In  one  from
Tasmania the length          was    14J inches, whilst in the Caithness
Cachalot the hinder piece is represented by a median spheroidal
nodule of bone, 4 inches in diameter, imbedded in dried cartilage.
The terminal      piece   of  the    sternum is therefore variable in its
dimensions, and the greater length in the Skye specimen is without
doubt due to the age of the animal having rendered possible com
plete ossification of the terminal cartilage.

adult period of life is evident from the completed ossification and
the dimensions of its bones.           There can be,      I  think, little doubt
but that it was of the male sex. For although little has been
done in the descriptions of the sperm-whale to discriminate the
sexual characters of the skeleton, yet those who have had opportuni
ties of observing the habits of this cetacean,           agree    in ascribing     to
the male     a  much greater        magnitude     than is acquired         by    the
female.     That excellent naturalist, Mr F. D. Bennett, for example,*
states  that the adult female does not exceed the length of thirty,
or at most thirty-five feet.
    We may now          pass    from    the most recent specimen            to the
consideration of,     I   believe,   the most ancient relic of the sperm-
whale which has yet been found in the British Islands.
    In August     1871,   Mr George Petrie of Kirkwall presented to
the Royal Scottish Society of Antiquaries           a tooth recently obtained
from a   " brough" near      the Howe    of Hoxa, in the Isle of Sh. Ronald-
say, on a   promontory opposite the Bay of Scapa.                This tooth had
obviously been buried in the earth for a lengthened period, and in
all   probability    was    co-eval    with  the early      occupation      of the
"brough," and may have belonged               to one     of its early Norse, or
even still more ancient inhabitants.           This tooth     has been carefully
examined       by Professor      Duns,    Pr John Alexander Smith, and
myself, and we all agree in regarding it as the tooth of a sperm-
whale.     A part of    the alveolar end of the tooth, more especially on
one side,   has been      broken away, so that the conical-shaped pulp-
cavity is fully exposed.         The free   end  of the crown is smooth and
rounded, such as one sees         in specimens of well-worn teeth of this
 animal.    The length of the tooth is 5f inches, but, owing to a
part being broken off, this does not give its full length ; the greatest
 girth is 6f inches.
    Mr Petrie    has most courteously sent me an account            of the locality
 in which he discovered the tooth.           He   says  :—
                                                            "  I was glad to find
 that the tooth was of some interest.           I  was led to its discovery by
 a request    of my friend, Mr James Fergusson, the author of the
 '

 vicinity of the Howe of Hoxa, with the view of discovering, if

            now known as the Howe         The Howe is ap
parently a long-shaped natural mound of considerable height,
on which artificial mounds were probably made, as traces of
them can still be seen, as well as of a massive stone wall
encircling         a       great portion      of the top of the mound.                       On the
north end of the mound are the ruins of a large circular struc
ture, which, on being excavated between twenty and thirty years
ago, was found to be the remains                       of   a brough or round tower.                  On
proceeding to the spot last summer, and carefully examining the
mound,        I    found that it would involve                      much time, labour, and
expense to make               a   satisfactory examination.                I    determined, there
fore, to excavate a smaller mound, evidently wholly artificial, at a
short distance from the Howe of Hoxa, but connected at one time
with    it,   as traces       of   an avenue       of stones leading from the                   one to
the other were still to be seen.                   I       expected to find           a   chambered
tomb, but to my surprise                    a     structure        resembling         the ordinary
brough, but far less symmetrical than such buildings usually are,
was revealed.          I      am    inclined      to   think that          it   was sepulchral        in
character, although of              a   type unique, so far as my experience goes.
The passages or galleries were still roofed in many parts                                    by   flag
stones laid across from wall to wall.The excavations did not pro
duce many relics, but amongst these were bits of dark pottery and
several vertebrae of whale much scorched by fire. One of the ver
tebrae, about          1   foot in diameter at the broadest part, and                      9J   inches
in height, had been fashioned into                     a   rude vessel by scooping out the
central or more porous part of the bone, as                           is    often the case.           It
was found about two feet beneath the surface                  of the mound at                         A,
on what appeared              to be   the floor of the interior of the structure,
and    it   and the other vertebrae were buried beneath the ruins, which
seemed to have fallen upon them.                            The tooth      was found at         B,   and
not far off       a    piece of freestone, convex on one side and slightly
concave on the other.                    The concave              side was      tolerably smooth,
apparently due to friction of                 a    freestone rubber passing frequently
over    its surface.              Similar   stones         were    found in the brough                of
Hoxa,       when       it    was    cleared       out some         years       ago.   They      much
resemble       the     slightly hollowed stones                   found at New Grange,                in

   As bearing on the early history of the sperm-whale in the Bri
tish islands, I may next refer to a passage in a memoir by the
eminent Norwegian archaeologist,      Professor P. A. Munch, to
which my attention has been directed by Mr Joseph Anderson,
the curator of the Antiquarian Museum.        The memoir is en
titled " Geographical Elucidations of the Scottish and Irish Local
Names occurring in the Sagas,"* and on pp. 128, 129, Professor
Munch, in his account of             the Shetland        Isles, says: —
                                                                           " The island
of Yell      is nearly divided into two          halves by the deep fiords which
penetrate on each side, Whalefirth (Hvalfjorftr) on the west, and
Reafirth      (ReySarljorSr)       on the east.         In   a deed    dated   May   19,
1307, which speaks of the pledging                   of the estate Kollavagr, now
Cullavoe, one of the witnesses is a Hogni i ReySarfirol.                           This
ReySarfjorSr       is clearly      the above        Reafirth,     early contracted, or
rather corrupted, even by Norse speakers,                    to   Rafjord."    Further,
Professor Munch states, it is very suitable that the two opposite
fiords should be called, the one Hvalfjoror and                        the other Rey-
CarfjortSr,' for ReySr (now called RoSr or Ror, in Norway), is also a
kind of whale, the Physeter             macrocephalus,          black-headed sperma
ceti whale.
     If we   are to accept this interpretation           by Professor Munch, that
the old Norse term Reyoar was equivalent to our sperm-whale, then
we should have to assume that this cetacean                     was so well known to
the ancient Norsemen that they had                  coined a word to designate it.
And it is indeed not improbable that, considering their roving
habits, they may have sailed in the seas which it most usually
frequents, and perhaps have chased it for the sake of its valuable
oil.
   But from the association of this name with a particular firth in
the Shetland group of islands, it would, granting the accuracy of
Munch's interpretation, seem            as   if,   in the early years of the Norse
settlement, the sperm-whale had not unfrequently entered this firth,
and     perhaps been       captured there —         a   circumstance which would
show that      this animal        was then   a     much more frequent visitor of

indeed to have been for some centuries past.
   But   I    think it very questionable if the interpretation given by
Professor Munch of the old word ReySar can be regarded as
zoologically correct. Torfaeus, the historian of Greenland, in bis
account of the cetacea which frequent the Greenland                      and Iceland
seas,* uses the term Reidr three times in his description                      of these
whales.        One he terms Hrafnreidr, white in colour, of a                length of
fourteen or sixteen cubits,           "  branchiis etiam praeditus," and taste*
well.    A second, called Hafreidr, a whale of sixty cubits, or a little
more, which carries a small horn, and is most pleasant to eat.                     The
third is named Reidr, or most usually Steipireidr, which, be says,
surpasses all others in sweetness, is gentle, and not to be feared by
ships.    The largest which has been caught by the Northmen equals
130  cubits, is very fat,
                                  " branchiis gaudet," but wants teeth. This
description by Torfaeus is much wanting in precision, and the state
ment that the Hrafnreidr and Reidr possess branchiae would lead
one to say,        if  this term were understood by him in the sense in
which it is now employed, that these animals were not whales, but
fishes.       It  is probable, however, that the so-called branchiae                iu
Hrafnreidr and Steipireidr              may be the plates of whalebone which
depend     from the roof of the mouth of the baleen whales, and whicb
have    a laminar        arrangement not unlike the gills of a fish, and
might readily be mistaken for such by an inexperienced observer.
The   absence       of teeth,   however,    conclusively shows that these could
not be sperm whales.
    Otho Fabricius,          in his " Fauna Groenlandica,"f identifies the
Hrafnreidr of Torfaeus with the fin-whale named by Linnxus
Balcena       loops; and the Reidr or Steipereidur with the Bal&na
musculus       of the     same    naturalist.     By Otho F. Hiiller,} the term
Reider or Reydur is applied to two species of Baleen whales.
Mohr also, in his Natural History of Iceland, § adopts the classifica
tion of Fabricius;          and  Erik Jonsson, in his Dictionary of old Noree
terms, ||   accepts the definition         of  the above    naturalists.      Further,

both the lexicographer and the naturalists agree in giving as the
Norse equivalent for our term sperm-whale, not ReySar, but
Burhvalr.       Munch himself, also, by putting the Norwegian term
Rohr or Ror as equivalent to the older word ReySar, supplies me
with   an additional argument against the latter word being regarded
as signifying sperm-whale, for Ror or Rorhval is merely our term
 Rorqual,   i.e., a whale with folds and sulci extending        longitudinally
 along the belly, such as one sees         in the Bahenopteridae or Finner
 whales, but which do not exist in the sperm-whale.
    Hence we cannot regard Reafirth in           Yell  as having received its
 name from       having    once   been  a place   of resort for the sperm-
 whale, or as affording any evidence that our seas were                   at one
 time more largely       frequented by these       huge cetaceans        than at
 the present day.
    But though this name loses its interest in connection with the
 natural   history of the sperm-whale, it acquires importance in
 reference to the natural history of the rorquals.              Of this group
 of whales, two, viz., the common Finner, and the species of Fin
 whale, of which we had recently so fine a specimen stranded at
 Longniddry, attain a length of upwards of 60 feet, and are not
 uncommon in our seas. By modern zoologists, the common Fin
 ner is usually called Balcenoptera        musculus   (Physalvs antiquoruni),
 and may be identical          with   the Hrafnreidr      of  Torfaeus.      The
 other, the Balcenoptera      Sibbaldi, has been identified by Professor
 Reinhardt and myself       * as identical with the Rorqual, to which the
 Icelanders     even  at the present day apply the name of Steypir-
 eythr.     In all   probability   the firth on the east side of Yell, now
 known as Reafirth,       was   frequented     by these   Rorquals,     and was
 named     by the ancient        Norse settlers, ReySarfjorSr,        from   this
 circumstance,      whilst the  deep inlet of the sea on the west side         of
 the island,      now known      as  Whale-firth, may have obtained its
  Norse   name of Hvalfjordr         from having been the resort of the
  "caaing" whale, which in large herds still frequents the Orkney
  and Shetland seas, and is killed in great numbers by the islanders.

         1. Note on Cystine.             By James Dewar, F.R.S.E.
    The following observations on Cystine are a continuation of those
formerly communicated to the Society by Dr Arthur Gamgee and
myself, during the course of the Session 1869-70, and reprinted
with addition in the          "Journal of Anatomy and Physiology"               for
that year;     and   although       really little of a novel nature to present
to the Society,    still it is  necessary   to show some additional fucts have
   •
      In connection with this animal, I may refer to an essay in the " Scottish
Naturalist," dated November 1871, by Mr Robert Walker, of St Andrews, in
which he describes and figures the vertebra of a whale, in the University
Library of that city, which he believes to be the tenth dorsal of a youngish
Cachalot.    He believes it to be a relic of a whale stranded there, from which
Mr Foster, a former Regent in the University of St Andrews, obtained a para
site which he sent to Sibbald, who figured it.          He thinks that the whale
figured on the same plate, though stated to be stranded at Monifieth, may have
bwu this animal.

                         of Edinburgh,    Session 1871-72.                 645
been      observed      tending    towards the synthesis of this interesting
substance.
     The   most important fact ascertained with regard to the chemical
relation of cystine in memoir referred to was the production of
pyruvic acid, when it was treated with nitrous acid. In this re
action the amido residue           was not alone eliminated, the sulphur also
separating as sulphuric acid, however carefully the experiment was
 performed.         The fear of allowing the action to proceed too far, on
 the necessarily small quantity of substance operated upon, pre
 vented us from purifying the product thoroughly, and, consequently,
 the analysis differed slightly from that of pure pyruvic acid.             We
 had no hesitation in saying, however,             the acid agreed  better with
 the chemical characters of the syrupy modification of pyruvic acid
 than with that of Wischelhaus's             carbacet oxylic acid, that we had
 anticipated would be produced, and that in all probability cystine
 would be found to be an amido-sulpho pyruvic.
     If cystine     is directly related to pyruvic acid, it must contain five
 instead of seven hydrogen atoms (and this supposition agrees well
  with the published analysis).           The formula of the compound will
 then be, CaH5NO2S.              On this supposition, we may derive from
 pyruvic acid at least five isomers, that will all have the general
 characters of cystine, although there are many other possible con
  stitutional    formulae.

     Of the five possible cystines formulated, it is impossible to select
  that of the natural substance, because of our ignorance of the inter
  mediate sulpho-acid.           All  attempts to replace the amido group
  alone by the action       of nitrous acid having failed, I have tried several
  experiments, with the object of replacing the sulphur alone, with
  the small quantity of cystine at my disposal.
      If cystine     is one of the above five substances, the replacement

  646                Proceedings          of the Royal Society
  of  the sulphur     by hydrogen          will generate very different bodies.
  Theory enables us to predict that, in the case of bodies having the
  constitutional formulae of No. (5), we ought to obtain alanine.
  In that of (3)     (,8) alanine, and in           that of (4) amido-lactic acid
 (serine), and in that of (2) amido-glycerine ; whereas it is diffi
 cult to imagine the sulphur in (1) being replaced.                         A success
 ful experiment in this direction ought                to restrict    the selection    to
  two possible constitutional formulas in               the   worst case, and syn
  thetical   processes      might      then be attempted.           It  was    formerly
 observed     that nascent hydrogen              generated    in an acid solution,
 readily liberated sulphuretted             hydrogen, aud might be used as a
 test for this substance.          The action goes on, however, very slowly,
 and it was found extremely difficult to get anything like the theo
 retical quantity of sulphur evolved.               With this experience,        sodium
 amalgam suggested            itself    as being     more   powerful,    and equally
 likely   to  act.    When cystine is dissolved in caustic soda,                     and
 sodium amalgam added, in a few minutes it is easy to detect                         the
 presence    of a sulphide by the nitro-prusside             test.    The action     was
 allowed to proceed         for several days,        being occasionally       rendered
 acid by the addition of hydrochloric acid; and the amalgam renewed.
 Ultimately the alkaline             solution,     after being      neutralised     with
 hydrochloric acid, was evaporated              and treated with      boiling alcohol
 to separate     the   chloride of solium, and to dissolve any hydro-
 chlorate of alanine that might              be  formed.     After the filtrate      was
 evaporated,    the residue       still contained sulphur, from the presence
of hydrochlorate of cystine.               This was separated by treating with
 water, and the filtrate was boiled with oxide of lead, treated after
wards with sulphuretted hydrogen to precipitate the dissolved lead,
and evaporated.         The residue       was then heated to 200 C.          in  a tube,
 with the object of subliming             the alanine.       No crystalline       subli
mate    was observed      ;  it is probable, therefore, that substances of
the constitutional       formulas of        5 do   not express the constitution
of normal cystine.             This result is subject to a certain amount
of reservation, from the difficulty of separating a small quantity
of substance from a very large amount of secondary material
accumulated in the course             of the experiment.           The battery is far
better adapted to give          a supply of nascent hydrogen in this case;
and an experiment made             in this way looks promising,           if sufficient
material was to be had.

   The small quantity of substance left I have employed for the
purpose of corroborating the production of pyruvic acid, when it is
treated with hydrate of baryta.
   Took a decigramme of cystine, treated it in a tube with a solu
tion of hydrate of baryta, and heated it all night to a temperature
of   130°   C,   opened        it,   and   transferred contents to a beaker, boiled
to expel the ammonia produced, then added an exactly equivalent
quantity of sulphuric acid, filtered from the sulphate of baryta                                    ;
after boiling to expel the sulphuretted hydrogen, the filtrate evapo
rated contained yellow syrupy
                        a                        acid, which contained             a   few crystals
under the microscope, having                      the     appearance         of Finck's uvitic
acid.     Ammonia was added, and gave                         a   yellow solution, which was
evaporated on the water-bath;                    it   was dissolved in water,            and gave
 a white precipitate, with nitrate of silver, which was not distinctly
 crystalline   ;   it   also     gave      a   white     precipitate        with      subnitrate of
 mercury, and      a    red colour with           a    crystal of sulphate of iron, and
 no precipitate with sulphate of copper.                     The barium salt was also
 found to be non-crystalline,                  the acid lost the power of giving  red        a
 colour     with Ferric salts after treatment                        with sodium amalgam,
 and the composition of the silver salt agreed better with pyruvic
 acid then formerly.
     Considerable       progress has been made in an examination of the
 chemical   characters and relations of the thio-pyruvic      acids.
 Normal thio-pyruvic acid has been obtained from the di-chlorpro-
 pionic ether. When this ether     treated with excess of alcoholic
                                                  is
 sulphide of potassium, we obtain at once    precipitate of chloride a
 of potassium, and           a   solution of the potash salt of the new acid.
 When this       is   diluted        with water,        acidulated with sulphuric                acid,
 and shaken up with ether, the acid                      is   obtained in yellow crystalline
 plates, part of        it   seems to remain             a     viscid fluid.       The    lead    and
 silver salts are white and insoluble, blacken when heated.                                 It   pre
 cipitates mercurous salts black from the first.                          The calcium, barium,
 iron, cadmium, and copper salts are all soluble.                               The potassium
 and sodium salts are                intensely yellow, and decompose slightly on
 exposure to the air.             When         treated        with   tin and       sulphuric acid,
 they evolve sulphuretted hydrogen.
   The thio-carboxyl pyruvic acid has not yet been obtained in                                      a
 pure state.  When pyruvic acid    tr eated with pentasulphide of
 phosphorus,       a    violent       action takes place,                associated    with much

frothing; and when the product is distilled,       a large mass   of  carbon
is left in the retort, and a very small quantity            of distillate  is
obtained.      It is probable that chloro-pyruvil,     when treated     with
sulphide of potassium, will give a more satisfactory yield.             It is
the author's intention to make a careful comparison of these two
acids, and to transform      them into amido-acids, with the object of
making an artificial cystine;      and the results arrived at will shortly
 be communicated to the Society.
    The author's stock of cystine being now exhausted, he will feel
extremely indebted to any one who would spare him a small quan
tity for experimental purposes.

    movements of the Foetus under the influence of the Resultant
    of the Forces of Parturition.         By Dr   J. Matthews Duncan.
    The    observer  of the current literature of Midwifery finds nothing
 more   characteristic of it than the number of papers on the mechan
 ism of natural parturition.        These papers indicate for the most
 part an enlightened       zeal, for they are engaged     with a most im
 portant branch of this mechanism, namely, the mode of action of
 the force of labour upon the foetus and upon the passages, and the
 explanation     thereby obtained of the changes which take place in
 these as natural labour advances.
    For   these inquiries great additional value would accrue, were the
 amount of power exerted by the combined forces of parturition

well    known    ;  but they can be carried on to        a great degree of ad
vancement,      even while the amount of power exerted by the machine
is   unknown, or at least unsettled.
     Some of these inquiries as to the action of the force of labour
upon     the foetus and passage are very easily solved,        and   have     been
 long in this condition. But the most, and by far the most, import
 ant are questions only recently raised ; and of which it may be
 said that few are familiar to the profession even as questions, and
 still fewer    can be regarded as settled.         These inquiries form the
  natural   sequel to the most recent developments of our knowledge
  of natural parturition.        These have been chiefly engaged            in de
  scribing   how the foetus and the passages          actually behave      during
  the process, while the new inquiries          are destined to explain why
  they so behave.        These new inquiries will introduce us far more
  deeply into the subject of the mechanism of labour than those
  which    have    preceded   them.    They   are specially   difficult   because
  of the varying conditions of the force of labour and of the corre
  lated parts, the foetus and the passage. The former has the relations
  of its parts extensively changed while the           process of labour pro
  ceeds, and the latter is only produced at the time by what is called
  the development of parts, as the foetus advances.
     The subject to which I wish        at present to direct attention is the
  curves of the genital passage,        and   their influence on the pheno
  mena of parturition.
     I. The first curve to which      I  direct attention is said to be at the
  brim of the pelvis, and to have         its convexity directed downwards
  and forwards.       I  do not admit that the curve exists, but           it is of
  the utmost importance to decide the point, because, without doing
  so, we cannot possibly determine the primary direction            of  the driv
  ing force of labour.        Hitherto   and   now,  the axis of the gravid
  uterus has been and is generally regarded as coincident with the
  axis of the brim of the pelvis, and to indicate the direction of the
  resultant of the forces of parturition.       But  an elaborate   attempt has
  been recently made by Schatz and Schultze, especially by the former
  of these authors, to demonstrate that the axis of the uterus at rest
  and in action is inclined      to the axis of the brim of the pelvis, at a
  small    angle    opening    forwards   and   upwards, and of about ten
  degrees.    I    have  just  said that the axis of the uterus has been
  generally considered to indicate the primary direction of the driv

650                    Proceedings      of tlie Royal Society
ing power ; but it is evident that this can only be the case if a
variety of conditions be satisfied. Of these the following are pro
bably principal        : — the assistant driving force, which is auxiliary to
the proper uterine force, must be also directed in the axis of the
brim of the pelvis, being supposed to be uniformly applied to the
uterus by the circumjacent viscera and parts, acting like                     a fluid,
exerting pressure equally in all directions            : the uterus must be dis
tended with      a   fluid which is copious enough to prevent any part of
the walls being specially            pressed   upon or indented by the foetus        ;
or,  it must   have its tendency to become spheroidal              superiorly unre
strained. Now Schatz, in addition to giving the proper uterine
driving force a posterior inclination to the axis of the brim by
ascribing to the uterine axis such an inclination,                 still further in
creases   the inclination        of the whole driving       force,   by describing
the special direction of the auxiliary bearing-down driving force as
still  more    inclined      tlmn the direction of the uterine axis.            The
resultant of the combined or whole driving forces will of course,
according to Schatz, have a direction somewhere                   intermediate be
tween that      of  the uterine and that of the       auxiliary driving forces.
    Smellie's authority is        much relied upon in support of the exist
ence of this curve.          In his plates   he gives the uterus this    inclination
to the axis of the brim        of the pelvis,  both in natural cases and in cases
of deformity      ;   but this is not satisfactory evidence as to what he
believed,   for it is probable that in preparing his plates he did not
pay particular attention to the point.                Those of them to which
reference    is here made          (as  xii.  and  xiv.)  are not in the proper
sense drawings or pictures, but mere                plans, and might very well
have been       arranged as they are, merely because             in other respects
the works looked well.             Dr Barnes, in his recent work        on obstetric
operations, while adhering to the generally entertained view as to
the coincidence of the axis of the uterus and of the brim of the
pelvis, implies, by his descriptions and drawings, a belief that, in
most if not all cases of antero-posterior contraction of the brim of
the pelvis, the uterine axis is inclined to the axis of the contracted
brim, as Schatz believes it to be in cases generally.               This is not the
place for any    full criticism of what Barnes very aptly calls the curve of
the false promontory, because            I confine myself to ordinary or natural
conditions.      I    shall merely say that this important and practically
valuable doctrine of Barnes regarding the curve of the false promon

                              of Edinburgh,        Session 1871-72.                                 651
tory is made too general. It can be true                            and applicable only where
the posterior uterine obliquity is present,                         and   it   is nut demonstrated,
nor     is it probable that this always is so, in cases of deformity.
       It   is extremely desirable that means should be devised for ascer
taining the direction of the resultant of the combined                   forces of
parturition,            and      especially of the axis of the uterus in   action.
The         means       adopted     by Schatz with this object in view are not
satisfactorythey merely go the length of showing how carefully
                    ;
he entered upon the question. But it may be permitted me to
state reasons which tend to establish the ordinary opinion, and to
discountenance that of Schatz.
       If   the uterine axis is inclined            to the brim of the pelvis poste
riorly       to its axis, we should expect to find the child's head at the
commencement of labour, while yet above the brim, to                                     be   in a posi
tion which          has never,         so far as     I    know, been ascribed to it in
natural cases.                Smellie, in his plate xii., gives                   this position     con
sistently, but not truly.                  He could not avoid doing                     so, unless he
represented the child at rest as having                         a   left lateral flexion of the
head, which would be ridiculous.                         His   mode       of drawing the uterus
with this posterior obliquity created an exigency for him, which he
could get over only by what must be regarded                                    as misplacement        of
the head.           One         error thus led him into another.                       The    erroneous
posterior uterine obliquity forced him to represent the left side as
presenting in the very commencement of labour in an ordinary
case        of first cranial position with the occiput looking                            to the left.
I   do not see how the difficulty,                  Smellie         's   yielding to which gave
rise to error, can be avoided, except by assuming that the ordinary
view as to the axis of the pregnant uterus is correct.
    At the      same point where Smellie stumbled, Naegele also                                 fell into
error, but in an opposite direction.                           In   his classical essay on the
mechanism of birth, describing the first position of the foetal head,
he represents            it   as presenting                 of the pelvis, which it
                                                  at the brim
has not yet             fully   entered,   more obliquely than when it has entered
 it,   or as having           at the earliest stage its perpendicular                         axis more
inclined anteriorly                     of the brim; and in this way he
                                   to the axis
accounts        for his allegation that the right ear can generally be felt
at this time without                 difficulty    behind the pubic bone.*                      Here   a

652                        Proceedings        of the Royal Society
remark may be made similar to that applied to Smellie's drawing                                      ;
namely, that the head could not                    be bo placed    unless the uterus had
an anterior obliquity,                an    obliquity    opposite in direction to        that
figured by Smellie and described by Schatz                         ;    an    obliquity quite
incompatible             with Naegele's          own    description in his work on the
female pelvis ;* or unless the child maintained                          an unnatural         and
undescribed left lateral flexion of its bead.
   The now generally entertained views, that the axis of the uterus
coincides with the axis of the brim of the pelvis, and that the
foetal head presents at the brim directly,! have at least the merit
of evading such obvious and adverse criticism as the figure of
Smellie, and the expressed opinions of Schultze, Schatz, and of
Naegele, are liable to be subjected to.
     The great authority of                 Naegele was long sufficient to give               cur
rency to his statement that the head of the foetus, as it passed
through the brim of the pelvis, had its vertical axis in a position
of anterior obliquity to the plane of the brim, an obliquity which
is appropriately designated the Naegele                      obliquity, in order to dis
tinguish it from other obliquities at the same situation.                               The great
argument against this view, and the only one having a final charac
ter,   is,   that   it   is   not an accurate description of what takes place                    ;
but in addition,              it   has been argued against        it   that   it   is   impossible
to find      a   mechanism to account for it.               Stoltz's attempt to explain
its occurrence by mere lateral flexibility of the neck of the child
is   insufficient,         because     it   affords no explanation            why the lateral
flexion      is    towards the posterior shoulder             ;    but the now alleged
posterior obliquity of the uterus, as regards the axis of the brim,
affords      a   solution which Naegele did not foresee when he described
this obliquity as present and increasing with the increasing height
of the       head     in   or above the true pelvis.           If, adopting the kind of
nomenclature             introduced         by   Barnes, we describe          a    curve of the
natural       promontory, produced at the brim of the pelvis by the
posterior obliquity             of the uterus, then this curve, representing                     a
deflection of the             axis to the extent of about ten degrees, can                      be
easily made to account for the alleged Naegele                         obliquity during        the
first half of the passage of the child's head through the ligament

ous pelvis.         For, if  we suppose with         Schatz that the whole power
of     labour acts in an oblique line nearly corresponding to that of
the axis of       the uterus, or inclined      still  more posteriorly, then there
will     always be a tendency of the anterior half of the head, or of
that which is nearer         the concavity      of the curvature of       the passage,
to descend first, and         so produce the Naegele obliquity,            if  there be
uniform resistance to the advance of all parts of the head. But, as
the occurrence of Naegele's obliquity is now very generally denied,
any mechanism which accounts for it derives little or no support
of its own accuracy from the circumstance of its doing so.
     Still another difficulty in the way of admitting the                  presence      of
the curve of the natural promontory as the natural or ordinary con
 dition is worthy of consideration.              It is justly held that in natural
 labour the advance of the head through the brim of the pelvis is
 impeded only by friction and imperfect dilatation or dilatability of
 the soft parts      ; but,  if this curve of the natural promontory exists,
 a new and considerable difficulty            is introduced, namely, the differ
 ence between driving a body through a curved and a straight
 passage — a new difficulty which it appears to me unreasonable to
 admit.       And this is not all      ;   for this addition of difficulty is not
  overcome and passed when the child's head has traversed the curve,
  but lasts during most of the process of the birth of the child.                        If
  this curve exists, the axis of the genital              passage, regarded in the
  antero- posterior vertical plane, has the shape of a Roman S                  ; its first
  or upper curve, the curve of the natural promontory,                      having its
  concavity looking backwards; its second and universally recognised
  curve having its concavity looking               forwards.       I  believe we are
  nearer the truth when adopting the view at present generally en
  tertained, that, in the antero-posterior vertical plane, the genital
  passage     has ordinarily     only one curve, having the concavity of its
  axis looking forwards.
      Direct    therapeutical    bearings of this matter are             evident      and
  important both in natural and morbid parturition.                     Certain atti
  tudes    of the body, by increasing         or  diminishing the flexion of the
  iliac  beams upon the sacrum, a movement which                    I have elsewhere
  described as nutation of the sacrum,* may alter not only the dimen
  sions of certain parts,        but also     the relations      of the axis of the

pelvic brim to the axis of the uterus, or to the„direction of the
resultant of the'forces of labour. In an elaborate paper Schultze*
has attempted to show that similar                               results may     be    produced by
flexion and extension of the spine. .This author assumes that
the lower lumbar vertebrae govern the uterine axis, and that the
latter is normally inclined                     posteriorly to the plane of the pelvic
brim.        He therefore recommends that when difficulty                                   arises    at
the brim, the spine should be flexed so as to bring the axes of the
uterus and of the brim,                    if   possible,        into coincidence;         and   if   we
admit his assumptions, there can be no doubt as to the justice of
his conclusion.   For practical application, however, the proper
treatment may be stated in such a way as to offend no theory as
to axes of brim or of uterus, or so as to stand good whatever view
is held on these              points.       When,       before labour, or while the foetal
head is       still mobile       above      the brim, it is placed with its sagittal
suture not traversing the centre of the brim, but lying anterior                                      to
it   (as Smellie figures), then                 it will during early labour                be pressed,
with       a loss    of force, against the            pubes, not directly into the               brim.
It   will then        be worth while to              try whether flexion of the spine, by
putting the woman into the attitude assumed                                  in stooping forward,
will correct the direction of the head [which I consider an unna
tural direction].   If it corrects     the sagittal suture will be
                                                           it,
observed        to leave the neighbourhood of the pubes and approach or
reach the middle  of the plane of the brim. Again,          the uterine               if
axis, or the resultant of the forces of labour, has this posterior
obliquity to the axis of the brim, then, in the first half of its course
through the ligamentous                     pelvis, the foetal head may be expected
to show the Naegele obliquity                    — that          is,   its half lying in the ante
rior half of the pelvis will                    be    lower than that in the posterior as
regards       the plane of the pelvic brim, being pushed down with
greater force        ;   and   it   will   be well worth while to              try whether or not
flexion of the spine will correct this direction of the head [which
I  consider an unnatural direction].

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                                        655
of    its frequent     existence there can be no doubt whatever.                             Its
presence       is indicated     by the deflexion of the uterus from                         the
mesial line to the right or to the left ; and it is well known to be
observed at all times — that             is,
                              before, during, and after pregnancy;
but   as this paper     is   concerned only with dynamical                    matters,      this
deflexion or deviation        is   interesting only as observed              during labour.
On the direction of this deflexion, to right or to left,                       I       have no
remarks to make, but         I     may refer the student first to the recent
paper on this subject by Winkler,* and then to the earlier obser
vations of Spiegelberg        f     on this uterine             position    during labour.
For my present purpose             it   is   more important to have some idea of
the amount of deflexion which occurs.                     With        a   view to ascertain
it, however imperfectly,      I     examined       a   series    of   cases which   I    found
to present this condition.      did not, in all of these cases, make
                                    I
out whether or not the deflexion persisted during uterine action                               ;
but ascertained that
     I                     did so in some of them.
                              it                        hope to make      I
further observations  on this point, but such an inquiry    not essen          is
tial to my present purpose,   being sufficient to know that the devia
                                    it
tion does generally persist during the so-called erection of the
uterus in a pain.
 I    proceeded     as follows.         Having     the pregnant woman               lying flat
on her back,     I   made     out the position of the uterus by feeling its
 outline with my hands         ;   this manipulation            shortly induced         a   pain
 which made the uterine form more distinct                        than previously;          and
 then I    could observe the outline mark the projection of the direc
 tion of the axis on the skin, and notice its just incidence on the
 outline of the fundus.            Then      I   measured        off, as on    a    plane, the
 angle between       the projection of the axis and the vertical line join
 ing the ensiform cartilage and the symphysis pubis.                         I     did not try
 to have guidance         from feeling the uterine angles and the parts
 attached thereto, as Winkler                  has done    in similar circumstances,
 because     T   thought that such guidance would not ensure                           greater
 approach      to accuracy in the measurements              I         wished to make with
a    view to purely dynamical considerations.
     This angle   I    found in five cases to be            8,    10, 11, 14, 15 degrees
 respectively, or on an average about 10 degrees.                         The problem       now

to be solved, is to make out from this angle on the surface of the
spheroid what is the corresponding                                  deflexion of the axis of the
spheroid         ;    and since the angle, as measured                         low down on the sur-
faoe    of the            abdomen             lies in a plane nearly parallel to that in which
the axis of the uterus is deflected from the antero-posterior                                     mesial
plane, the deflexion of the axis may be regarded as nearly iden
tical in amount with the angle measured                                    on the surface.          It   is
probable that this angle of deviation of the axis of the uterus from
the axis of the brim of the pelvis has important physiological                                        and
practical bearings                   ;    but as yet little has been made out regarding
them.            It   has been looked upon as affording some explanation                                 of
the alleged comparative frequency of laceration of the cervix on
the left side in ordinary labour.*                               But the   most       interesting appli
cation of it is to assist in accounting                                for the production of face
cases.   f           It       has    been       shown how, under certain conditions,                  and
supposing                 a     right lateral deviation of the uterus, the part of

cavity of the curvature, will have                              a   greater tendency to descend—
that       is,   to be more powerfully                         pushed downwards than the part
on the right side                    of the brim.             Of this there    can be no doubt    ;   and
the probability of this being                             a   true theory or explanation of face
cases     highly increased by remarking the apt manner in which
           is
other things, known in regard to face presentations, adapt them
selves to it.
   Another ingenious dynamical theory of face presentation has
been started by Schatz.     He states                "
                                        as follows — When the        it                :

resistance around                        by   the walls of the pelvis, a cranial presentation
always occurs,                  if    the occipital           foramen of the foetal head at the
time of the first more important shortening of the long axis of the
uterus           lies backwards from this towards the back                                 of the foetus,

uniform              resistance by the walls of the pelvis, cranial presentation
is   produced             if    the occurring             positive or negative distance of the
great      occipital                foramen towards the back of the foetus from the

long       axis of the uterus multiplied       into the positive or negative
difference of resistance by the walls of the pelvis, is greater on
the posterior side of the foetus than the product of the same factors
on the breast side. In the opposite circumstances face presenta
 tion is produced."* To all this ingenious theorising there can be
 no objection if the conditions are assumed. But the two chief
 premises      are merely assumed    ;  they are not shown to occur      ;  they
 are not shown to be more likely to occur in face presentation cases
 than in others. Under these circumstances, I submit that there
 can be no hesitation in preferring the formerly described theory of
  face cases, where the corresponding assumptions or premises are not
  mere assumptions, but well-known            facts ; I refer to the occasional
  lateral deviation of the uterus, the occasional dolichocephalous
  condition of the head, and the greater liability of cases of the
  second or right occipital position to be transformed into face cases
   than of the first or left occipital position.
       III.   The last curve of the developed genital       passage which falls
   to be considered is the most extensive and the best known.               It  is
   the great curve in the antero-posterior vertical plane, which begins
   about the middle of the third bone of the sacrum and extends
   through the outlet of the ligamentous pelvis to the outlet from the
   soft parts.     Its length may    be greatly diminished        by rupture of
    the perineum, and     still more   if  the sphincter ani is torn through.
    It  forms a curve, whose amount of bending varies from about 60 to
    about 150 degrees.
       In connection with this curve fall       to be studied the synclitic   and
    allied movements of the foetal head during its progress, to which
    Kueneke has recently directed attention, and which have been so
    carefully discussed    at home and abroad,f that       it is unnecessary to
    re-enter upon them here.
        In  connection with this curve have also to be studied the develop
    ment of      the lower    part of     the   genital   passage,  the greater
    development posteriorly      where     the force is particularly   or more
    strongly applied, than anteriorly where there is little more than

   counter-pressure, or pressure      against a fixed wall, and that chiefly
   during the temporary abeyance of the power of parturition.               There
  is to be noted, also, in connection with this curve, the inevitable
   tendency of the force of labour, not merely to distend the perineum,
  but also to rupture it centrally, to force the presenting part through
  it  ; a tendency the study     of which, apart from other considerations,
  leaves    no possible doubt as to the expediency of the practice of
  supporting the perineum, a practice which can be demonstrated to
  favour the maintenance of its entirety.
       A novel practice, founded     upon- what   I regard    as a misapprehen
  sion of the conditions of this curvature, has been recently much
  dwelt upon by Professor Schultze of Jena.*             The practice has for
  its object to facilitate     and promote the advance         of the child after
 its head has reached the floor of the pelvis.          It  is proposed to effect
  this by extension of the spine, with a view to which a hard pillow
  is to be placed beneath the loins as the woman                lies on her back.
  The extension of the spine he believes to increase the posterior
 obliquity of the axis of the uterus, aud therefore of the force of
 labour as exerted in this part. By the change supposed to be thus
 effected in the direction       of the axis of the uterus, the axis of the
 force of labour is brought more nearly to the direction of the axis
 of the outlet of the pelvis, whereby there is supposed to be pro
 duced a diminution of the otherwise necessary loss of power arising
 from the change of direction of the passage at this part.               Schultze
 alleges that he has found this extension of the spine to be useful
 in practice.      If this utility is confirmed and ascertained, nothing,
 of course, can be said against it. But for the enforcement of his
 recommendation of this practice, it is evident that he trusts chiefly
 to theoretical      arguments;     and, therefore,   I  proceed     to examine
them, and believe        I shall  show that they are fallacious.           Before
doing so, it is worth while to point out that the attitude recom
 mended by Schultze         is a very unnatural      one, and that a woman
straining in labour advanced to the stage at present under conside
ration naturally assumes an attitude nearly opposite to that implied
 by extension of the spine, an attitude of some degree of flexion,
an attitude which, keeping         in view the relaxed       state  of the sacro-
     * See Jenaische Zeitschrift fur Medicin, &c. Band iii-., 1867, and Lebrbnch
fur der Hebammenkunat, 1870.

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                                       659
sciatic ligaments, may be accompanied by some degree of enlarge
ment of the outlet by the posterior nutation of the apex of the
sacrum.
   To Schultze's theory of the facilitation of the latter part of the
second stage of labour by extension of the spine several objections
may be made.     First, it is inconsistent with his views as to the
facilitation of the entry of the foetal head into the brim of the
pelvis by flexion of the spine. That view is based upon the assump
tion that the child's head enters the brim of the pelvis so as pretty
nearly to occupy it and have a nearly vertical axis in the axis of
the brim. If this be true of the foetal head at the brim, it will be
true of it during its course, mutatis mutandis, and it will be true
of that part of the body which occupies the brim when                                 the child's
 head is pressing on the perineum.                   It   will   be impossible, therefore,
 by any change of the axis of the uterus to bring the line of the
 labour force to bear upon the perineum in the direction of a straight
 line    as Schultze represents it.             Second, the upper cylindrical solid
 portion of the ligamentous               pelvis, having a length of at least an
 inch and    a half, has a well-determined                axis with which must corre
 spond the axis          of any body fully occupying                   it,  if   the body   is    of
 uniform consistence, — conditions with which the foetus nearly com
 plies.    If   this be the case, the direction               of the force of labour will
 follow the same axis, and no change of its direction above the brim
 of the pelvis, however produced,               can have any effect upon its direc
 tion in any part below the brim                    of the pelvis.               Third, Schultze
 forgets that his practice         is   intended to produce or increase posterior
 obliquity      of the axis of the uterus to the brim, to increase the
 supposed       curve of the natural promontory, and that every addi
 tional degree         of that curve necessarily produces additional loss of
 power.      The       more, then, he extends the spine he                   will diminish    the
 power     of labour available           at the outlet           of   the    pelvis, instead of
 increasing      it,   as he expects.         Fourth,   if   Schultze's      *    views, as illus
 trated by his diagrams, are correct,               a   dangerous amount and direc
 tion of force would be brought                     to bear upon the perineum,                    a
 structure whose            integrity    is   already sufficiently            imperilled     by   a
 force    whose direction         is    gradually    changed as the foetus passes
 through the lower half of the ligamentous pelvis.

  Before concluding                   the consideration of the great curve                    of    the
genital passage                in the anteroposterior vertical mesial plane,                       it   is
necessary        to point           out an important          difficulty introduced into its
study by the change in the condition of the ovum when passing
through     as compared with the ordinary condition of the ovum
               it,
when      passing the pelvic brim.                         Hitherto  I      have    spoken    on the
assumption that the ordinary view of the action of the power                                            of
labour holds good at all parts of the course                                 of the   chili     This
view     is,   that the power              is   uniformly applied by the concave surface
of the approximately spheroidal uterus                              to the uniform surface              of
the approximately                   spheroidal ovum, in            a   direction corresponding
to the axis of the uterus and of the developed genital                                       passage.
Now, this view                 is   probably nearly correct so long as the mem
branes         are    unruptured,               or while    no special part of the foetus
impinges on the uterus so as to injure its approximately spheroidal
form, and provided no part of the foetus impinges on the passage
so as to cause special friction or obstruction at the part impinging.
But while the great anteroposterior vertical curvature of the genital
passage        is    being permeated,             this view   is   no longer tenable, although
even then           it   may, in      a    confessedly inexact way, be advantageously
kept in mind,             if   other more exact conditions are not stated.                    'While
the curve        is   being described,             the membranes        are generally ruptured
and the waters more or less completely discharged;                                     and conse
quently the foetus               is   in   a   variety of places impinging on and chang
ing the form of the propelling uterus, and meeting with frictional
obstruction in the passage at special points more than at others.
These changes introduce an amount of complication of the problem
which damages               greatly the value of such considerations as                      I     have
above     adduced,          and     I      see no means        at present      of overcoming            it
and    of arriving          at exactness,           though there       is   probably no insuper
able    difficulty          in the matter.            Another        element of confusion               is
introduced by the want of uniformity which exists in the composi
tion of the foetus as                  a       mechanical body.         It   is    especially to be
noted that           it   contains     a   longitudinally-placed            elastic beam of con
nected vertebrae, which lies nearer the surface                              of the    mass at one
side than at the other.
   The ovum or feetus, in its passage through the developed genital
canal,    is    subjected           in various circumstances to various rotations on

  some more or less          longitudinally directed axis.       It is also subject,
  in various circumstances, to various revolutions or sinuous deflexions,
  in which its long axis           moves through portions      of curves which    are
  measured        by corresponding        angles.    On these    curves and their
  influence      I   have made       a few remarks while      feeling deeply their
  imperfection and the need of much further observation and research.
  The student who has followed the argument in this paper will                  have
  observed      the resort to inferences when direct observations would
  have been       preferable.       This remark applies to every subject dis
  cussed   in it   ;  and while it is to be greatly regretted that such is the
  case,  it is at the     same time not to be forgotten        that no method of
 making direct and exact observations has hitherto been discovered.
 The adoption of the homalographic                   method is surrounded with
 difficulties, not only in the method itself, but also in the procuring
 of subjects on which             to use  it ; and while results obtained by it
 would be of great interest and importance,               it is evident that they
 would not be complete or sufficient, for they can never be other than
 observations on parts in the repose of death, not in the turgescence
 and action of life.           Until very recently, all our knowledge of the
 force of labour was on a like imperfect footing; but already ingenuity
 has suggested a means of basing this subject on exact observations,
 and Schatz has availed himself of these means, and greatly assisted
 us to arrive at results which we regard as probably the most impor
 tant hitherto achieved in obstetric science.             Till some ingenuity has
 succeeded       in devising     means   of making like exact observations         to
 settle the points discussed in this paper, wo must be content to do
 our best to reach the truth by reasoning on what we do know more
 or less exactly.        And it should     be remembered that, by this method,
we may reach the greatest assurance,              if not certainty.    A boy, play
ing with his dissected           puzzle-map, may be certain that a county is
rightly placed         if it  fits exactly into an entire hole formed of the
conterminous          boundaries of surrounding         counties, especially   if it
also fits in nowhere else.            So a theory which      suits itself to all, or
is in opposition to none, of numerous known conterminous condi
tions, may be, provisionally           at least, assumed to be correct, and such
assumption of correctness             will vary with the number and testing
character of the conditions so humoured by the theory.

   3.  On a Method of Determining the Explosive Power                       of
        Gaseous Combinations.             By James Dewar, Esq.
                                  (Abstract.)
    The  author    describes   an    apparatus by means          of which    the
explosive    power of gaseous         combinations      can easily be deter
mined,    and  from this, by Bunsen process,           the temperature      may
readily  be calculated.      The essential feature of the apparatus is
the registration of the
                             " compression volume " of a given initial
volume of air, on which the gaseous explosive mixture has been
allowed to act. As the duration of the pressure is all but instan
taneous, the well-known       formula
                             S-(vOM
may be employed to ascertain the final pressure, more especially as
the sudden rebound prevents any great loss         of  heat.    In order to test
the apparatus   many experiments were made with mixtures of hydro
gen   and oxygen, and the mean result arrived at was a condensa
tion to one-fifth    the original     volume of air (the initial volume
being measured      at 30 in. bar), when pure electrolytic gas was
employed.      This is equivalent to      a pressure     of  9 •5 atmospheres,
and therefore agrees with Bunsen's previous determination.                  The
author hopes     to  be able to execute a series           of determinations
under varying conditions of temperature and pressure.
   4. Note on Sprengel's         Mercurial Air- Pump.             By  J ames
                                Dewar, Esq.
   The ordinary      Sprengel,    requiring   careful     manipulation,     and
being apt to get out of order, has not yet become an essential
piece  of lecture apparatus    as  it ought to be.      The author exhibited
to the Society two modifications adapted        to  lecture illustration. In
both instruments the mercury receptacle is made of iron, and instead
of the india-rubber joint of       the original,   a well -ground iron stop
cock is substituted, the portion of iron tube before the stopcock
terminating in a Y-shaped piece bored out of the solid.                  In the
one form the drop-tube is of glass, attached by means                of marine

glue ; in the other, of carefully          made  india-rubber   tube four or
five millimetres in thickness, of         a very small uniform    bore, made
expressly for the purpose by           the   Edinburgh Rubber Company.
The     iron funnel-shaped receptacles are ground at the inner apex,
so   as to fit perfectly finely-ground     iron tubes.   By  means   of  these
tubes the preliminary exhaustions are made by                a hand    pump,
and then they are withdrawn.           This device saves    a separate  joint.
The barometer tubes        are attached to solid T-shaped     pieces  of iron
tube, and between        these   pieces   and the main tubes each has a
small glass bulb. Both forms work for all practical purposes as
 well as glass, and suit admirably for Frankland's water analyses,
 and Graham's experiments, &c.               They may be procured from
 Mr Cameron, philosophical instrument maker, South Bridge, Edin
 burgh.

   (Nitride   o^Tc'iXw',.
  The examination of the physiological                        action of such salts proved
that, while differing from one another in many respects, there are
two points      in which they           agree — they      all paralyse the end-organs
of the motor nerves, and none of them possess that stimulating
action of the spinal cord which we observe in such substance as              a
strychnia.
  Some years ago    Von (Efele discovered that the sulphide of ethyl
forms    compound with the iodide of ethyl, exactly as the nitride
         a
of ethyl (triethylamine) does. To this new salt he gave the name
of iodide of triethylsulphin, and from      obtained the hydrated
                                                              it
oxide and various other compounds of triethylsulphin.                               The num
ber of known salts of this type has been increased by Cahours and
Dehn.
  As there       are two ways       in which the salts of the ammonium                        bases
may be represented, — 1st, as molecular compounds of nitrides with
ethers   ;    and 2d, as compounds of pentad nitrogen, — so the salts of
the sulphin bases may be represented, either, 1st, as molecular com
pounds of sulphides with ethers; or, 2d, as compounds of tetrad
sulphur.
  As our physiological observations had led us to prefer the second
mode of representing the constitution of the salts of the ammonium
bases,   it   appeared       to us that     it     would be of interest to examine
the physiological        action of the salts of the sulphin bases.                   We have
accordingly commenced with the simplest salts of this type, viz.,
the salts      of trimethylsulphin,          and have made           a   number of experi
ments with the iodide and the sulphate of that radical.                            The iodide
was employed in the form                  of pure white crystals           ;   the sulphate,

which is an excessively deliquescent salt, was employed in the
form of an aqueous solution of known strength. We found that
the action of the two salts was identical, the difference of dose
being nearly proportional to the chemical equivalent. In the case
of warm-blooded animals the symptoms observed were — increas
ing    weakness of the voluntary muscles ending with fatal doses in
 asphyxia, considerable contraction of the pupils, and profuse sali
 vation.
     In the case of frogs complete paralysis of the voluntary muscles
 was produced, along with a remarkable stiffness of the muscles of
 the anterior part of the body.        By experiments conducted exactly
 as described in former papers read before the Society, we proved
 that the paralysis of the voluntary muscles was caused by the
 destruction of the function of the motor end-organs, the nerve
 trunks and the muscular fibres being still active. In fact, the
 action of these salts is almost identical with that of the salts of
  tetramethyl-ammonium,         as formerly described by us.
     We intend     to continue these    investigations, and to extend them
  to the corresponding compounds of selenium and tellurium                   and
  to the    remarkable    series  of salts derived from Se(CH2)aCl, and
  Te(CH,)sCL.,    such as Se(CH^OHNO.,, &c.
       2. On the Mean        Monthly Rainfall of Scotland.               By
                            Alexander Buchan.
     So  far as regards the annual amounts         of the rainfall of Scotland,
  deduced from observations made at 296 different            places,   the chief
  point brought out is the enormous difference between              the rainfall
  of the west and that of the east     ;  the stations along the west coast
  showing such figures as 40, 45, and 54 inches, as compared with
  24, 27, and 30 inches at stations on the east coast, not situated in
  the immediate neighbourhood         of hills.   When it is considered that
  the source   of the rainfall is the prevailing south-westerly winds, it
  is evident   that the comparative dryness of such districts             as the
  south shore of the     Firth of Forth is    due to   high land lying to the
  south-west, which drains the winds of         a large portion of their mois
  ture in their passage across them.        On the other hand, in the West
   Highlands, where arms of the sea open in upon the land in all direc

666                    Proceedings         of the Royal      Society
t   ions from south round to west, the case is that                  of     a   high district,
with currents of moist air poured in upon                    it,   and the consequence
is,   an enormous rainfall,              amounting,     for example, at Glencroe to
128 inches, and at the head              of Lochlomond to         115 inches.         Between
these       extremes the amount of the rainfall varies, the variations
being dependent on the physical configuration of the surface.
  The monthly average rainfall has been examined by the dis
cussion of observations made at 126 places for long terms of years
— the number of years varying from          10 to 60, and the whole averag
ing       21 years.   Of the stations dealt with, 54 are on the west slope,
and 72 on         the east slope.  The mean annual rainfall for the -whole
country, deduced from these averages,                 is   44 inches   ;    for the eastern
slope 38 inches, and for the western slope 50 inches, —amounts
which are probably not far from the true averages of these different
regions.
      In December, the general                average      for the whole country             is
greatly above         the average                     fall; in May                 falls to the
                                                                           it it
                                           monthly
minimum, after which                it   continues to increase       till          again rises
considerably above the monthly average in October, to fall again,
however, to about the average                 in November. The curve of the
rainfall of the       east, as      compared with that of the west, shows the
wet and dry seasons to              be less strongly marked in the east or the        ;
departures from          the monthly           averages     are    larger in the west.
Since, however, the curves closely resemble each other, the general
causes  bringing about the deposition of rain in the west and in                           the
east are the same.    But at all seasons the absolute amount of                            the
rainfall    greater in the west than in the east.

May    in the north, and June in Orkney, Shetland, and Faro; and
it   is   remarkable that these same months are the months of largest
(or very large) rainfall in various extensive regions on the continent
of Europe.

     "When the linear           and vector function                        expressing a strain is self-
conjugate the strain is pure. When it is not self-conjugate, it may be
broken up into pure and rotational parts in various ways (analogous
to the       separation of a quaternion into the sum of a scalar and a vec
tor   part, or into the product of a tensor and a versor part), of which
two     are particularly        noticeable.                    Denoting by a bar a self-conjugate
function,         we have thus either
                     p =    *   +   V.       f(          ),
 where       c   is a vector, and            q a     quaternion (which                  may obviously be
 regarded as a mere versor).
    That this is possible is seen from the fact that p involves nine
 independent         constants, while                    \fi   and w each involve six, and                 e   and
 q   each three.       If   <p'   be the function conjugate to                                we have

  course, perfectly well known in quaternions, but                                       it   does not     seem
  to have been noticed as               a    theorem in the kinematics of strains that
  there    is                            of resolving strain into the

  the angle of rotation.

       the second form (whose solution does not appear to have been

 which alone was founded the investigation     of my former article.
    10. Going back to the analytical definition of    in     (5), we see                   Q    §   3
 that when none of the movable solids        perforated, this configur-   is
 ational function              is     equal to the whole kinetic energy (E), which
 the polycyclic            motion would have were there no movable solid,
 diminished by the energy                           (W) which would                      be given up were the
 liquid, which on this supposition flows through                                              the   space       of the
 movable solid or solids, suddenly rigidified                                            and brought to rest.
 Putting then
                                                    <U   =   E   -   W          .                   .       (24),
 and remarking                that         E   is   independent           of the co-ordinates of the
 movable solids, we may put                              —   W in place of                Q   in the equations
 of motion, which, for this slight modification, need not be written

      11.   I conclude            with a very simple case, the subject of my com
munication to the Royal Society of last December, in which the
result was given without proof.                            Let there          be only one moving body,
and it spherical              ;   let the perforated solid or solids be reduced to an
infinitely fine immovable rigid curve or group of curves (endless, of
course, that            is,
                 either finite and closed, or infinite), and let there be
no other fixed solid.     The rigid curve or curves will be called the
"core" or "cores," as their part           simply that of core for the
                                                                 is
cyclic or polycyclic motion.                           In   this case         it    is   convenient to take
for         <p,   6,   the rectangular co-ordinates (x, y,z) of the centre of the
movable globe.                    Then,        because       the cores,             being infinitely            fine,
offer no obstruction to the motion of the liquid, making way for the
globe moving through                     it,     we have

 This corresponds           ito the formula      which     I  gave twenty-five years
 ago     for    the   force experienced by a small sphere (whether of

     14.   By taking       an infinite straight    line for the core      a simple    but
 very important          example is afforded.        In    this case, the undisturbed
 motion of the fluid is in circles having their centres in the core
 (or axis, as we may now call it), and their planes perpendicular to
 it. As is well known, the velocity of irrotational revolution round
 a straight axis is inversely proportional                to distance from the axis.
 Hence the potential function              W for the force experienced by an
 infinitesimal solid sphere in the fluid is inversely as the square of
 the distance of its centre from the axis, and therefore the force is
 inversely as the cube of the distance, and is towards the nearest
 point of the axis.             Hence, when the globule moves in a plane
 perpendicular to the axis, it describes one or other of the forms of
 Cotesian spirals       f.     If it be projected obliquely          to the axis, the
 component velocity parallel to the axis will remain constant, and
 the other component will be unaffected by that one                     ;  so that the
 projection of the globule on the plane perpendicular to the axis
 will always describe the same Cotesian spiral as would be described
 were there no motion parallel to the axis.                    If  the globule be left
 to itself in any position it will commence                moving towards the axis
 as  if attracted by       a force varying      inversely as the cube of the dis
tance.        It  is remarkable that       it traverses      at  right angles     an in
creasing liquid current without                any applied force to prevent it

from being (as we might erroneously at first sight expect it to be)
carried sideways with the augmented stream.     A properly trained
dynamical intelligence would at once perceive that the constancy
of moment of momentum round the axis requires the globule to
move directly towards it.
     15. Suppose now the globule to be of the same                             density as the
liquid. If (being infinitely small) it is projected in the direc
tion and with the velocity of the liquid's motion, it will move
round the axis in the same circle with the liquid ; but this motion
would be unstable [and the neglected term w (39) adds to the in
stability]. Compare Tait and Steele's " Dynamics of a Particle,"

is drawn    in to the axis (except the extreme one in which its
velocity is infinitely little less than that of the fluid, and its spiral
path infinitely nearly perpendicular to the radius vector), the spiral
by which it approaches,     although it has always an infinite number
of convolutions, is of finite length      ; and therefore, of course, the

to work out the solution.
     The notation and method will be understood from the simple
 case of a matrix of the second order.                    I write

                         a
     County of Perth, having on one of its sides Cups and
     Grooves, apparently artificial. By D. Milne Home.
     About      a   year ago, the Council of this Society appointed a Com
mittee to make inquiry about boulders in Scotland.
     The Committee intend                   to submit to the Council                      a   general report
of their proceedings, showing the progress made.
     The object of the present notice                             is   to give to the Society                  an
account of one of the boulders reported to the Committee,                                                 as   t
specimen of the information which they have been obtaining.
     The Rev.        Mr Herdman, minister of Rattray, in Perthshire,                                      sent
to the Committee an answer to their circular, specifying                                           the follow
ing boulders and standing stones in his parish                               :       —

                             of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                                                   GS3
     1st,    A stone known from time immemorial                              as the Standing Stone
of   Glenballoch.
  This boulder is angular,                 and rudely pyramided                  in form.            Its entire
height is 12 feet. At its                   base      it is about       8   feet square          ;   and half
way       up, about 6 feet square.                   Its weight is estimated                     at about 25
tons.
     It     rests    on what       Mr Herdman               describes          as a firm, hard, dry,
sandy, reddish yellow clay, called by the farmers of the district,
till.
     On one side of this stone, viz., that facing the glen, on the north
bank of which it stands, there are cuttings or incisions, which                                                Mr
Herdman,             and others skilled              in    archaeology          who have examined
them, believe to be artificial.                        These incisions               are   of two kinds             :
First, hemispherical cavities, about twelve or thirteen in number                                                   ;
and second, grooves                which     on some points touch or run into these
cavities.
     2d,     In      another       part of       the same            estate,     viz.,     of Craighall,
belonging to Colonel Clark Rattray, there is a spot                                      known as " The
Stannin' Stanes."                  This    name        occurs in the parish records,                           Mr
Herdman             says, so far back as 300 years.                     There was a small farm
long known by the name of "Stannin' Stanes;" and about forty years
ago,        there were dwelling-houses                     at the place,             forming         a    hamlet
which bore the same name.
   Though there is only                   one large stone at this place,                   Mr Herdman
is of opinion that it once                had companions.                These have disappeared.
They are probably in dykes and cattle sheds, not far off.
  The stone which remains,      in length above ground, about
                                                     is,                                                        5
feet, and         is   about   4   feet square.            It   is   believed to be sunk in the
ground        3     feet.    Its weight         is   estimated at           8   or   9   tons.       It   stands
upright.
     3d, There          is   a   group     of    stones,    each      containing           about         7   cubic
yards of rock, and each weighing, probably, about 14 tons, situated
on the farm  of Glenballoch, not far from the large stone first men
tioned. Lines joining these stones would form an irregular square.
                                                4
The intervals between the stones are from    to 12 feet.  The stone    9
at the south-west                angle      is   higher         than the        others,      reaching           to
a    point    5     feet above the ground.                 The other three            stones lie on their
sides.

684                 Proceedings      of the Royal Society
    4th, There    is another group     of stones,  five or six in number,     on
Hatton    Hill, about   500 yards to the east of the       hill top, and about
20 feet below its level.       Each of these stones is on average         about
a cubic yard in solid content, and weighs about two tons.
    Hatton   Hill  is at its top about 900 feet above the sea.       The   farm
of Glenballoch,     on which most     of the other    stones are, is about 750
feet above the sea.
    To revert now to the stone first mentioned, the annexed              wood
cut will give an idea of its shape.             The cups or cavities     on its
sides  — which, however,       are not well shown on the diagram          — are
from    2 to 3 inches in diameter, and from half an inch to one inch
deep.     The   grooves    are about   half   an inch deep and about half
an inch wide.
    The cup-shaped cavities         were   first noticed about     fourteen     or
fifteen years ago, by the Rev.       Mr Herdman,      and were shown by him
to  I)r Wise,   a well-known      archaeologist.     At that time the part of
the stone above the surface of the ground             measured alout 9 J feet

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                         685
from the top, and in that part of the stone there were only five or
six cups discernible ; plaster casts of these, however, were taken
and sent to the Society of Scottish Antiquaries.                   No doubt was
entertained by those who then examined the stone and the casts,
that these cup cavities were artificial and not natural.
    About six years ago the late Sir James Simpson turned his atten                .
tion to the subject of these antique and mysterious cuttings                   and
sculpturings, and drew out a memoir on the subject, illustrated                 by
numerous        lithographs,     which     was    published   by the Society     of
 Antiquaries.
    Mr Herdman having heard of this inquiry,                was induced to make
a farther examination         of the   stone, and had some of the earth cleared
away from its sides.         He then discovered other hemispherical cavities
sharper and more          distinct than those in the higher and more ex
posed    part of the stone, and which greater distinctness               he natu
rally ascribed to the covering of earth by which they had been
protected from the weather. He also on this occasion observed
that there were grooves or ruts on the surface of the stone, in the
parts which         had been      covered     up,  and which     were   prolonged
into grooves on the upper part of the stone where they were more
faint.
    It will  be seen from the diagram,— first, that on the middle of
 the stone and near the cups there are two long grooves,                   with a
 cross   groove at two places        ;  second, that at the   right hand there is
 a zigzag      groove   ;   and third,     that at the left hand there is a
 straight   groove, running up vertically,             but more faint than the
 others.    The      second   and third of these        grooves   were  only dis
 covered lately, and       in consequence      of investigations for the Boulder
 Committee.
    Whenever        the discovery of these additional          cups and grooves
 was made,     Mr Herdman lost no time in sending             an account of them
 to  Sir James Simpson.            But by this time his memoir had been
 printed ; and the only notice which appears in that memoir of
 the Glenballoch Stone, is in the following terms, p. 15 : —
    " Circle at Craighall, Perthshire. — Cup excavations exist
                                                                          upon  an
 erect stone standing at a megalithic            circle behind Craighall House,
 Blairgowrie.        The cups    are five or six in number, and placed        in a
 group near the foot of the stone."

     The account is incorrect in       several particulars.     Instead of there
  being only five or six cups, there are thirteen or fourteen.                The
  four vertical and three transverse grooves are not mentioned.             There
  is no reason to suppose that a circle of stones ever existed here.            In
  fact the rapid slope of the ground, where the boulder stands, woul J
  have prevented such a circle being made.               Megalithic circles are
 always on a flat piece of land.           Sir James Simpson was never at
 Glenballoch, as he     told Mr Herdman himself shortly before his
 death.
     Whilst to Mr Herdman belongs the merit of discovering these
 markings, the still greater merit belongs to him of having saved
 this boulder from the fate which has befallen several others in his
 parish,   and   hundreds,      or   probably     thousands,    equally   curious
 throughout     Scotland.      The boulder stands within the precincts of
 a field which bears good      crops, and as it was a considerable obstruc
 tion to farming      operations, the tenant about six' years ago was
preparing to break it up, and the more especially as he was then in
want of stones       for a new farm-house.              His intentions    having
become     known, the Rev.       Mr Herdman would have applied to the
proprietor himself had he been at home, to save the boulder.                  But
he was abroad;      and so the factor was appealed to, and fortunately
with   success.
     The tenant   has several times since thrown out dark hints about
the inconvenience      to which he is exposed by the presence of this
boulder in an arable field, and also by the occasional visits of the
curious to examine        it.   He has recently spoken of the            damage
                         "
done to his " neeps           by Mr Herdman's excavations; and it was
only after much persuasion that Mr Herdman obtained from him
a promise in these words, 'Weel,
                                   "         I'll  lat the stane alane,    if you
dinna howk muckle mair about it."                 Notwithstanding this assur
ance,    Mr Herdman       thinks it might         be as  well that the Royal
Society Committee should communicate with the proprietor, Col.
Clark Rattray, and ask him to give strict orders for the preservation
of the boulder.
    These remarks apply to the Glenballoch stone only in its archaeo
logical relations.     But it is probably        also interesting geologically.
Mr Herdman       states that he has not much knowledge             of rocks, and
no experience in geological           researches.      Nevertheless, the facts

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                             687
related by him suggest some questions of considerable importance.
He    has had the kindness to send chips           of all the    stones   specified
by him.       Mr Herdman       describes   them    as,  in his opinion,    a black
coloured trap.       But they appear to be all bits of micaceous schist.
 The prevailing rock in the parish of Rattray is a coarse red sand
 stone— probably Old Red Sandstone, containing thick beds of coarse
 conglomerate.
     The nearest rocks of micaceous schist             are   in the hills to the
 north and west.         How far off they      are  it is not stated, nor how
 much higher in level than Rattray parish.                 But it is pretty evi
 dent that all these boulders came from the hills, and by natural
 agency of some kind. The stone of Glenballoch, weighing as it
 does 25 tons, must have come in that way;              and it is almost certain
 that    it now occupies the spot and position on which it was
 originally placed. The other stones specified by Mr Herdman
 probably do not now occupy their original site and position, as
 they seem to have been set up for the purposes                 — whatever    these
  were —for which      they were wanted.        Probably the group of stones
  near the top of Hatton         Hill   are  in their      original position, for
  they do not seem to be artificially arranged             ;  and, moreover,    it is
  not uncommon to find boulders in heaps                 near the tops of hills,
  as  if  these  hills had somehow obstructed the farther               progress   of
  the agent (whatever that was), which transported the boulders,
  and caused it to discharge its cargo on or near the top of the
  hill.
     Assuming, then, that the stone of Glenballoch              is an erratic from
   some    northern or westerly point, one question would be, What
   caused   the   transporting   agent to drop it at the place             where it
   now stands?       Why should it not have been carried farther? Per
   haps an    examination of the country might suggest data to aid in
   the solution   of this question.
      The position of the boulder and its attitude              appear   to deserve
   attention,   provided    it can  be   correctly    assumed      that they were
   received by natural and not by human agency.
      Mr Herdman      states that the boulder stands        in a field which slopes
   pretty rapidly     down towards a stream, running through a narrow
   glen.    This field   seems   to form one side of that glen, or small
   valley, through which, he says, there was formerly a pass much

688                     Proceedings          of the Royal       Society
frequented between   Craighall and Banff; and "battoch'' is a
Celtic word for "past."  How high above the bottom of the glen
the boulder stands,            Mr Herdman            does not explain.       The boulder,
therefore, stands in rather                 a    critical position    ;   and considering
its great weight, it does not seem likely that it could have been
put into that position by human agency.
     Then its attitude is singular,              because      boulders having a longer
and shorter axis are generally and naturally found lying with                           their
longer axis parallel            with       the ground;        but this boulder        has     its
longer axis vertical, and stands on a basis of only 8 feet square.                            If
the present position and attitude are those it received when it                              fell
from the agent which transported                      it,   what was the nature of the
agent which allowed            it   to fall, so as to take that attitude       ?
     The two theories for            the transport     of such boulders       are land ice,
as by      a    glacier, and floating ice, as by an                 iceberg or ice floe.
Whether the country between Rattray parish and the mountains to
the north       is   of such   a   nature as to have allowed the formation of a
glacier may be         a   question, but supposing             it   were, which      of these
two ice agents, glacier or floating ice, would have been most likely
to cause this pear-shaped block to fall into the position and attitude
which      it   occupies?          This     is   a   question as much for         a   mathe
matician as for        a   geologist to solve.
5.    On    the       Fruiting of the Ipecacuan
                                           Plant (Cephaelis
     Ipecacuanha, Rich.) in the Royal Botanic Garden.  By
     Prof. Balfour.
     The cultivation           of the Ipecacuan             plant   in this country          has
received       an impetus from the demand on the           pait of His Grace the
Duke of Argyll, for            a   large supply of fresh plants for India. The
object of the India office             is   to cultivate the plant extensively,             and
thus prevent the evils which might arise from scarcity of a drug
which    is    so important in the treatment                of dysentery.     The risk        of
such an occurrence              is   due    to the mode in which the                 plant    is
gathered in Brazil, and the want of care in preserving it.                        A   similar
fate threatens Ipecacuan as that which has occurred                         in the    cose of
Cinchona.

                       of Edinburgh,     Session 1871-72.                      689
      The Secretary of State for India    has,  in the first place, endeavoured
to    introduce the plant from this country — leaving for after considera
tion       the propriety of getting specimens sent direct from Rio Janeiro
to       India.   The plants in this country have been supplied from
various sources.         The original specimen, cultivated by Sir William
 Hooker in Glasgow, came from Liege, and the Messrs Lawson have
 imported recently a quantity of specimens from Belgium and
 Germany. In the Royal Botanic Garden of Edinburgh we are in
 debted for specimens — first, to Sir William Hooker; and, secondly,
  to Dr Gunning of Palmeiras, Rio Janeiro. Sir Robert Christison
  has taken a warm interest in the subject, and has aided much in
  procuring specimens. Mr M'Nab found that by cutting the root of
  the original garden plant he could propagate it easily, and in this
  way he secured        a large stock.    He gave to the Botanical Society
  of Edinburgh a notice of his mode of cultivation.                 This account
  was printed for the India office, and copies of it were extensively
   distributed.     The specimens from Rio Janeiro            were   treated in a
  similar manner.
      The plants were sent to India in Wardian cases, sometimes under
  charge of gentlemen of the forest department going to India, and
  sometimes without any one in charge.             The results   have been very
  successful.
      The Duke of Argyll       has forwarded to me a report by       Dr G. King,
   superintendent of the Botanic Garden, Calcutta, to whose care the
  cases were consigned.
   From Dr G. King, Superintendent, Botanic Garden, Calcutta,                to the
                     Secretary  to the Government     of Bengal.
       "  I have the honour to report, for the information      of Government,
   the arrival from England of five consignments of Ipecacuanha
   plants.     Five of these consignments, consisting of a single case
   each, were brought out under the care of Messrs           Walton, Whittall,
   Jellicoe, Ferrais,     and Gamble,     officers   newly   appointed     to the
   Forest Department.        The sixth, consisting of three      closed  Wardian
   cases, came     as deck-baggage on board         the Suez Canal       steamer,
   '
     City of Mecca,' under the special care of no one.
      " As will be seen by the following tabular statement,              the total
   number of plants despatched from England was 277.                   On arrival

    " It   will  be observed       that the mortality and sickness                  has been
greatest amongst the plants brought out under the care of the
members       of the Forest Department.                I    have no doubt this result
is due to over-kindness during the voyage.                      The plants have been
apparently freely watered and over-shaded ; and in the close and
moist atmosphere of the cases, unnatural                     forced growth has           been
the result.       Mr Gamble's consignment is                 an exception, the plants
brought out by him being in quite as good health as those that came
untended in the          '
                           City of Mecca.'          The condition of          the latter is
wonderfully good, and indicates extreme care in the selection of
plants, and in the mode of packing them.
    " As   soon as the plants shall have              recovered      a   little from their
journey,     I propose      to despatch them to        Sikkim.
    "  I   take    this    opportunity       of stating that the twelve                plants
brought out in        July    last by   Mr Walton        were forwarded to Sikkim
three months ago, and that eleven                   of them      are now in excellent
order    ;  the twelfth        unfortunately        died during         the     journey      to
Sikkim.
    " The condition of the eleven
                                               plants just alluded to, of the              five
old plants formerly sent from this garden to Sikkim, and of                                 the
young ones propagated from them, leads me to entertain hopes that
in that province the Ipecacuanha experiment will bo attended with
great success."
    A question       has been started whether there are not                       plants      in
India which         may be used           as  Ipecacuan.         One of these is            the
 Tylophora asthmatica,          W.     et  A.,  an Asclepiadaceous            plant, which

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                         691
has been known under various names             : — Gynanchum Ipecacuanha,
Willd.; Asclepias    asthmatica,   Roxb.  Fl. Ind.; Gynanchum vomitorium,
Lam. Dr Roxburgh and Dr Anderson                 used the plant for dysentery
in India with great success.
   There are some peculiar features         in the plant now under culti
vation which require investigation, and            I  am not able to give a
full  paper   on the whole subject       until further       cultivation.    The
plant which has been long in the garden has flowered regularly.
Even the young cuttings have sent forth their flowers. The plant,
on the other hand, sent from Rio Janeiro, although treated in the
same way as the other, has not flowered.*
    The former, although flowering freely, has not produced perfect
fruit until the present year. The plants were carefully fertilised
by the application of the pollen of           one flower to the stigma         of
another.     By this means we have secured a number of fruiting
specimens, and     I  now exhibit fruiting plants with drawings of the
fruit and sections.
   The fruit is    drupaceous,    of  a dark purple      colour, shining and
glossy on the outside.        It is about the size of a large currant, and
when ripe it falls off easily.      Each fruit contains two seeds.         These
are seen    in the section of the fruit.         The albumen of the       seed is
very hard.     I  have   not seen any figure of the fruit in botanical
works    containing     plates of the plant.         There is a resemblance
between it and that of Psychotria emetica.
   We expect that      some of the seeds     will ripen, and that       we shall
then be able to propagate the plant from seed.

Professor Sir ROBERT CHRISTISON, Bart., President.
                   in the Chair.
      The following Communications                   were read       :   —
    1.    On Cardiocarpon.          By Professor Duns, D.D. , F.R.S.E.,
                                   New College.
   The attention of the Society was called to many beautiful speci
mens of Sphenopteris laid on the table.   These had been obtained
by Dr Duns and his predecessor,   Dr  Fleming, from the old work
ings in the Burdiehouse limestones, near Edinburgh, well known
from Hibbert's Memoir (1835), and from the papers of more recent
observers.         The   species   exhibited       were    chiefly   S. artemisiaefolia
and S. affints. An Antholite (A. Pitcairnice) was also shown, in
which the pedicels that spring from the flower-like buds in the
axils of the bracts, sub-opposite in the spike, are well represented.
The author then referred to Cardiocarpon, Brong., and to the
species named by Brongniart, Lindley, and Hutton, and more
recently by Dawson and Lesquereux.                        It   was pointed out, that
very many Cardiocarpa occur in association with the specimens                              of
Sphenopteris         on the table.      On three of these alone there are
above       160.    Of   these, some   are almost globular, others are oval.
Some taper to a single sharp point             ;   others, and the majority, have
an       acute   bifid apex.    In   many the medial ridge is not seen,                    in
others it is highly marked.            In   a few this ridge has an excurrent
appearance,        both at the apex and at the supposed                  point of attach
ment to the plant.          Many of the forms             are so placed as to present
an appearance of organic connection with the Sphenopterides. The
author then showed that it " is needful to guard against a tendency
to give undue importance to the mere fact of association. If in
other departments this has lead to most erroneous inferences,                              it
will      be sure to mislead    in the study of      palaeobotany.           Some weight
is,      no doubt, to be given to the fact, but to use            it     to any extent as
a   guide in determining the affinities of fossil plants                     is,   to say the
least, not safe.         Principal Dawson          has pointed       to the occurrence

of Cardiocarpa along with the stems of Sigillaria as corroborative
of the theory of the conifer or cycad character of Sigillaria.
He says, " Some botanists, conspicuous among whom is Brongniart,
hold that Sigillaria were gymnospermous plants allied to Cycadaceae.
Others are disposed        to regard them as Acrogens, and as closely
allied    to   Lycopodiaceae                        In favour of    the former
view we may adduce            the exogenous       structure of    the stem     of
Sigillaria, and     the  obvious affinity of its tissues to   these  of conifers
and cycads,      as well as the constant association with trees of this
genus of the evidently phanerogamous fruits, known as Trigono-
carpum and Cardiocarpum."            And he adds, " The higher Sigillarice
unquestionably       resemble    cycads in the structure of their stems.
Their long, rigid, narrow        leaves   may be compared to single pinnae
of the leaves of cycads.             Their    cord-like  rootlets, as    I  have
ascertained by actual comparison, are similar to those of cycads.
If    their fruit was of the nature of Cardiocarpon or Trigonocarpum,
this would also correspond."            (See Quarterly    Journal of    the Geo
logical Society, May 1871.) This assumes throughout that palaeo-
botanists are agreed as to the nature of these fossil fruits, which is
far from being the case.
     In  August     1870,  Mr C. W. Peach, to whom Scottish natural
science      is so much indebted, found specimens of Cardiocarpon
organically united with a plant long known by the name, Antholites
Pitcairnice.        The specimens        were   obtained from carboniferous
shale at Cleuch, near Falkirk.             Specimen No. 16, on the table, is
Antholites Pitcairniot,      from shale near Bathgate.         By the kindness
of Mr Peach, I am able to show the Society an               example of Antho
 lites with the fruit organically attached.           The importance of this
 discovery is at once recognised.           In a department where facts are
 the letters, and their association the words by which we read the
 history of creative manifestation, every worker will acknowledge
 the value of an observation like that referred to, even though he
 may dot see his way to accept views implying generic identity
 between the fruit now associated with Antholites and Cardiocarpon.
 On the assumption of this identity,             Mr Carruthers     has recently
 limited the term Antholites to the place, or rather the use assigned
                             "

Along with a figure of the        Falkirk specimen, another        is given froin
an unknown         locality,  supposed    to be from mines in Derbyshire.
The fruit       on   the latter is regarded as similar         to Cardiocarpcm
acutum of      Lindley.
     It was stated      that, so far as the author is aware, there is no
certain record as to the form of the fructification           of  such  Sphenop-
terides as 8. arlemisusfolia andV?.         afflnis, or, indeed, of any of the
 species closely related to these          by their bipinnate leaf and the
 deep pinnatifid segments        of their leaflet. Goeppert and Unger's
 statement, that the fructification is -" punctiform or marginal," may
 be   true of species like S. dilata, or S. latior         (Dawson), but these
 differ widely from the specimens now noticed, though they bear
 some resemblance         to living forms.       As regards S. artemisiafolia,
 Brongniart himself has said, that he has not been able to find the
 least resemblance between it and living ferns.              It  was shown    that
 this remark is especially applicable to S. affinis.                The question
 seemed to be raised by what might be said to be the almost constant
 association of Gardiocarpa          with   these    two species,    " Have they

                                                                    "   Dr Duns

 stated    in conclusion, that while     these species must     still be regarded
  as true     ferns, and while      the idea even        of organic connection
 between such forms as the samaroid fruit Cardiocarpon                     and the
 species S. artemisicefolia,      and S. affinis is opposed to all accepted
  views of plant affinity, yet the association, as shown in the numerous
  specimens on the table, is so frequent, and often so remarkably like
  organic, as to call for the attention of observers.
  2.   On the Composition of the Flesh of the Salmon in the
      " Clean" and " Foul" condition.
                                                  By Sir Robert Christison,
      Bart.
      Having had occasion lately to fill up some blanks in a table of
  the Nutritive Value of different kinds of Food, I was unable to
  find for the purpose an analysis of the flesh of the Salmon.
  I   have   therefore made such an analysis as is necessary              ; and as

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                     .     695
tbe     results may be useful to others,       I   beg to offer them to the
Society.
     I  first examined the composition of a very fine " Clean
                                                                            "
                                                                               fish,
caught in the estuary of the Tay in May last year,              and    weighing
20 pounds.         I  have  never seen a finer fish from that far-famed
salmon-river.
      I have   also, in contrast with   this, examined a      "Foul"       fish, or
 Kelt, taken in the beginning of March last from                 a pool where
 spawned fish are known to congregate at that season in the Isla, a
 principal tributary of the Tay. It weighed 27 pounds the day
 after it was caught, and would probably have weighed 35 pounds
 in good condition.        In  order to account for my being in lawful
 possession of such an article,       I must mention that       I owe    it to the
  consent of the Commissioners for the Tay Fisheries, whose kind
  ness in presenting, for a scientific object, what otherwise cannot be
  easily obtained without infringing the law, may receive, as              I  hope,
  some return in the additional proof which analysis supplies of the
  inferiority of the salmon as food when in the state of a Kelt, and
  the folly of destroying it before it recovers condition.
      The clean salmon of last May presented abundance of fat under
  the skin, and in masses betwixt       the muscles.       Avoiding all accu
   mulations of fat in mass,       I  cut one    piece   of muscle from the
   dorsal region a little in front of the dorsal fin, and another from
   the ventral region directly opposite     ; so that the one should repre
   sent  the " thick," and the other the " thin," of       a slice   of salmon
   Four hundred grains of      each being cut into fine chips about twelve
   hours after the fish was caught, each was separately exhausted by
   ether  ; and the ether was distilled off at a gentle heat.         When the
   residual oil was deprived of a little adhering alcohol and water by
   heating it gently for an hour in an open          vessel, it had     a    bright
   amber colour, and a strong odour not very different            from that of
   cod-liver oil.    The fibrous residuum was dried at 212°        till it  ceased
   to lose   weight.    A portion of the dry residue       was incinerated        in
   order to determine the fixed saline constituents.            The difference
    denoted   the dry nitrogenous nutritive       principles, fibrin, albumen,
    and  extractive matter usually called osmazone.

     The Kelt of last March          was      as  ugly    a specimen   of  the   Salmo
 Salar     as  I  have    ever seen.        It  was 38 inches long, weighed           27

 lacerated in the dorsal fin and tail, and of a uniform, disagreeable,
 mottled-grey colour over the entire skin.                   In its structure other
 wise   it was a true male salmon.              I subjected it to analysis in the

 lysis was made about         forty-eight hours after the fish was caught              ;
 and in the interval it was shut up in a box, so that there could not

    Thus it      appears   —   1. That the nitrogenous solids of a Clean
salmon,      and  its oil or fat, constitute together in round numbers 38
per cent of its flesh ; the remaining 62 per cent being water, with
a  little saline matter      (0-9 per cent.).        2.  That the fat and the nitro
genous constituents are nearly equal to                 one another. 3. That there
is decidedly more fat in the " thin" or abdominal region than                       in

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                        697
the "thick"          or dorsal region, but somewhat lesS of nitrogenous
constituents.          4.  That there is very little difference in constitution
between the dorsal and abdominal regions of a "Foul" fish or
 Kelt. But, 5. That the Kelt is a much more watery fish than the
 clean salmon; and that this is slightly owing to                   a deficiency in
 nitrogenous ingredients, but much                more to an enormous deficiency
 of oil or fat, — which is        reduced    to almost a sixteenth      only of its
 amount in        a clean-run fish.
      I  am not aware of any good           authority    for the prevalent notion
  that    a  Kelt is unwholesome       food.    But it is plain from the foregoing
  analysis,      that    the Parisian gastronome, — who,           before  the late
  stringent     measures      against river-poaching in Scotland during close-
  time, consumed a large proportion of Scottish Kelts,                — must   have
   been indebted for his enjoyment              therein much more to his cook
   than to his fish.        On the other hand, it is easy to see why an Api-
   cius, whose taste has been cultivated on the banks of a Scottish
   salmon-river, should wonder how any one can imagine, that the
   delicate flavour of a fish in good condition is improved by besmear
   ing it with butyraceous sauces, simple or compound.

    different   processes.      The following table gives the names of the

   After treating of the great disparity of opinion regarding                 the
temperature of the sun, the author proceeds to detail how it is              pos
sible, from the known luminous intensity of the sun, to derive                   a
new estimate     of solar temperature.          This calculation is based on a
definite law relating       temperature and luminosity in the case of
solids, viz., the total luminous intensity is a parabolic function of
the temperature, above that temperature where all kinds             of luminous
rays occur.     So that  if T    is  a  certain initial temperature, and    I  its
luminous intensity,     a a    certain increment of temperature, then          we
have the following     relation    : —
                                T  + n(a) =      nsI.
   The temperature      T   is so high     as to include all kinds of luminous
rays, viz., 990° C., and the increment a is 46° C.                This formula
expresses well the results of Draper, and I have used his numbers
as a first approximation.            It   results from the     above   equation,
that at a temperature of 2400° C., the total luminous intensity will
be 900 times that which         it was at 1037° C.       Now, the temperature
of the oxyhydrogen        flame does not exceed 2400° C, and we know
from Fiseau      and Foucalt's         experiments that      sunlight   has 150
times the luminous intensity             of the lime light   ; so that we only
require to calculate at what temperature this intensity is reached
in   order to get the         solar temperature.         This temperature is
16,000° C., in round numbers.             Enormously high temperatures are
not required, therefore, to produce great luminous intensities, and
the temperature of the sun need not, at least, exceed                 the above
number.      Sir William Thomson, in his celebrated article, " On the
                                         " It is almost certain that the sun's
Age of the Sun's Heat," says,
mean temperature is even now as high as 14,000° C.," and this is
the estimate with which the luminous intensity calculation                agrees
well.

                                (Abstract.)
    The author begins this paper by calculating the highest hypo
thetical temperature that could be produced by the chemical
combination of the most energetic elements if all the heat evolved
could be thrown into the product.        This would not exceed 19,500°
C. in the case of silica, and 15,000° C. in the oxides of aluminum and
magnesium, and these are the highest results.           The estimation of
 the temperature of the electric spark is based on the thermal value
 of each spark, together with        the volume      of the same.      The
 methods of observing       these  quantities  are  fully detailed in the
 memoir.      The general result may be stated thus, — the tempera
 ture of the electric spark used in the experiments ranged between
 10,000° C. and 15,000° C.

                             Christison, Bart.
     After summarising the conclusions      at which he had arrived from
  numerous experiments made more than forty years ago, as published
  in his Treatise on Poisons, and in the Transactions of this Society,
  the author alluded to various blanks left at that time in the inquiry
  which had not been yet filled up, and to various criticisms and
  doubts which had been recently expressed        relative to the facts and
   principles formerly announced.

  The general results of the former                 inquiries   are — 1.     That   the
purest waters act the most            powerfully on lead, corroding             it, and
forming a carbonate   of peculiar and uniform composition ; 2. That
all salts impede this action, and many prevent it altogether, some
of them in extremely minute proportion ; and 3. That the proportion
of each salt required to prevent action is nearly in the inverse ratio
of the insolubility of the compound which its acid forms with the
oxide of lead.       The    of certain inorganic and organic ingre
                             effect
dients of water in modifying the preservative power of the salts
was not investigated, but has been since made the subject of nume
rous     observations and inquiries        by others, chiefly, however, of a
desultory nature, some of them much too succinctly described, and
some also  of questionable accuracy.
   The first part of the present paper dealt with the influence of
inorganic substances.   The second part, on the influence of organic
matters,      was reserved    for a subsequent article.
  It     had been denied thatwater acts by reason, and in the ratio,
of its purity; and it had even been alleged that distilled water
itself does not act, if really quite pure. The author, however, had
invariably found the reverse, and could assign no other explanation of
these statements except some error in manipulation.      For example,
a very pure spring water was sent to him from the south of England,
with the assurance that it had been found to be incapable of attach
ing lead.       But, on making trial of       it,   he had found    it   act with an
energy not inferior to that of distilled water.                 Also,   it   had been
stated    that ordinary distilled       water   is   apt to contain        a   trace of
nitric or nitrous acid, from nitrates incidentally                 present in the
water subjected to distillation        ;   and that such water,          if    distilled
after the addition of    little potash to fix the acid thoroughly,
                              a
yields   distillate which has no action on lead.
          a                                         But when the
author prepared distilled water in this way, with great care to
prevent the access of impurities from other sources, the only
result was that the action was              even     greater than that of           the
ordinary distilled water of the laboratory, and so great as he had
never observed before.
   An interesting statement had been made by Dr Kevins, that
some salts appear to allow of certain action going on when they
                                      a
are present largely in water, although their influence, when they

author sometimes obtained the same result, and found the action
such as might prove dangerous. But its limit requires to be de
fined; and there is reason to                suppose        that the proportion required
to permit action will be found              so great as never occurs in the instance
of waters applicable              to household use.
     It   has been also stated,            but in general terms, without                       experi
mental        proof,     that the presence           of carbonate of soda, even in a
hard water, takes away the preventive influence of other salts, and
enables water to dissolve lead.                    There appears to            be some     founda
tion for this statement. But                     here, too,   it is     necessary     to   fix what
is the limit to such influence                   before its importance can be valued.
Moreover, as bicarbonate of soda appeared                             to the author to have
no    such effect,         and this is the usual Iform of the carbonate in
natural waters, the practical importance of the fact is inconsiderable.
   The author called attention to some observers not having under
stood the nature of the corrosive action of water on lead, and having
confounded it with other causes of corrosion.   Thus the true action
has been confounded with the corrosive action                                of potent agents
accidentally coming in contact with the metal in presence of water,
— as, for example,               when    a lead     pipe    has been led through                fresh
mortar which is frequently                  or permanently              kept moist, or when
lumps of fresh mortar have been allowed to fall upon                                  the bottom
of a lead cistern.              Several remarkable examples of rapid corrosion
of this local kind were exhibited.                         The true       or simple action         of
water had been not infrequently                    confounded also with the effects
of galvanic action.                Thus,    if    a lead    pipe      or cistern be soldered
with        pewter-solder, and not with lead, erosion                        takes    place near
the   line of junction of           the solder with the lead,             of which character
istic examples were shown.                  The      presence      of    bars of other metals
crossing lead, or bits of them lying on                         it,   will   also develope        the
same action         ;   and     some    facts seem to point to the same property
being possessed in            a   minor degree        by some stony and earthy sub
stances.        This observation may explain the local erosion sometime
observed in cisterns containing hard water                    ;     since,   if   galvanic action
be excited,         it   will    be increased by saline matter existing                         more
largely in these waters than in soft, or comparatively pure, water.
     Lastly,        some   observers       have     contradicted          former     statements,

because    in certain circumstances, which                led them   to anticipate
no   action, they nevertheless found                lead in water,    but only in
extremely minute and unimportant proportion.                     The test for lead,
the hydrosulphuric        acid, when employed in the way now usually
practised, is so delicate        as  to detect that metal dissolved          in  ten
million parts of    water, and even more.              But facts warrant the    con
clusion that the impregnation               must amount to at least ten times
as much before        water    can act      injuriously     on man, however long
it may   be used.
            2. On the Preservation of Iron Ships.                      By
                     James Young, Esq., of Kellie.
   My attention      was called in        January last year to the rusting of
iron vessels by observing that the bilge water of my yacht (the
"Myanza," 214 tons) was much discoloured by red oxide. Knowing
that bilge water is apt to become acid, and thus to attack iron, the
result was easily accounted             for.    Even when the water does not
become acid, we may expect some action on the iron to take place
when sulphuretted         hydrogen exists, as it frequently does there, in
which case, first a sulphide, then an oxide, and some sulphate, are
formed.      The remedy       seemed to be easy, because the acid can be
neutralised by lime.         This earth would         also prevent the formation
of sulphuretted hydrogen.
   I  put this immediately into practice, adding lime until the bilge
water was alkaline      ;  and samples were taken every fourteen days,
which showed the amount of rust to               be  rapidly diminishing.     After
six months the liquid became perfectly clear, so that the cure                     is
complete.      The yacht is       a composite one, and         the action is there
fore greater than in iron vessels              generally, because of the copper
or cupreous bolts        which      are    used.     These bolts cause     galvanic
currents with the iron,           anil   greatly     assist  in its oxidation    and
solution.
   As   a very   little lime will last          a long period, the plan causes
neither trouble nor expense.               Seeing in the newspapers that the
destruction of the " Maegara
                                       " was attributed to
                                                                the action of bilge
water,   I thought that my experience might be of some value.

  3.   First Report by       the Committee on Boulders appointed
                                by the Society.
   In April       1871,   a paper was read in this Society proposing       a
scheme for the conservation of boulder or erratic blocks in Scotland,
in   so far as they were        remarkable for size or other features of
interest.     The Council      of the Society approved of the      scheme,
appointed     a  committee to carry it out, and agreed to aid in meeting
the expense        of any circulars which might       be necessary for con
ducting the inquiries.
   The objects of      the committee were twofold.       They  were first to
ascertain the districts in Scotland where any remarkable boulders
were situated      ; and, second, to select those which might be deemed
worthy of preservation, with the view of requesting landed proprie
tors and tenants of farms not to destroy them.
   The labours of the committee have           as yet been directed only to
the first of these objects.
   In    order to procure information,       they drew out a set of printed
queries, applicable to boulders apparently above 50 tons in weight,
in order to ascertain the parishes in which they were situated, and
the names of the proprietor and tenant on whose lands they were             ;
and also to learn other features, such as the nature of the rocks
composing the boulders, their form, and the existence of striations
upon them.         Inquiry  was also made whether the boulders had any
traditional     names or popular legend connected with them, or ex
hibited any artificial markings.
   The committee thought that, with           a view to the conservation of
the boulders, the greater the interest which             could be shown to
attach to them, the more chance there would be of inducing pro
prietors    and tenants to preserve        such   as the committee might
select for preservation.
   Besides queries about boulders, there was one query directed to
ascertain the occurrence of kaimes or eskars, i.e., long banks of sand
and gravel, as some persons        imagined that the agents which trans
ported boulders might have had some relation with, or might throw
some    light  on those which were concerned in the formation      of those
deposits.
   Circulars     containing   queries,  a copy   of the minute of Council

704                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
approving of the scheme, and appointing a committee, and an                      ab
stract of the paper         read in the Society in         April 1871, explaining
the scheme,       were  transmitted to the ministers of all rural parishes
in Scotland.
    About 700 circulars were issued.               After the  lapse  of six months
 about 100 answers       were received.
    The committee, on considering                these, were   of opinion, that in
 making their queries applicable only to boulders exceeding 50
 tons in weight, they had probably erred, by excluding many boulders
of interest, and to this circumstance they attributed the small
number of answers sent.
    They therefore      resolved      to issue another circular     containing the
same queries as before,           to    cover boulders exceeding 20 tons in
weight.      This circular     was addressed       to parochial schoolmasters, as
the committee feared that they might be considered troublesome,                    if
they made a second application to ministers of parishes.
    This    second   circular    brought to the committee a large amount
of information, and they desire now to express their cordial thanks
to both classes of reporters for responding so readily.
    When      the  committee was appointed, an expectation                 was  ex
pressed that they should, from time to time, lay before the Society
some account of their            proceedings, and of the progress made by
them.
   In now proceeding         to the performance       of this duty, the committee
will confine themselves          to a   statement of facts communicated, and
avoid at present attempting to draw conclusions from these facts.
    1.   In  order to show the situations of the boulders reported on,
the committee have drawn up a list,* according to counties, giv
ing    the names    of the parishes       where boulders occur, adding shortly
any particulars regarding them, such as size, nature of the rock
composing the         boulder, direction        of the longer axis, striations,
popular names, and legend,             if any.
   They     have also, on a general map           of Scotland, indicated by   a red
cross the exact position         of the most remarkable boulders.
   From      this table and     map, it will be seen that Aberdeenshire        pos
sesses     the largest number of boulders, and also the boulders                  of
greatest     magnitude.
                          *
                              This list is in the Appendix.

                      of Edinburgh,       Session   1871-72.                   705
    Ross   and Cromarty stand next, then Perth, Argyll, Inverness,
Kirkcudbright,      and   Forfar.
    2.  In  regard to size, the largest boulder reported is one of granite,
in the parish of Pitlochry, called " Clach Mhor" (big               stone), being
about eight yards square, and estimated about 800 tons.
    There are two boulders between 500 and 600 tons weight, one in
Ross, the other in The Lewis.
    There are three boulders between             200 and 500 tons, seven        be
tween 100 and 200 tons, twenty between 50 and 100 tons.
    3.  With regard     to the nature    of the rocks composing the boulders,
the largest reported are of granite, though there is one known to
the convener of the committee, still larger, of conglomerate, in
 Doune parish.         The   most     numerous are composed          of compact
greenstone     ;  but these      are   generally of small size.         The next
 most numerous class are of grey granite.              There are also many of
 gneiss, grey-wacke, and conglomerate.
    4. The boulders reported generally differ in regard to the nature of
 the rocks composing them, from that of the rocks of the district in
 which they are situated       ;  and, in many     of the  reports,   reference   is
 made to the district from which the boulder is supposed to have come.
    Thus, in those parts of Perthshire,          Forfarshire,  and   Kincardine
 shire where the old red sandstone formation                 prevails, and over
 which multitudes of granite, gneiss, and conglomerate boulders are
 lying,  most    of the reporters    have no hesitation in pointing out that
 the parent rock is in the Grampian               range, lying to the north or
 west.    So also in Wigtonshire,       where the greywacke formation pre
 vails, and on which many boulders of grey granite are lying, the
 general opinion is that they came from the granite hills of                 Kirk
 cudbrightshire.
    But where a boulder happens to be of a species of rock the same
 as that of the rocks of the neighbourhood, it is more difficult to
 recognise   it as  a true erratic.    Hence, in the Lewis, where there are
 huge single blocks of gneiss, which is also the prevailing rock of
 the country, the reporters say that they cannot tell whether these
 blocks are erratics or not.
    5.  The boulders mentioned in the reports are of various shapes.
 Some approach a cube, well rounded of course on the corners and
 sides.    That is the shape mostly possessed by granite boulders.

706                  Proceedings      of the Royal Society
Others again are of an oblong shape, and this is particularly the                 case
with whinstone and greywacke boulders.                     The difference in       this
respect    is probably mainly due to a difference in the             natural struc
ture of the parent rocks.
   A point of      some   importance occurs in regard to oblong-shaped
boulders.
   The direction of their longer axis, in the great majority                 of cases,
is stated     to coincide with the direction in which they have come
from the parent rock, when the situation of that rock has been
ascertained.        Thus, in Auchterarder         parish, there is a boulder 10
feet long by 6 broad, the longer axis          of which points north-west.          In
Auchtergaven         parish there is a granite boulder 10 feet long by 8
broad,    the longer axis of which points due north.                  In Menmuir
parish, Forfarshire,       there are two large granite boulders, the one
14 by 9, and the other 13 by 9, the longer axis                   of which points
north-west.        In  each  of  these  cases    the reporters seem satisfied of
the situation of the parent rock, and           in each case the longer axis of
the boulder points towards it.
   It appears, also, that where there are natural striations or rut* on
the boulders, these        almost always run in a direction parallel with
the longer axis      ; and that when there are striae crossing these, the
number of such oblique striae are comparatively few.
   6.  Notice in the reports is taken of the remarkable positions occu
pied by some boulders.
   Thus, the Ardentinny report refers to a large boulder called
" Clachan Udalain," or the nicely balanced stone,* so-called, as the
            states, because
                               " it stands on the very             of a
reporter                                                     edge         precipice,
and must have been gently deposited               there."     In the same parish
there is another boulder, called
                                         " The Giant's Putting       Stone.     It  is
pear shaped,       and rests on its small end.            It looks," says the re
          "  as if a  push would roll it over."
porter,
   In Menmuir parish (Forfarshire),            two boulders are reported, each
from 30 to 40 tons in weight, and perohed on or near the top of a
hill, having come there, as the reporter thinks, from a parent rock
15 miles distant, with several valleys intervening.
   Cases of the same       kind   are reported from islands.
   On Iona, near the top of the highest             hill in the island, which       is
        *  Another translator represents this word to mean   "of the nciocl. "

                    of Edinburgh,      Session 1871-72.                     707
about 250 feet above the sea, there is         a great boulder of granite.
There is no granite in the island. The          nearest   place where that
rock occurs is in the Ross of Mull, with an     arm  of the  sea intervening.
    In   the Island of Eday,       in Orkney,   there is a conglomerate
                        "
boulder, called the Giant's Stone," about 8 tons in weight, near the
top of a hill — the only one in the island — about 300 feet high.
There is no conglomerate rock in Eday. But conglomerate rock
occurs in the Island of Stronsay, situated to the south-east, a few
 miles distant.
    7. The report from the parish        of Benholm (Forfarshire),      by the
 Rev. Mr Myres, gives information and suggestions to the committee
 of considerable interest. On the sea coast of that parish, two sets
 of boulders   are described.    One set are supposed to have come from
 the Grampian range many miles to the north-west, and consist of
 granite and gneiss rocks.        But another   set, also consisting     of pri
 mitive    rocks, are believed to be derived from          a different source
 altogether, viz., from the great beds of conglomerate rock, which
 forms a band      crossing the whole of Scotland from Stonehaven
 and Bervie, in    a  south-west direction, to Dumbarton and Rothesay.
 Some     of the rounded    masses in the conglomerate are stated         to be
 several feet in diameter, and      a few present appearances     of striation  ;
 a   fact which,  if established, would     seem  to prove that, at a very
 early period indeed, ice action had existed, and had formed boulders
 just as it did at a later period.
     This report from Benholm parish        was read lately at a meeting of
  the Geological Society    of Edinburgh, and   was illustrated by drawings
  and specimens which afforded strong evidence          of the correctness of
  these views.
     8. With regard to kaims or long embankments of gravel or              sand,
  there are twenty-three     parishes reported to the committee as con
  taining them.
     They   appear to be most numerous in Aberdeenshire, Forfarshire,
  and in the east    of Perthshire.     In Kemnay parish there is a kaim
  said to be  2J miles long, running east and west. In Airlie parish
  there is a  kaim 2 miles long, also running east and west.           In Fet-
  tercairn parish, Kincardineshire,       and also in Tarbet parish, Ross-
  shire, there are several kaims parallel to, and not far distant from,
  one another.

708               Proceedings      of the Royal Society
   In two   cases the   reporters,   wbo   seem to have       visited Switzer
land, whilst mentioning kaims in their parishes, express             an opinion
that they are evidently lateral and terminal moraines.
   In   several cases, oddly enough, these kaims exist at much the
same level above the sea, viz., between          700    and 800     feet, which
happens    also to be the height of similar deposits in Berwickshire
and Mid-Lothian.
   The committee wish it        to be understood, that         in the present
report,   they confine themselves simply            to   a statement      of the
information    received.     They do not think it would              be  wise as
yet to attempt to draw theoretical            conclusions.      Almost     every
day they     are  receiving    more    answers     to their    circulars;     and
they think that the wider the basis for considering the important
geological questions connected       with the transport of boulders and
the formation of kaims, there will       be  the more probability of reach
ing the truth.
   One object which     the committee have in view in explaiuing               the
nature of the information       communicated to them, is to show              and
to acknowledge the deep debt         of gratitude which this         society bes
under to the gentlemen who have responded                 to the circulars of
the committee.
   But whilst the information supplied is undoubtedly valuable, the
committee cannot but feel the truth of what many of the reporters
themselves modestly and properly            state,   that they are so little
acquainted with geology or mineralogy, that they may not hive
correctly understood the queries, or they may not have made their
observations in the way necessary to answer the queries.              Moreover,
the committee    itself may not in all      cases have     rightly   understood
the answers given.
   Having regard to       these    considerations,     the committee        would
very much      desire   that   the    boulders reported       should      be ei-
amined     by   experienced     geologists,    who     should    at   the    same
time make a survey of the district,            in order to see whether            it
presents   any special features bearing on the nature of the              agency
by which the boulders were transported.             The information        in   the
reports received   by the committee would greatly facilitate such in
inspection, as they indicate not only the parish and the farm               where

the boulder is situated, but generally              record other features       of
interest.
     The committee entertain        a hope,   that were    this wish on their
part    made known, some geologists, who may be either resident                 in
Scotland      or who may purpose to visit Scotland during             the course
of the ensueing summer or autumn, might offer their services in
the way, and for the purpose now suggested. In that case, the
committee would willingly lend the reports which they have received,
on condition       that the results of the inspection were made known
 to the committee.
     The committee will place in the library of this Society, the list
 of boulders before referred to, showing the parishes in each county
 in which the boulders         and kaims are situated, so that any person
 may see where these parishes are, and be able to judge whether it
 would be convenient for him to visit these.
     Were this list published, and generally circulated, good would
 result in another way. As it would show all the parishes from
  which reports of remarkable boulders and kaims had come, some
 persons might be able to discover parishes from which               reports had
  been   omitted to be sent, and         if these   were  pointed out to the
 committee, they would make the requisite inquiry.
     II.   The committee     proceed next to notice points     of archozological
  interest connected with boulders.
     1.  The committee        were   surprised with     the large number of
  individual boulders possessing         names   by which they were known
  in the district.
     The names may        be classified under several     heads: — First, there
  are names      having reference to the agency by which           the boulders
  were supposed      to have come into the district.         Second,    there are
  names     indicative of the use to which boulders were put.              TJn'rd,
  there are names       making    the   boulders commemorative of certain
  events.
     Many of the boulders,       besides having a name, have also a legend,
  which explains       and illustrates the name.
     The Giant's Stone, Fingal's Putting Stone, the             Witches'    Stone,
   the   Carlin    Stone,   Heathens,     Hell    Stones,  the    Deil's    Stone,
  the   Deil's    Putting   Stone,   the Deil's   Mither's Stone, — these      are
  among the names,         almost all in the Gaelic language, which ap-

710                      Proceedings of           the   Royal Society
parently were given to account for the way in which particular
boulders came into the district. *
     To show that this             was the origin and object                of the     names, a few
of the legends,           as stated       in the reports, may be given.                     They in
dicate, no doubt, a very deplorable state of ignorance and credulity                                       ;
but they indicate              also that in many cases our forefathers                               had
satisfied themselves that the boulders had been transported into                                      the
district.Their perplexity was how to account for their transport.
Not knowing anything of glaciers or icebergs, they had to resort to
supernatural agency for an explanation.                               A few examples         may be
given.
     Reference has already been made to a large conglomerate boulder
near    the top of a hill, in the Island of Eday, one of the Orkneys.
It   goes under the name                 of "               The legend
                                                CHant's Stone."                              for it    is,
that   it   was flung by       a    giant from the Island of Stronsay.                       Now, as
already stated,           there     is   no conglomerate              rock which could           have
supplied the boulder in Eday Island, but there                              is    in Stromsa.
     So also      in the Island of Sanday,                 one   of the Orkneys,           there     is   a
granite or gneiss boulder                ;   the legend about which is, that                    it   was
thrown from the Shetland                      Islands      by    a   giantess, who had             been
jilted by     a    Westray man.              She intended to throw                it   into Westray,
but she made            a   bad shot, and         it    fell into   Island of
                                                                       the                   Sanday.
There    is      no rock which could have              produced the boulder in               Sanday,
but there        is   abundance of       it   in the Shetlands.
   About 1£ miles west of St Andrew's in Fife, there   a large con                   is
glomerate boulder, and the legend about       that when the "Fourit   is,
knockit
                        " in that town
            steeple                             was being built,            a   giant who lived        at
Drumcarro             Crags,   a   hill about      5    miles to the north-west                  of    St
Andrews, was indignant, and resolved to demolish the edifice.                                         He,
therefore, got the largest stone he could find, and borrowing                                         his
mother's apron, be made                  a   sling of   it,   and threw         it   at St Andrew-:.
But    the stone being too heavy, the apron broke, and the stone did
not quite reach its destination,                   and there          it    has    lain ever     since.
There       is   no conglomerate rock where the boulder lies, but there                                   is
at or near Drumcarro                Crags.

      The Witches'          Stone,    which is on the estate of Pitferran,                      near
Dunfermline,                   : A witch who lived among the hills
                      has this legend
to the west, wishing to confer a favour on the Pitferran family, re
solved to give them a cheese-press, the heaviest she could find. She
selected a large block of basalt of the proper shape, and carried it in
her apron, which, however, broke under the load before she reached
the family residence            ;    and there it has lain ever since.                 There is no
rock of that kind near Dunfermline,                             but there is to the west
ward.
      In   the parish of Carnwath there are one or two spots where there
are or have been groups or collections of whinstone boulders, be
tween the river Clyde and a                hill of whinstone , known by the                    name
of the Yelpin Craigs.                  The distance between                the river and this
hill is three or four miles.               These heaps of boulders have from time
immemorial gone by the name of Eelhtanes,                             insomuch that places
near them are called Eelhtanes Loan, Eelhtanes                                 Gate,    &c.       The
legend       is,   that Michael Scott and           a   great band of witches, wishing
to dam back the Clyde, gathered stones at the Yelpin Craigs, and
were       bringing       them towards the Clyde, when one of the young
                                              "
witches, groaning beneath her load, cried out, Oh Lord, but                                  I    am
tired."       As    soon as she uttered the sacred                   name, the spell broke,
the stones fell down, and have remained there ever since.*
   There are many legends founded on the agency of the devil, and
on his hatred         of churches and clergy.                   Thus near the old church
of Invergowrie,             now in ruins, there            is
                                                            a    large whinstone boulder,
called the Paddock Stone.                 The legend about            it    is,   that the devil,
going about in Fife, descried the church shortly after                             it   was begun
to be built, and wishing to stop the work, threw                           a   large stone at      it
across the     Frith of Tay.           There   is   no whinstone rock at or near              Inver
gowrie, but there              is    abundance        of   it    immediately           opposite in
Fife.
   In the parish of Kemnay (Aberdeenshire), there                                 isa   boulder of
grey granite, called the Devil's Stone, estimated to weigh about
250 tons, which lies not far from the old                         kirk.     There      is   no rock
of that nature in Kemnay parish, but there                          is    at Bennachie,       a   hill
about seven or eight miles to the westward.                           The legend explain-

712                   Proceedings           of the Royal Society
ing how this boulder came from Bennachie forms the subject                      of  a
ballad * a few verses of which may be given.
                  " Tt was the feast o' Sanct Barnabas,

    These legends, in explanation of the transport of Scotch boulders,
are of the same nature as the legend which professes to explain how
the Blue Stones of Stonehenge          came to Salisbury      Plain in England.
Jeffrey of Monmouth, who          was the first author to write a descrip
tion of Stonehenge, says that certain of the stones were brought
by Merlin and a band of giants from Ireland. Mr Fergusson,
in his book on Ancient Stone Monuments, recently published,
says that some geological friends of his have told him, that
these blue stones of Stonehenge are a species of trap, which is not
known in England,          but is well known in Ireland           ;  and  therefore
 Mr Fergusson      supposes that they probably were brought from                 Ire
 land in ships.    It  seems quite as      likely that these blue stones were
 boulders, and were brought from Ireland by natural agency, and
 deposited on Salisbury Plain in that way.             There are strong proofs
 to show that there was an agency            of some    kind which swept over
 Ireland from the westward,          and brought boulders across            what is
 now the Irish Channel to the south-west districts of England.
    In these legends     we see the efforts     of the    people    in those early
 times to account, in the best way they could, for the transport of
 boulders into their districts.       It  is evident that they had investi
 gated   the subject, and had made considerable approaches                    to the
 truth.    Finding that many of these great blocks differed in com
 position from all the rocks of the district             where    the blocks lay,
 and    inferring that their rounded          shapes    were   probably      due    to
 friction, they inferred that they must have             come    into the district
 from some distant quarter;          and this inference was confirmed by
 discovering     that in certain other districts there was rock of the
 same description as the blocks.         But how blocks exceeding          100 tons
 weight could have been brought many miles, and over a tract of
 country uneven        and   broken in its      surface,    their    knowledge      of
 nature's laws did not enable         them to explain.         The only agency
 which they could think of was superhuman and supernatural                     ;  and
 hence    the invention      of such legends      as  assumed        the agency of
  Merlin, giants, Michael Scott, witches,         and the devil.

     2.   The   second    class      of   names     by which particular boulders                    are
known, have            reference to the            uses    to    which    these        stones were
put.
     In   remote periods        in the history of Scotland, when there                      were no
maps, roads, or even             names of parishes, it was important                        to have
some      other means of indicating                  spots       or districts where people
required to congregate for special purposes.
     One of the boulders reported              to the Committee (in the Island of
                                   " Clachan Treudach" or the Ga
Harris), still goes by the name of
thering Stone.
     What    were the special purposes                    for which our early forefathers
gathered        together    is    of      course    not easily discovered.                  But the
ancient names of the boulders seem to throw light on the sub
ject                        " Clach-sleuchdaidh," or Stones of Wor
       (1.) Such names as
ship (in the parish of Kirkmichael) ;
                                       " Clach an t-Tobairt," or Stone
of Sacrifice     ;
                       " Clach na Greine," Stone of the Sun                        ;
                                                                                        "   Clach    na
h'Annait." Stone of Victory, (a Scandinavian deity);                                   and "Clach
mhbr a Che," Great Stone of Che, (another deity), seem very plainly
to indicate          that these boulders were used as trysting-places                                for
worship ; and they were all the more suitable                            if they       were looked
upon with superstitious awe, on account of their supposed                                    connec
tion with spiritual          agency.          On two of the boulders reported                         to
the Committee, there are artificial circular markings, other examples
of which        are    very numerous               throughout         Scotland;        and though
uiuhaeologists         are not yet agreed as to the meaning of these marks,
one theory       is,   that they were symbols of                 a   religious character.             It
is   well known that these great stones were in some way or other,
hindrances to the reception and diffusion of Christianity in most
of the countries of Western Europe for between the years 500 and
                                                      ;
800 there are numbers of decrees and edicts requiring these stones
to be destroyed,         as being objects of superstition.                   There are              some
archaeologists who go so far as to maintain that the word
                                                          " Kirk''
is                                     "
   actually synonymous with the word Circle," meaning the circle
of stones where Celtic worship was performed.
  (2.) Another use               to    which       these        boulders were          applied       vu
Sepulture. There           is   in    Berwickshire,        a    boulder known by the                name
of the'' Pech or Pict's Stone," round which human bones in very
large quantities were found a few years ago and similar discoveries
                                                                  ;

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                           715
have      been   made    at boulders      in  many other districts, especially
where they formed circles.
     If  these   great boulders were used as places             of worship, it   was
natural that they should also            be used    for sepulture, on account ot
the supposed sanctity of the              place.   Indeed, the fact of a place
having      been used for sepulture, creates         of itself a presumption that
it   was used also for worship.
     (3.) Another important purpose for which the boulders were
used, was for the trial of offenders and the issuing of judicial sen
tences.      Thus, in Little Dnnkeld parish, there is a large boulder
called " Clach a mhoid,"* or Stone of the place of Justice, where
the baron of the district          could try offenders, with right to hang or
 drown those convicted.            In Ayrshire    there is another large boulder
 called the Stone      of Judgment, for the barony of Killochan.             Several
 large rocking stones have been reported.                 In ancient times,    when
 very rude tests of guilt or innocence were employed, the rocking
 stone was used in the        trial of  persons   accused of crimes.
               " It moves obsequious    to the gentlest touch,
                 Of him whose breast is pure.      But to the traitor,
                 Though   even  a giant's prowess nerved him,
                 It stands as fixed as Snowdon."
     (4.) There are boulders which are known to have been used as
 trysling places for military gatherings; a large boulder on Cul-
 loden Moor is one example.              It  was on a whinstone boulder called
  The Bore Stone, that Robert Bruce planted               his standard before the
 Battle     of Bannockburn.          A    sandstone boulder on the Borough
 Muir, near Edinburgh,            was the gathering point for the army col
 lected by James IV. before the Battle of Flodden.                     Both of these
 stones are in existence.           The Bannockburn stone is protected by
  an iron grating.        The other stone is also preserved, being fixed on
  a  wall near Morningside         parish church, having on it a brass plate,
  bearing an inscription, given by the late Sir John Forbes.
     (5.) Some boulders are said to have been used as trysting places
  for the contracting of engagements, such as matrimonial contracts,
  and others less       important.      There is a boulder in the parish of
  Coldstream (Berwickshire),          called the Grey Stone from its colour,
  at  which within the last hundred years marriages took place.                  The
                          * New Stat. Acc. vol. x.

 716                Proceedings      of the Royal Society
bride and bridegroom stood on tiptoe on each side of the stone                     and
joined    hands over the top, whilst            the friends of each party sur
rounded the stone to witness the engagement.                     The   Stone  of Odin,
in the Orkneys, at which marriages were celebrated, was held in
peculiar     veneration    ;  for in   one      case     where a man        was    pro
secuted    for deserting his wife, it was stated to be an aggravation
of his offence, that they had been married at the Stone of Odin.
    3.  A third class of names given          to boulders had relation to them
as commemorative        of important   events.
    Thus there     is in Badenoch the
                                             " Vlach an Charra," or Stone            of
Vengeance, so called because             a profligate        and tyrannical     feudal
baron was     killed by his own people near it.*
   There is in Lewis the " Clach D'hois," or Stone of D'hois,                          a
boulder of gneiss, weighing          about     120 tons.        It is called after     a
person    named     D'hois, who slew a giant near the boulder, and who
also himself      died immediately after, from the wounds received                   in
 the conflict.f
    4. Some boulders were used to mark the boundaries of estates,
 parishes, and counties, and          are    still in many        parts  of Scotland
 recognised as affording evidence on that subject.
    In  Ross-shire, the boundary between               the districts of Urray      and
 Contin is marked by the         boulder called " Clachloundron."
    A great boulder is said to indicate the spot where the three
 counties of Dumfries, Ayr, and Lanark meet.
    The line of boundary between England and Scotland was in the
 eastern borders originally indicated by boulders, several of which
 still remain.
    5. Some     of the boulders      have curious popular predictions             con
 nected with them.
    Thus, near Invergowrie,        on the north side          of the Frith of     Tay,
 there were      in the     days  of Thomas          the     Rhymer     two boulders
 entirely surrounded by the water, of which the seer sang —
                     " When Gows of Gowrie come to land
                       The day of judgment's near at hand."
    These two boulders, called the Gows (probably                     because  always
 frequented by sea-gulls), are now no longer surrounded by                       water.

But it      is not they which         have come       to land, the land has come                   to

   In the parish of Crieff              a boulder of whinstone               is reported, with
a vein of white quartz through and partially                              round        it,   in con
sequence of which                the stone     has    from time           immemorial            been
known        as the Belted Stane.             The prediction about               it    is,   that the
white belt will gradually increase                   in length       till   it   envelopes        the
stone   ;   and that whenever the two ends meet,                    a    great battle will         be
fought, on which occasion               a   king will     be seen mounting his horse
at the stone,       —

                        The nobles bluid shall run like   stream.

Geologists, however, are of opinion that there                       is     not much chance
of the quartz vein extending.
  Perhaps some persons                 may think that the time of the Royal
Society should not be taken up by any allusion                               to these         absurd
popular legends.              There are, however, good reasons                    for referring
to them.           In   the first place, they are evidence of the extraordinary
ignorance and superstition               which prevailed in former times in our
own     land, and         even at no very distant date.              In the          second place,
the archaeological and even historical associations with which many
of the boulders are invested, may induce many proprietors to take
an interest in them and                save them from destruction,                   if   the com
mittee think them worthy of preservation.
  There       is   even     yet among our fellow-countrymen                      a   considerable
amount of interest felt in these boulders, and particularly such as
have traditionary names and legends                  ;   and   it   is   to this feeling that
several are indebted for their preservation.                         Professor          Geikie     at
the last meeting of the British Association told this anecdote of
the Ayrshire boulder, known as the Killochan Stone of Judgment.
An enterprizing tenant, a stranger to the district, finding this
stone    much in his way, was preparing to blow                             it   up with gun
powder.        His intention becoming known,               some     of the old residenters
went to the laird's factor and asked whether he knew what was
intended.          On his stating that he did not, he was entreated                           to pre
vent the stone from being destroyed.                       The proprietor               was com
municated with, and the new tenant was interdicted from meddling

    It   is a boulder of blue whinstone, on which stands the market
cross of Inverness.     For some reason or other, it is preserved as
the Palladium of the town, ever since the battle of Harlaw in the
year 1411.   It is called " Cinch na cudden," or " Stone of the tubs,"
from the circumstance that the people carrying water from the
river used long ago to rest their tubs on it. It was till lately in
the middle of the street           ;   but having ceased to be of               use,   when
water was brought into the town by pipes, it was removed to the
side of the street opposite to the town hall, with the old cross of

    In   the parish of Rattray, there is a remarkable boulder of mica
ceous schist, weighing about 25 tons,            of which        some         account       was
given a short time ago in this Society.                    It   bears     a number of
artificial markings of a very ancient date.                The tenant of the farm
on which it is situated proposed            to blow it up.          Some        of the in
habitants having heard of this, went to the minister of the parish,
and begged him to take steps to save the old stone of Glenballoch.
The proprietor being on the Continent,                 the rev. gentleman ap
plied to the factor, and through            his good   offices saved            the stone.
This gentleman being still under anxiety               about     it,    lately requested
this committee to communicate with the proprietor, Colonel                                 Clark
Rattray, with the view of obtaining from him                    a   promise that the
stone should be preserved.              Colonel Clark Rattray was accordingly
written to by the convener of the committee, and he at once ac-
ceeded to the request.
    There    is    on the shore at Prestonpans, on         the south side of the
 Firth of Forth,   large basaltic boulder, which has long been

 ago by     rail    to Tranent     Station, and walked towards the shore in
 search of    it.     Between the railway station and Prestonpans he met

pointed it out at once. Three or four other persons in succession,
two of them        women,      had to be asked the same question before the
spot    was    reached.       Every       one knew

evident that every inhabitant of Prestonpans, not only knew of the
boulder, but took         a   personal interest in               it,   and would sternly resist
any attempt to destroy it.
  It    is   satisfactory to find this popular feeling              still prevailing to
some extent.        But the feeling            is   not of itself sufficient to prevent
the wholesale destruction which                    isgoing on in many parts of Scot
land.        Thus, the minister of Bendochy reports to the committee,
that "   on the rising ground behind his manse, there was a circle                                           of

  There was formerly               a   rocking stone in Aberdeenshire, estimated
at about 50 tons weight            ;    but   it   has now been converted into field
dykes.
  Numberless cases of the same kind can be specified.

main of these megalithic relics               ;     and     it   is    especially gratifying to
the    committee to be able to state,                        that the movement towards
this object, made by this Society, has met with general approval.

influential      geologists to carry out                a   similar       scheme       for England
and Ireland.
  In the last number of the " Geological Magazine," there                                    is  a   luuda-

North    Uist. — On a small island called Caneum, north of Loch-
     maddy Bay,        there are two boulders        of Laureutian gneiss,
     which, though 100 feet apart, are evidently the two fragments
     of one block. The rocks in situ are also gneiss           ;  but there is
     no hill or cliff near, from which the block could           have fallen or
     come.      One boulder weighs about 15, the other about 50 tons.
     They    are both on the sea-beach,        with a ridge or isthmus of
     rock between them.          The boulders    have   each   a side — in the
     one concave, and      in the other convex — which face one another,
     and correspond exactly in shape and size.            The    edges of  these
     two sides (viz., the convex and concave) are sharp, whereas
     the other sides in both boulders are rounded, suggesting that
     the original     block had undergone much weathering or other
     wearing action before         being fractured.      The larger boulder
      rests   fantastically    and    insecurely   on  two smaller       blocks.
      Reporter thinks the boulder brought by ice, and that it                ftll
      from a height, and was split by the fall.
         In Long Island       the hills even to the summits are covered

      sharp, whereas     the native rock, whether low down or high up,
      is glaciated, grooved, and striated to      a very remarkable degree.
      The   best places   to see   these  marks are where drift, covering
      them, has been recently removed.           They   are obliterated in the
      rocks, which have been much weathered.                (Reporter   —Alex.

                 Report by  Mr Campbell of Islay.
The well-known author of " Frost and Fire," who has studied the
    subject of the transport of boulders, not only in Scotland, but
      in many foreign lands on both sides of the Atlantic, has sent
      to the Committee a report, from which                  the following extracts
      are made       :—
           "   I   find in Scotland,      upon       ridges which    separate     rivers,
      marks of glaciation          upon a large scale.         These enable me to
      say, with tolerable certainty, that the ice which grooved rocks
      in the Outer Hebrides, at low levels, near sounds, moved from
      the ocean in the direction which tides now follow in the straits
      beside which the striae are found.
           "The conclusion         at which      I   have arrived, by the examina
      tion of all these phenomena, boulders included,                       is,   that   a
      system        of glaciations prevailed in Scotland, which             can be ex

736              Proceedings      of the Royal Society
    plained by the system         now existing in Greenland.              There,    a
    vast system     of Continental      ice, as great in area as         all India,
    radiates seawards, and launches icebergs,              which      move about
     in tides and currents.       This system certainly existed in Scot
     land previous to the smaller system.
        " Following any glen in Scotland, say Glenfyne, the smaller
     system of glaciation follows the course of the river (as in
     Switzerland), and the course of the tides in the sea loch (as
    glaciers do in Greenland) ; and, furthermore, often overruns
     low watersheds, and runs out to sea in some direct line.                   The
    striae which mark the run         of ice from the head      of Glenfyne to
    Lochgilphead, run over a col and down Loch Killisport. They
    run past Tarbert, down both sides of Ceantyre and Arran, and
    out to sea.     At Ormsary, by the       roadside, and on the sea-beach,
    is a train of large boulders to which the usual legends are
    attached.      One was thrown from Knapdale at a giant who was
    eating a cow on the other side of the loch.                    One of these
    boulders close to Ormsary House, at a small roadside                  cottage,
    is the biggest      I  have seen      in Scotland.       I  did not try to
    ascertain whence it came.          I   think it   was pushed a short dis
    tance   only.     But the    striae and     trains of blocks show that it
    moved from       N.E.  to S.W. along the general line of hollows in
    the Western Highlands.
        " On the outer islands in Scotland              are marks equivalent
    to those   so conspicuous on shore.             In the Long Island, from
    Barra Head to the Butt of Lewis, the whole country glaciated,
    and the boulders everywhere perched              upon   the   hills.   Where
    surface newly exposed,        the striations and smooth polishing so
    perfect and fresh, that marks can be copied as brasses are copied
    in churches by antiquaries.           I  showed    to you samples        taken
    last   year in Barra and         Uist.     I  have   a large series      taken
    wherever     I  have wandered.          These enable       me to say, with
    tolerable certainty, that the ice which grooved rocks in Outer
    Hebrides at low levels, near sounds, moved from the ocean in
    the   direction    which   tides now follow         in the straits,     beside
    which the striae are found.        For example, the grooves upon the
    flat at Iochdar, at the       north end of South Uist, aim directly
    at the   Cuchullin Hills in Skye.          At the Mull of Ceantyre,        at a

                   of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72.                                737
    great height above the         bea,  grooves aim at Bhinns of Islay
    parallel to the run of the tides.          And    so  it  is at a great many
    other places all round the coast."
       In  a letter from the same gentleman to                Mr Carmichael, of
    South Uist, dated 29th March             1872, the following           passages
    occur   : —
        " Glacial    striae occur upon fixed rocks           in Tiree, Minglay,
    Barra, South and North Uist.             They correspond with           a direc
    tion from the N.W., or thereabouts.
        " The   striae abound,     and   are especially        fresh in the low
    levels, and opposite to hollows in hills, which would be under
    water, and traversed by tides,        if  those levels were now to sink
    a few     hundred feet.      The hills,     so far as      I  have   examined
    them, are ice-worn to the very top.               Transported blocks are
    scattered     all   over these   islands.      In    some      places   regular
    boulder-clay is left in patches.         Under the clay, the rocks are
    smooth as polished marble.            The boulders,         so far as    I  have
    been able to ascertain, are of the same rock as the rock of the
    islands named.         Boulders in Tiree, for example, may have
    come from      Uist or Barra.     They     are perched       upon the highest
    hill-top in Tiree.
        " I was unable to find
                                    any sample of the rocks of Skye in
    Uisi or in Tiree."

              1.   On the Chemical              Efficiency of Sunlight.
                               By James Dewar, Esq.
   Of all the           processes    proposed    to measure         varying       luminous in
tensities          by means      of chemical          effects,    not     one    has yet been
expressed in strictly dynamical                  measure.          This is owing to        the
very small amount of energy to be measured                                necessitating very
peculiar processes for its recognition.                   The chemical actions           gene
rally induced by light are of the               "Trigger"         or "Relay" description        ;
that    is,    bear     no necessary       relation     to the power evolved by the
transformation.            There     is        of light continuously
                                          one natural action
at work of    very different kind in the decomposition of carbonic
                    a
acid by plants, necessitating  large absorption of energy, and thus
                                           a
enabling           us   to ascertain      the proportion           of the radiant       power
retained, through the chemical syntheses effected.
   So far as        I     am   aware,      the following passage                extracted from
Helmholtz's Lectures "On                   the Conservation        of Energy," delivered

752                     Proceedings of     the    Royal Society
at the Royal        Institution in    1864, and published          in the " Medical
Times and Gazette," contains the first estimate of the chemical effi
                      " Now, we            have seen already, that by the         life
ciency of sunlight.
of plants great stores of energy           are collected     in the form of com
bustible matter, and that they are               collected under the influence of
solar light.        I   have shown you in the last lecture that some            parts
of     solar light — the so called chemical             rays, the blue and the
violet which        produce chemical        action — are completely          absorbed
and     taken away by the green leaves of plants             ;   and we must sup
pose that these chemical          rays afford that amount of energy which
is necessary     to decompose        again the carbonic acid and water into
its elements, to separate the oxygen, to give it back to the atmo
sphere, and to collect the carbon and hydrogen of the water and
carbouic acid in the body of the plant itself.             It    is not yet possible
to show that there exists an accurate equivalent proportion between
the     power or energy of the solar rays which are absorbed                  by the
green     leaves of plants, and the energy which is stored                 up in the
form of chemical force in the interior of the plants.                     'We are not
yet able to make so accurate           a   measurement of both these stores
of energy, as to be able to show that there is an equivalent pro
portion.      We    can only show that the amount          of energy which the
rays of    the sun bring to the rank is completely sufficient to produce
such     an   effect as this chemical       effect   going on in the plant.         I
will give you       some    figures in refereuce to this.          It   is found in a
piece of cultivated land producing               corn or trees, one may reckon
per year and per square foot of land 0 03(j lb. of carbon to be pro
duced by vegetation.          This   is the amount      of carbon, which during
one year, on the surface of a square foot in our latitude, can be
produced under the influence of solar rays.                 This quantity, when
used     as fuel and burnt to produce             carbonic acid, gives so much
heat    that 291 lbs. of water could be heated            1° C.         Now we know
the whole quantity of solar light which comes down to one square
foot of terrestrial surface during one second, or one minute, or oue
year.     The whole amount which           comes     down during a year to one
square foot is sufficient to raise the temperature               of 430,000 lbs. of
water    1° C.      The amount of heat which           can be produced by fuel
growing upon one square foot during one year                 is,   as you see from
these    figures,   a   very small fraction of the whole amount of solar

                     of Edinburgh,          Session 1871-72.                        753
heat which can       be    produced by the solar rays.                It is only the
1477th     part of the whole energy of solar light.                  It is impossible
to determine the quantity of solar heat so accurately that we could
detect the loss of so small a fraction as is absorbed by plants and
converted     into other forms of energy.                Therefore, at present, we
can only show that the amount of solar heat is sufficient to pro
duce the effects of vegetable life, but we cannot yet prove that this
is a complete equivalent ratio."             This estimate     is,   strictly speaking,
the mean agricultural efficiency of          a   given area of land, cultivated as
forest, and considering that active growth only takes place during five
months in the year, we may safely adopt TTUtn                  °f tne total energy
of sunlight as fair value of the conserved power, on given area
                 a                                                       a
of the earth's surface in this latitude during the course of the
summer.    As chlorophyll in one or other of its forms   the sub           is
stance through           which      light   becomes      absorbed,      and     chemical
decomposition ensues,          it   would be interesting to acquire some idea
of the storage of power, effected             by   a   given area of leaf surface
during     the course     of   a   day, and to compare this with the total
available energy.         Here we are dealing with strictly measurable
quantities, provided we could determine the equation of chemical
transformation.
  Boussingault's        recent observations on the amount of carbonic acid
decomposed      by   a   given      area of green      leaf seem to me to afford
interesting    data for    a   new    determination of the efficiency of sun
light.     In his experiments          made between       the months of January
and      October under the most favourable circumstances in atmo
spheres rich in CO2 one square decimetre of leaf has decomposed in
one hour, as   mean 5'28 cc of CO,, and in darkness evolves in the

of green surface will decompose   in twelve hours of the day, 6336
cc of CO.,, and produce in twelve hours of the night 396 cc of CO,.
   This quantity of carbonic acid decomposed does not represent
the whole work of sunlight for the time, as water simultaneously is
attacked in order to supply the hydrogen of the carbo-hydrates.

P.    415,   Am.   de Chemie,     tom    xiii.   The fundamental chemical
re-action taking place in the leaf, may therefore be represented
as follows    : —
            (1)
                 - CO,O     +      H„O       =     CO,H,        +    O,O

    la the first equation carbonic acid and water            are simultaneously
attacked with the liberation of a volume of oxygen equal to that
of the original carbonic, together with the formation of a substance
having the composition of methylic aldelyde.              The second equation
represents the condensation of this aldelyde into grape sugar.                The
transformation induced in (1) necessitates the absorption of a large
amount of energy ; and if we neglect the heat evolved in the
combination of nascent CO and            H„ which can     be shown to be very
 little, the calculated result is      made a maximum         : whereas   the con
deusation of (2) being attended with an evolution of heat, diminishes
considerably the amount of power required.               Happily Frankland's
direct determination       of the thermal value of grape sugar leaves
no doubt as to the true equivalent           of work   done in its formation.
Taking the following thermal value CO,O = 68,000, Hr O                 =  68,000,
CJFIttO, = 642,000, lc centimetre of CO, decomposed                     as  in (1)
would require 6' 06 gramme units of heat, or its light equivalent;
whereas the complete change into grape sugar              of the   same amount
of carbonic acid requires only 4-78 gramme units. But we have
seen before 1 square decimetre of green leaf functions at the
rate of 5 '28cc of carbonic acid assimilated per hour, therefore
(5-28)     x  (4'78)  = 25-23 represents the number of gramme heat
units    conserved through       the absorption of light in the above
period of time.       Pouillet estimates the        mean total solar radiation
per square decimetre exposed normally to the suu's rays in or near
Paris per hour as 6000 gramme uuits, so that 6000 -h 25 23 =
represents the fraction of the entire energy conserved.                 The esti
mate is by no means       too  little,  as Boussingault      has shown the leaf
may function at twice the above rate for a limited time.
    In connection with equation (1),            above  given, as representing
the    action of sunlight    on   the leaf,    it is worthy of remark,        that

supposing the carbonic acid and water equally efficient as absorb
ing agents of the vibratory energy (although each has a specific
absorption for certain qualities of rays), then the decomposition of
the two compound molecules may take                place continuously    side by
side, owing to the equality of the thermal equivalents of carbonic
oxide and hydrogen. We already know, from the laborious re
searches     of Tyndall, how thoroughly aqueous vapour retains
thermal radiations ; and Janssen has further shown that the same
substance has a strong absorptive action on the rays of light of low
 refrangibility (just   those    rays that are in part selected by chloro
 phyll), producing the well-known atmospheric lines of the solar
 spectrum.       The presence, therefore, of varying quantities of
 aqueous vapour in the atmosphere in all probability produces                   a
 considerable difference of rate in the decomposition effected by the
 leaf, and may,      in fact,   end    in  carbonic     acid and water being
 attacked    in  another    ratio than that given as the fundamental
 equation    of decomposition.         Thus the     same     plant   in different
 atmospheric conditions may elaborate different substances.
 2.   On the Eainfall        ol the Continents           of the Globe.         By
     Alexander Buchan, Secretary of the Scottish Meteoro
     logical Society.
    This   paper   was illustrated by two large charts of the world
 showing, by    isohyetal    lines, the rainfall over the different conti
 nents in January and       July; two large charts showing the months
 of least and greatest rainfall in Europe, north Africa, and west
 Asia ; and by six sets of smaller charts of thirteen each, showing,
  by isohyetal lines, the monthly and annual rainfall of Europe,
  Asia,  Australasia,   North America,        Africa, and parts of South
 America.      The data laid down on         these    eighty -two charts were
 taken from a Table comprising about 2000 good averages of rain
 fall, calculated or collected by the author.
    On comparing the results of the rainfall with the author's charts
 of Atmospheric      Pressure and Prevailing Winds, published in the
 Society's Transactions,*       the broad    principles     regulating  aqueous
 precipitation   are chiefly these   : —

   1.  When     the prevailing   wind has previously traversed a large
extent of ocean, the rainfall is moderately large.
   2.  If  the winds are at the same time advancing                 into colder
regions, the rainfall is largely increased;       and   if   a range  of moun
tains lie across     their   onward path, the rainfall is also thereby
largely    increased on the side       facing  the prevailing        winds, and
reduced over the regions lying on the other side.
   3.  If  the winds, though arriving from the ocean, have not tra
versed a considerable extent      of it, the rainfall  is not large.
   4.  If  the winds, even though having traversed a considerable
part of the ocean, yet on arriving at the land proceed into lower
latitudes, or regions markedly warmer, the rainfall is small or nil.
3.   On the Lunar Diurnal Variation of Magnetic Declination
   at Trevandrum,          near   the Magnetic       Equator.         By  J. A.
   Broun,     F.RS.
   The author gives the results derived from different discussions of
nearly eighty thousand observations, made hourly during the eleven
years 1854 to 1864.        They  are as  follows: —
   1.  That   the lunar diurnal variation consists    of   a double maximum
and minimum in each month of the year.
   2.  That in December and January the maxima occur near the
times of the moon's upper and 'ower passages of the meridian ;
while in    June   and   July they occur six hours          later, the minima
then occurring near the times of the two passages.
   3.  The change of the law for December and January to that for
June and July does not happen, as in the case of the solar diurnal
variations, by leaps in the course of a month (those of March and
October), but more or less gradually for the different maxima and
minima.
   4.  While the lunar        diurnal   variation   changes the hours         of
maxima and minima           more  gradually than the solar diurnal varia
tion, it also makes the greatest change       at different times;      thus the
solar diurnal     variation   changes completely during the month of
March, or from February to April, while the lunar diurnal varia
tion makes the greatest change from April to May                    The  second

                           of Edinburgh,       Session 1871-72.                          757
great change which happens for the sun, between                        September and
November, occurs earlier, or between                  September and October for
the    moon.
  5.       The range of the variation is greatest in January, and is least
in May and October            ;   the arc, including the mean diurnal variation
for January, from eleven years' observations, being nearly                               0'-5,
.while in the latter months the ranges were nearly 0'-18 and                            0'-14
respectively;        the range for      July   being 0'-26.
  The author states, that, in a paper already published,*                              he has
shown that the range of the diurnal variation                   amounts sometimes
to five minutes (5'-0), which, from the less value of the horizontal
force, would be equivalent to about twelve minutes (12'-0) in Eng
land ; and that the diminution of range appearing in the mean of
many lunations is due to the combination of variations following
different laws.
   6.       The   ranges   of the    mean    lunar and mean solar diurnal varia
tions thus obey different laws with reference                    to the period         of the
year    ;   the range of the former in January being nearly double that
in any month from May to               September,     while the range of the latter
in August is nearly double that in January.
   In the discussion for the change of the law which might                             be due
to the moon's passing from one hemisphere to the other, the author
found different results for different months of the year                       ;    this led
him to perform the calculations in a new way, described by him,
in which the law derived from observations                      made during the day
is separated        from that obtained from observations made during the
night.         From this discussion it follows —
   7.       That the action of the          moon on the declination      needle          is,   in
every month of the year, greater during the day than during the
night; the range of the oscillation in January and June being nearly
four times greater during the day than during the night, the ratio
being less in the intermediate months.
      When the results            are derived from the forenoon hours only, or
 from the afternoon hours only, the range in January                      is       six times
 greater than that derived from the night hours only.
      It    also appears that the law derived from the            night hours varies
 little in the       course of the year;        it   is   only that derived from the

day hours which becomes inverted in passing from January to         July.
It follows —
   8.  That the principal, if not the only, cause of change in the
amount of the lunar action at Trevandrum, near the magnetic
equator,   for the moon on different meridians, depends on whether
the sun is shining on the place of the needle or not.
   The author finds —
   9.  That the     area of the  curve representing the lunar diurnal
variation in the mean of the group of months, October to April, for
the   half orbit   about Perigee, is to that for the other  half orbit  as
ri8 : 1 ;   while for the group of months, May to September, the
ratio is 1'31   : 1 ; the moon's action appearing to diminish      more
rapidly with the distance from the earth, when both moon and earth
are farthest from the sun.      As the mean distances of the moon  from
the earth in the two half orbits are nearly as      1 to 107, it appears
that the mean range for Perigee and for Apogee, derived from         loth
groups,  varies nearly as the inverse cube of the distance, as in the
case  of the tides.

                       by the Hon. Lord Neaves.
                                 (Abstract.)
   Lord Neaves      read a paper entitled
                                           " Some Helps to the Study    of
Scoto-Celtic     Philology," in which, after noticing the mistaken
tendencies of the Celtic scholars of former times, both Irish and
Scotch, as to the origin and affinities of Gaelic, and adverting        to
the fact now firmly fixed that it was an Aryan or IndoGermanic
tongue, he submitted a statement of some of the imitations              or
disguises which words underwent or assumed in passing into Gaelic.
Thus it was a peculiarity of Gaelic to avoid the letter p. which it

                     of Edinburgh,        Session 1871-72.                        759
 did in various ways.        Sometimes it dropped that letter, as when
 it changed the Latin Pater into Athir, the Latin piscis into iasg,
plenus into lan, &c.        Sometimes it changed the p into a gutteral
 c, g, or ch, as seachd for septem, feasgar for vesper.                 It   did this
 even  in borrowed     words, as when the Church term Pasch for Easter
 was changed into       Caisg ; the Latin purpur into corcur.                 It  was
 another peculiarity of Gaelic          to omit the letter n before           certain
 other consonants, so that centum became             cead, quinque    became coig,
 mentis,   mios  ; in/ernum,     ifrinn ; inter, eadar.         The    Latin     v  or
 English w    was   generally represented in Gaelic         at the beginning of
 words by    f:  thus   vir,fear;    verus, fior  ; vinum,   fion;    vates,  faidh ;
 <fec.  The old Irish word for a widow was fedb.                 Two remarkable
 prefixes occurring frequently in Gaelic, do and                so, correspond to
 similar prefixes    du and su in Sanscrit     :  do  and du meaning " evil or
 difficulty," and so and su meaning          "goodness or facility."           These
 prefixes are very abundant in those               two languages at the two
 extremes of the Aryan field, but though represented                also in Greek,
 are scarcely or very slightly perceptible in the intermediate tongues.
    An attention to these and other changes which words undergo
 in passing into Gaelic would greatly facilitate               the   study of this
 remarkable     tongue, which      it  is  not creditable to Scotchmen             to
 neglect as they have done.           The comparative forms of the inflec
tions of words also deserve attention, and on this subject reference
might be made to an interesting lecture on the Gaelic, by Professor
Geddes of Aberdeen.
    2. Some Observations on the Dentition of the Narwhal
           (Monodon monoceros).             By Professor Turner.
    The author    expressed   his concurrence with those anatomists who
hold that the two tusks of the narwhal are situated in sockets
in the superior maxillary bones,            and not, as was stated            by the
Cuviers, in the premaxillae, or partly in the pre- and partly in the
superior maxillae.     He then proceeded to relate some further observa
tions on the dentition of the narwhal, and pointed out, both in the
skull of    a young male and in those          of three well grown         foetuses,
an elongated canal on each            side  of  the upper     jaw, parallel and
inferior to the    tusk socket, which had the appearance of a socket

760                Proceedings    of the Royal Society
for a supplementary       tooth, although none protruded from it.         In
 the young male a minute denticle was seen at the bottom of this
socket.
   He then described      a dissection he had made      of the upper jaw of
 a male fetus, 7J- inches long, given him by Mr C. W. Peach, in
which, imbedded in the gum on each side, were two well-formed
dental papillae, barely visible to the naked eye.         Each papilla was
contained in a well-defined tooth sac.        Calcification of the papilhe
or of the wall of the tooth sac had not commenced.               The roinute
structure of these embryonic teeth was next described.             The more
anterior of the two papillae was -^ths inch behind the tip of the
jaw, and the more posterior lay about TVth inch behind the
anterior.
   No rudimentary teeth were found in the lower jaw.
   The formation of bone had only just begun in the fibrous matrix
of  the  maxillary bones ; but in the lower jaw a very decided ossifica
tion of the fibrous membrane investing the cartilage of Meckel had
commenced.
3.   On the occurrence of Ziphius cavirostris in the Shetland
   Seas, and a comparison         of its Skull with that of Sowerby's
   Whale {Mesoplodon Sowerbyi). By Professor Turner.
   This paper contained a brief historical sketch of Ziphius cavi-
rostris. The skull of a specimen caught at sea in 1870, off Hamna
Voe, Northmaven, Shetland, was then described,           and this skull was
compared with previously        recorded  specimens.      A  brief historical
sketch of Sowerby's whale was then given,        a  skull in the Edinburgh
Museum       of Science and Art was described, and reasons were
advanced     for associating it with the genus Mesoplodon rather than
with Ziphius.
4.  On the Maternal Sinus Vascular System of the Humau
                   Placenta.     By Professor Turner.
   The author gave       a brief sketch   of the various theories which
have    been   advanced    by Velpeau,    R. Lee, Braxton Hicks, the
Hunters, Owen, Weber,       J. Reid, J. Goodsir,   Virchow, Kolliker, Van

                  of Edinburgh, Session        1871-7'2.              761
Der Kolk, Arthur Farre, and Ercolani regarding to the relations of
the maternal blood-vessels to the placenta and chorionic villi. He
then proceeded to state the results of his own observations on various
specimens of placentae, some of which         had  been  separated at the
full time, others prematurely, and      on three specimens attached to
the uterine   wall.    Two of   these  latter were    from women at or
about the full    period of gestation, whilst the third was from a
woman who died undelivered in the sixth month of pregnancy.              In
one of the attached specimens a pipe had been introduced into              a
uterine vein in the broad ligament,         and  a coloured gelatine    in
jection had  been passed    along the venous sinuses in the muscular
wall, and the utero-placental     veins into the placenta.      The utero
placental veins were followed through the decidua serotina, and were
seen to pierce the uterine surface of the placenta.           The walls of
these veins were so delicate that they tore through on the appli
cation of very slight force.       Thin    sections made     through   the
placenta and the adjacent part of the uterine wall permitted the
author to trace    a  direct continuity of the injection       within the
placenta with that within the utero-placental          veins and uterine
sinuses, and showed the one to be continuous with the other.          The
injection also passed into veins of considerable size, situated within
the decidua reflexa, near the attached          border of the placenta.
In another    attached   specimen, the intra-placental      sinus system
was injected with coloured gelatine from a pipe inserted into one
of the uterine arteries, and the injection of the system of inter
communicating spaces within the placenta was as readily made as
in the specimen where the injection was passed through the uterine
vein.   In the third attached specimen, the injecting pipe was
introduced into the cut face of a section through the placenta itself,
and the intra-placental    sinus system    was not only    distended, but
some of the injection had even entered the utero-placental veins.
   Thin sections of the injected     placentae   had been made and ex
amined both with low and high powers of the microscope. Draw
ings, greatly enlarged, of the appearances seen on examining these
sections were shown to the Society, and the author pointed out that
these were to be regarded as actual representations of the objects,
and not, as had previously been almost universally the case, mere
 diagrammatic conceptions of what the anatomist might consider to

762                Proceedings of      the  Royal Society
be the character of the arrangement.          The chorionic    villi were seen
in these sections to be cut across longitudinally, obliquely, and trans
versely, and the     villi were   not in contact with each other by their
surfaces,but separated by intermediate freely-communicating             spaces,
filled with coloured gelatine.        These spaces constituted the intra-
placental maternal sinus vascular system.          Thin sections     examined
with high powers showed multitudes            of red-blood corpuscles lying
in the coloured gelatine, which corpuscles had undoubtedly been
in   these sinuses before      the injection   had been passed into them,
and from    their position    were the corpuscles    of  the maternal blood.
The ready manner in which the injection flowed into the intra-
placental    sinuses,   either when passed directly into the placenta,
or through the artery, or through            the  vein, the regularity and
uniformity of the pattern produced by the injection                  when   set,
and the abundance of blood corpuscles present in the sinuses,
mingled with the injection, seemed to the author to substantiate
the view that      these    sinuses are a natural      system   of   intercom
municating      spaces    for the   transmission    of  the   maternal    blood
through the interior of the placenta;        and not as some have main
tained, artificially produced      by the extravasation of injection from
the uterine vessels into the placenta.
    The author then        proceeded   to describe the structure of the
chorionic villi, to show their relations to the decidua serotina and
the decidual bars which pass into the interior           of the placenta, and
to discuss the views which have been advanced, whether the villi
hang naked in the maternal blood, or whether they are invested
either by a prolongation        of the lining membrane of the maternal
blood-vessels, or by the cells of the decidua, or by both.

   1.  On Dimorphic Flowers of Cephaelis Ipecacuanha,                        the
              Ipecacuan Plant.          By Professor Balfour.
    I have reported already to the Society (p. 688) the results of the
cultivation of the Ipecacuan plant in the Botanic Garden, and its
successful propagation         by   Mr M'Nab by root-cutting.            By this
means    it  has been sent    in considerable quantity to Calcutta, under
the direction of the Secretary of State for India. From the Garden
at  Kew, in    1863, a plant was sent      out to Dr King, and of late he
has been    successful  in  propagating it by cuttings of the stem above
ground.      So that from both sources there seems to be every prospect
of the plant being extensively cultivated         in India, the climate of
which in many places        is favourable for its growth.        The so-called
root of the Ipecacuan may be said to be composed of           a  sort of under
ground stem capable of producing leaf-buds, as well as true roots.
    I have already    stated that the plants in the Botanic Garden have
been derived from two sources,         — one from  a plant sent by Sir Wm.
 Hooker more than 40 years ago, and which he had procured from
 Mr M'Koy of Liege ; the other is from plants sent from Bio
 Janeiro by Dr Gunning.            There is an apparent difference in the
characters of the plants from these two sources,         but not such as to
 amount to a specific distinction.            Hooker's  plant     has    flowered
pretty freely, but never produced fruit until last year, when the
 pollen was artificially applied from one flower to another.               All the
 plants from this source have long stamens and short styles.
    The plants sent by Dr Gunning          have grown well, but       it   is only
 recently that they have flowered, and now there are several speci
 mens in flower, and some are fruiting after artificial impregnation.
 In this  series  of plants there     are  evident dimorphic       flowers.     In
 some the stamens are long and the style is short         ;  while in others
 the style is long, projecting         much beyond the corolla, while the
 stamens    are short.

764                Proceedings of     the Royal Society
    It  would appear that successful fertilisation     may be effected       by
applying the pollen from the long stamens to the stigma of the
long styles.
    The partial fruiting which took place in the heads of flowers             in
the Hookerian plants may have depended             on the fact that there
were only produced flowers with long stamens          and short styles, and
although      when pollen    was applied from one flower to another
fertilisation   was effected, still it was by no means fully successful,
only two or three of the flowers in the head producing fruit.               The

           Expedition.      By Professor Wyville Thomson.
    Seven    species  belonging   to the Echinoderm order Crixoidra,
                                "             "
were     procured during the       Porcupine     dredging expeditions of
 1869   and 70. Four of these belong to the free section of the order,
and are referred to the genus Antedon.
 1.  A. escrichtii, J. Miiller.
    This fine species is abundant off the coast of Greenland, but so far
 as   I  am aware, it does not occur in the seas of Scandinavia.
 Several hauls of the dredge in the cold area in the channel between
 Scotland and Faeroe, yielded many examples, the largest of which,
 however,    fell somewhat short of the dimensions of the largest
specimens from Greenland.           Antedon escrichtii was associated in
the Faeroe channel with Ctenodiscus crispatus, an Asteridean which
had     been   met with previously only in the Greenland              seas.    A
 single    example    of a pentacrinoid    in  an early stage      was   found
 associated    with Antedon escrichtii.    It resembled    closely the larva
 of Antedon sarsii, but the specimen was not sufficiently perfect for
 a critical examination.

  2.   A. sarsii, Duben and Koren.
      More or less complete specimens or fragments of this widely
 distributed species came up in nearly every one of the deep hauls
  of the dredge, from the Faeroe Islands to Gibraltar.                   One or two
  small examples of the pentacrinoid were procured in the Faeroe
  Channel.
  3. A.   rosaceus,   Linck.
     Frequent      in water of     moderate      depth.    Many examples of the
 form known         to continental naturalists under the name of A.
 mediterraneus,       Lam. sp., were dredged in the Mediterranean off the
 coast    of Africa.     I do   not feel satisfied that this is identical         with
 Antedon rosaceus of the coast of Britain, although the two specifio
 names       are  usually     regarded as synonyms.             There     is a great
 difference between them in habit            ;  a difference which     it  is difficult
 to define.
 4.   A.  celticus, Barrett.
     This    species,   which is at once distinguished            by the      extreme
 length of the dorsal cirri, is abundant at depths of 40 to 60 fathoms
 in the Minch, and we also met with it in local patches to 150
 fathoms off the north coast of Scotland.
     The remaining three Crinoids belong to the section of the Order
which are permanently stalked.                  Two of    the   three   are    new to
science,     and the third was discovered in the year 1864 by G. O.
Sara, in the deep water off the Loffoden Islands.
     Up to the present time two recent species have been described
belonging to the Family Pentacrinid^.                   Both of these were known
only    from    the deep   water   of  the   seas  of   the Antilles.       Since the
discovery of the first of these in the year 1755, they have been
regarded with          special interest, both on account of their great
beauty, and of the singular relation which they bear to some of the
most     abundant       and characteristic       fossils of the palaeozoic         and
mezozoic formations.
    Pentacrinus      asteria,  L., the   species    first described   by Guettard,
and afterwards very carefully worked out by Johannes                    Miiller,    has
a stem sometimes         nearly  a metre   in length consisting of a multitude
of discoidal joints about           every seventeenth         of   which      bears   a
circle of five long cirri which             spread     out rigidly and       abruptly

 766                Proceedings       of the Royal Society
 from   the joint, turning down hooklike            towards the tips.        Each
cirrus consists of about 36 joints.           The nodal joint, that is to say
the joint modified for the insertion of the cirri, is single; but it is
united to the joint beneath by a peculiar suture with much of the
character of a syzygy.          Most of the examples of        P. asteria which
 have reached      Europe have had the stem recently broken.               In  one
however in my possession,           the stem, which is unusually short, had
evidently given way at one of these joints long before the death of
the animal, for the surface          of the terminal joint is smoothed and
rounded, and the terminal          row   of cirri are curved over it This
example, at all events, must have lived for some time free.
    In Pentacrinus     asteria,   the basal plates of the cup project like
small round buttons over the ends of the salient angles of the first
stem   joint.    The first radials    are connected with the second radial        s
by a true    joint with muscles and ligaments, and the second radial is
united to the radial axillary by a syzygy.           There are from 70 to 120
pinnated arms.       There is constantly a syzygy on each branch at the
first joint beyond each bifurcation, but there are few syzygies on
the arms after their last bifurcation, although in some specimens
one is met     with  here and there.
    All the examples of P.      asteria in European museums have lost the
soft parts    and the disk;      but   I have  one example which          is com
plete.    The mouth is central, and five radial         grooves pass from the
edge   of the mouth-opening to the proximal            ends   of the arms, and
become     continuous with the brachial grooves, dividing with each
bifurcation.      The pertsom       of the disk is    covered    with   irregular
calcareous    plates, and at the free      inner angles of the interradial
spaces these plates become closer, and           form a solid kind of boss         ;
but there are no distinct oral plates.             A rather long anal tube
occupies    the centre of one of the interradial spaces.
    Pentacrinus mulleri, (Erstedt, seems to be more common than                 P.
asteria especially off the Danish West Indian Islands.               The whole
animal is more delicate in form.              The   stem    attains nearly the
same height, but is more slender.             The   nodes    occur about every
twelfth joint and at every node two stem-joints are modified.                 The
upper joint bears the facets         for the insertion of the cirri, and the
second is grooved to receive the thick            basal  portions of the cirri,
which bend downwards for a little way closely adpressed                     to the

stem before becoming free.          The cirri      are much shorter than in
P.   asteria.   The syzygy is     between      the two modified joints.       In
all complete specimens which          I  have seen, the stem     has evidently
been separated      for long at one of these syzygies.        I described some
years ago     a  specimen in which this was the case, and suggested
that in that       instance the animal had lived for some time free.
 I  have since seen several other examples in the same condition,
and   I believe    that the disengagement at a certain stage of growth
is habitual.      The arrangement of the joints and syzygies in the cup
is the same in      P. mulleri  as in  P.   asteria, only the syzygy between
the second radial and the radial axillary is not so complete.               The
arms are more delicate, and appear never to exceed thirty in num
 ber.   The number of syzygies is very variable; sometimes they are
confined, as in P. asteria, to the first joint after a bifurcation, and
sometimes they occur at intervals all along the arms.                The struc
ture of the disk is the same as in P. asteria, but its texture is more
delicate, and the calcareous pieces are smaller and more distant.
    On the 21st of       July  1870,    Mr Gwyn Jeffreys, dredging from
 the "Porcupine," at a depth of 1095 fathoms, latitude 39° 42' N.
 long. 9° 43' W., with a bottom temperature of 4°3               C, took about
twenty specimens of a handsome Pkntacrinus                    involved   in  the
 hempen tangles attached to the dredge.
 1.  P. wyville-ihomsoni, Jeffreys.
    This  species is intermediate       in some of its characters between
P. asteria and P. miilleri, it       approaches      the latter however most
nearly.     In   a mature specimen         the stem     is about 120 mm. in
length and consists of five to six internodes.             The whorls of cirri
towards the lower part of the stem              are 40    mm. apart,   and   the
internodes consist of from thirty to thirty-five joints.              The cirri
are   rather    short, and    stand out straight from         the nodal joint
or curve    slightly downwards.          There are usually eighteen joints
in the cirri, the last forming            a sharp claw.      As in P. asteria
the nodal joint is single, and a syzygy separates it from the
joint immediately beneath it which does not differ materially in
form from the ordinary internodal stem-joints.               All  the stems of
mature examples of this species end inferiorly in a nodal joint
surrounded by its whorl of cirri, which curve downwards into a

    768                    Proceedings          of the Royal Society
    kind of grappling root.              The lower surface of the terminal joint
    is in all smoothed and rounded, evidently by absorption, showing
    that the animal           has    long       been      free.       This     character       I   have
 already noted as occurring in some specimens of                                      P. mulleri    and
 in   one at least of         P.    asteria.        I have        no doubt whatever that it is
 constant in the present species,                       and that the animal               lives loosely
 rooted         in the soft    mud, and may change its place at pleasure
 by swimming with its pinnated arms                           :   that it    is,   in fact, interme
 diate in this respect               between            the free species            of Antedon and
 the permanently rooted fossil crinoids.
      A   young specimen of              P.     wyville-thomsoni gives the mode in
 which this freedom           isThe total length of this specimen
                                    acquired.
 is95 mm., of which the head occupies 35 mm.         The stem                                        is
broken off in the middle of the eighth internode from the head.
The lowest complete internode consists of 14 joints, the next
of 18, the next of 20, and the next of 26 joints.       There are
8 joints in the cirri of the lowest whorl, 10 in those of the
second   12 in those of the third, and 14 in those of the fourth.
            ;
This    the reverse of the condition in adult specimens, in all
          is
of which the numbers of joints in the internodes, and of joints
in the cirri, decrease regularly                    from below upwards.                   The broken
internode in the young example and the three internodes above
it   are atrophied and undeveloped                   ;   and suddenly at the third node
from the head the stem                            in thickness and looks as
                                          increases                                                 if
it   were   fully nourished.            There can be no doubt that in early life
the Crinoid         is   attached, and that              it   becomes        disengaged by the
withering of the lower part of the stem.
  The structure of the cup    the same as in P. asteria and P.
                                               is
mulleri. The basals appear in the form of shield-like projections
crowning          the    salient      angles        of the         stem.       Alternating with
these     we have        well-developed first radials forming                         a   closed ring
and articulating           to free second            radials by muscular joints.                   The
second         radials are     united by            a                    axillaries,
                                                        syzygy to the radial
which as usual give off each                two first brachials from their bevelled
sides.      A     second    brachial      is    united by syzygy                   to the first, and
normally         this second        brachial        is   an axillary,        and gives off two
simple arms         ;   sometimes,       however,          the radial        axillary originates
a   simple arm only from one or both                      of its     sides, thus reducing the

total number of          the    arms,   and sometimes           one    of the four        arms
given off from the brachial axillaries again divides, in which case
the total number of arms is increased.                     The structure of the disk
is much the same as in the species of the genus previously known.
   The Apiocrined^ to which the remaining two fixed Crinoids
must be referred, differ from all other sections of the order in the
structure of the upper part of the stem.                   At   a certain point consi
derably below the crown of arms the joints of the stem                                  widen
by the greater development of the calcified ring, the central cavity
scarcely increasing in width.                 The     widening        of    the    stem-joint
increases upwards until a pyriform body is produced,                             usually very
elegant in form, in which one would suppose                          looking at the out
side that the viscera were lodged.               It     is,   however, nothing           more
than    a     symmetrical       thickening    of the stem, and the body cavity
occupies      a   shallow depression        in the   top   of   it   inclosed within the
plates of the cup         ;    the basals    and radials are much thicker                  and
more fully calcified than in other crinoids, but they are normally
arranged.
     The   stem    is   usually long and simple, until near the base, where
it   forms some means of attachment;                  either as in the celebrated
pear encrinites of the forest-marble,            a    complicated arrangement of
concentric layers of cement which fix                  it     firmly to some foreign
body   ;   or as in the chalk Bourguetticrinus and in the recent Ithizo-
crinus, an irregular series of jointed branching cirri.
   The Apiocrinid>e attained their maximum during the Jurassic
period, where they are represented by numerous and fine species
of the genera Apiocrinus and Millericrinus.             The chalk genus
Bourguetticrinus shows            many symptoms of degeneracy. The head
is   small, and the arms are small and short.                   The arm joints are so
minute that         it   is   difficult to make up anything             like      a   complete
series from the separate fragments scattered                    through the chalk in
the neighbourhood of            a   cluster of heads.         The     stem, on the other
hand,    is   disproportionately        large and long, and one            is   led to suspect
that the animal was nourished chiefly by the general surface absorp
tion of organic matter, and that the head and special assimilative
organs    principally concerned in the function of reproduction.

The genus Rhizoorinus possesses all the essential characters of
the family.

1.   R.    lofotensis,     M.   Sara.
     This   species was discovered                in the year     1864, at a depth of about
300       fathoms, off the Loffoden                   Islands,    by G. O. Sars, a son of
the celebrated             Professor        of Natural   History in the TJuiversity
of Christiania; and it                was    described in detail by the latter in the
year 1868.            It   is evidently a form             of the Apiocrinidae still       more
degraded           than Bourguetticrinus, which it closely resembles.                       The
stem       is long and of considerable thickness in proportion to the
size of the head.               The joints of theindividually long
                                                               stem are
and dice-box shaped, and between the joints spaces are left on
either side of the stem alternately, as in Bourguetticrinus, and in
the pentacrinoid of Antedon for the insertion of fascicles of con
tractile fibres.           Towards the base of the stem branches spring from
the upper part of the joints                  ;    and these, each       composed    of   a suc
cession     of gradually diminishing joints, divide                      and re-divide    into a
bunch       of fibres which expand at the ends into thin calcareous
laminae,                      of shell, grains of sand —anything
              clinging to small          pieces
which may improve the anchorage of the crinoid in the soft mud
which is nearly universal at great depths.
     In   Rhizocrinus the basal series of plates of the cup are not dis
tinguishable.            They    are masked           in   a closed   ring   at the top   of the
stem, and whether the                    of the fused basals alone,
                                      ring   be composed
or of an upper stem-joint with the basals within it forming a
'' rosette " as in the calyx of Antedon, is a question which can
only be solved by a careful tracing of successive stages of develop
ment.       The first radials         are likewise fused, and form the upper wider
portion of the funnel-shaped                      calyx      The first radials      are deeply
excavated above for the insertion of the muscles and ligaments
which unite them to the second       radials by a true (or moveable)
joint.      One of the most remarkable points in connection with this
species     that the first radials, the first joints of the arm, are
             is,
variable in number, some examples having four rays, some five, some
six, and     a     very small number seven in the following proportions.
Out of seventy-five specimens examined by Sars, there were —
                                15           with            4   arms.

   This variability in     so important        a character, particularly    when
associated with so great a preponderance in bulk of the vegetative
over the more specially animal parts of the organism, must un
doubtedly     be   accepted   as    indicating a deterioration from the
symmetry      and   compactness       of the Apiocrinidae of the Jurassic
period.
   The anchylosed ring of first radials is         succeeded by a tier     of free
second radials, which are united by a straight syzygial                 suture to
the next series — the radial axillaries.          The surface of the funnel-
shaped dilation of the stem, headed by the ring of first radials, is
smooth and uniform, and the second radials and radial axillaries
present a     smooth regularly         arched outer surface.         The radial
axillaries differ from the corresponding joints in most other known
crinoids in contracting       slightly     above,  presenting only one arti
culating facet, and giving origin to a single arm.             The  arms, which
in the larger specimens      are from 10 to 12 mm.         in length, consist of
a series of from about twenty-eight           to thirty-four joints, uniformly
transversely     arched    externally,      and   deeply grooved within         to
receive    the soft parts.       Each      alternate   joint bears    a pinnule
alternating     on either side     of the axis of the arm, and the joint
which does not bear a pinnule              is united to the pinnule-bearing
joint  above   it by  a syzygy   :  thus joints with muscular connections
and syzygies alternate throughout the whole length               of the  arm.
   The pinnules, twelve to fourteen in number, consist of             a uniform
series of minute joints united by muscular connections.             The grooves
of the arm and of the pinnules            are bordered    by a double series of
delicate round fenestrated calcareous          plates, which, when the animal
is contracted and at rest, form a closely imbricated covering to the
nerve and the radial vessel with its delicate           caecal tentacles.     The
mouth is placed in the centre          of  the disk,   and  radial canals, equal
in number      to  the  number      of arms, pass     across  the disk, and are
continuous with the arm grooves.              The mouth is surrounded by a
 row   of flexible   cirri arranged nearly as in the pentacrinoid of
 Antedon, and is provided with five oval calcareous valve-like plates
occupying     the interradial      angles,   and closing over the mouth at
 will.   A  low papilla in one of the interradial species indicates the
 position of the minute excretory orifice.
    Rhizocrinus lofotensis is a very interesting addition to the British

  772               Proceedings        of the Royal Society
 Fauna.     We  met with     it in the Faeroe Channel in the year 1869,—
 three   examples, greatly mutilated,         at a depth of 530 feet, with       &
 bottom temperature of 6°-4 C.          Station 12 (1868) — Several occurred
 attached to the beards           of HoUenice off the Butt of the Lews,
 and specimens of considerably            greater size were dredged        in 862
 fathoms off Cape Clear.        The range of this species is evidently very
 wide.    It has been    dredged by G. O. Sars off the north of Norway;
 by Count Pourtales,      in the Gulf-stream off the coast of Florida ; by
                                    "                                             "

    The Genus Bathyordjus (n. g.) must also apparently be re
 ferred to the Apioorinid^, since the lower portion of the head
consists of a gradually expanding funnel-shaped piece, which seems
 to be composed     of coalesced upper stem-joints.
 1.  B. gracilis (a.  sp.).
    The   stem is long and       delicate, in one example of a stem alone,
 which came      up in the same haul with the one perfect example
 which was procured, it was 90 mm. in length.                     The joints  are
 dice-box shaped      as  in Rhizocrinus, long and delicate, towards the
 lower part of the stem 3'0 mm. in length by 0-5 mm. in width in
 the centre, the ends expanding to a width of 1'0 mm. As in
 Rhizocrinus, the joints of the stem             diminish    in length towards
 the head, and additions are made           in the form of calcareous lamina:
 beneath the coalesced      joints which form the base of the cup.
    The first radials are five in number. They are closely opposed,
but they do not seem to be fused as in Bhizocrinus, as the sutures
show quite distinctly.           The centre of      each    of the first radials
rises   into  a sharp keel, while          the sides    are  slightly depressed
towards the sutures, which gives the calyx                 a  fluted appearance,
like   a folded filter    paper.      The   second radials are long and free
from     one  another, joining         the radial    axillaries    by a straight
syzygial     union.    They      are   most    peculiar   in    form.  A strong
plate-like keel runs down the centre of the outer surface, and the
joint is deeply excavated on either side, rising again slightly
towards the edges.         The radial axillary shows a continuation of
the same keel through its lower half, and midway up the                 joint the

keel bifurcates, leaving a very characteristic diamond-shaped space
in the centre towards the top of the joint.                 Two facets        are thus
formed for the insertion of two first radials.             The number of arms
is therefore ten.         The arms       are perfectly simple, and in our single
specimen consist of twelve               joints each.     There is no trace of
pinnules, and the arms resemble              in character the pinnules oiBhizo-
crinus.     The first brachial is united to the            second      by a syzygial
joint, but after that the syzygies are not repeated, so that there is
only one of these peculiar junctions in each arm. The arm-grooves
are bordered by circular fenestrated plates as             in Rhizocrinus.
  Certain marked resemblances               in the structure of the stem, in the
structure of the base of the cup, and in the form and arrangement
of the ultimate parts of the             arms,   evidently associate Bathycrinus
with Rhizocrinus ; but the differences are very wide.                        Five free
keeled and sculptured first radials replace the uniform smooth ring
formed by these plates in Rhizocrinus.                The radial axillaries give
off each two arms, thus recurring                to the more usual arrangement
in the order, and the alternate syzygies on the arms, which form so
remarkable a character in Rhizocrinus, are absent.
  Only     one nearly complete specimen and a detached                  stem     of this
very remarkable species were met with, and they were both brought
up from the very greatest depth which has as yet been reached
with the     dredge,     2435 fathoms, at the mouth        of the Bay of Biscay,
200 miles south of Cape Clear.

this hope may possibly not be realised,    can as yet make only    I
rough approximations to an estimation of the temperatures of these
neutral points.
     So far as         I   am aware,        the phenomenon discovered by Cum-
ming         and     analysed     by Thomson             has       hitherto           been     described
thus   When the temperature of the cold junction is below the
         :
neutral point, the gradual raising of the temperature of the
other         produces       a   current      which       increases              in    intensity        till
the neutral point is reached, thenceforth                                diminishes;            vanishes
when one junction                is about as          much         above        the neutralpoint
as    the other is below              it,   and    is    reversed            with gradually in
creasing intensity               as the hot       junction             is    farther heated.            To
discover how my recent observation affects                               this statement,        I      first
simply heated one            junction of      a   circuit of iron and (hard) platinum
gradually to whiteness, by means of                      a   blowpipe, and observed                     th«
indications of         a   galvanometer — both during the heating and during
the subsequent cooliug when the flame was withdrawn.                                         The heat
ing could obviously not                be     effected       at all so uniformly                  as    the
cooling; but, making allowance for this, the                                    effects    occurred in
the opposite order, and very nearly at the same points of the scale
in the descent             and   in the     ascent.      [I    have noticed            a   gradual dis
placement of the neutral points when the junction was heated and
cooled several times in rapid succession                       ;   but as my galvanometer,
though         it   comes    very quickly to rest,                 is    not quite         a   dead-beat
instrument,        I   shall not farther advert to this point                      tillI     have made
experiments with an instrument of this more perfect kind, which
isnow being constructed for me.] The observed effect of heating,
then, was  rise from zero to 110 scale divisions when the higher
                   a
temperature was that of the first neutral point, then descent to 95
at   a       second    neutral point, then ascent                   to      a   third, descent to          a
fourth, neither of which could be at all accurately observed, and
finally ascent until the junction was fused.
   With an alloy of 15 per cent. iridium and                                85 per cent, platinum,
the galvanometer rose to 53'5 at                  a   neutral point, then fell to                      - 50
at   a   second, then rose to          a    third at     —   39-5, and thence                  fell, but I
could not observe            a   possible fourth neutral point on account of the

 fusion of the iron.       As shown   on the plate, the first of these occurs
 at about 240° C. of a mercurial thermometer.
    With another alloy        supposed  to be of the same metals, but of
 which    I   do not yet know the composition, also made into a      junction
 with   iron, the behaviour was nearly the same, but the readings at
 the successive      neutral points were 28,   - 137, - 132.    The tempera
 ture of the first is about 200° C. by mercurial thermometer.
    An iron-palladium circuit showed no neutral points within the
great range of temperatures mentioned above ; though it showed
a remarkable peculiarity which must be more closely studied, as it
appears      to point to the cause of the above effects in      a property of
iron.      It  was therefore employed to give (very roughly) an indica
tion of the actual temperatures in these experiments.              But  as  for
this purpose it is necessary to measure           the simultaneous indica
tions of two circuits whose hot and whose cold junctions are respec
tively    at the same temperatures,     I was obliged to employ a steadier
source of heat than the naked flame.           I therefore  immersed the hot
junctions in       an iron crucible  containing   borax glass, subsequently
exchanged for a mixture of fused carbonate of soda and carbonate
of potash      ; but, to my surprise, the former of these substances       at a
 red heat disintegrated        both the platinum and the alloy, and thus
broke both circuits        without sensibly acting on the iron, while the
mixture (evidently by the powerful currents discovered by Andrews,
Phil. Mag. 1837) interfered greatly with the indications of the
thermo-electric circuit, as will be seen by the dotted curve in the
plate.       [I may remark here that the deviations of this curve from
its form when these currents are prevented are quite easily observed
and plotted by the process next to be mentioned, so that the study
 of the Andrews' effect may be carried out with great accuracy by my
 method.]        Finally, determining to dispense altogether with fused
 salts, which                                                        I
                  conduct too well besides acting on the metals, simply
suspended a red-hot bombshell, vent downwards, in such a way that
 the hot junction was near its centre.            This arrangement worked
 admirably,       until  a white heat was required, for this melted the
shell.      In its   place a wrought iron tube (an inch in bore, four
inches long, half an inch thick, and closed at the upper end) has
 been substituted and answers        excellently.   It does  not cool too fast
 for accurate reading at the higher temperatures, and by elevating

it   by degrees from over the hot                 junction        we can make         the cooling
fast enough at the lower ranges.                         In     fact,   I believe    that    if I    do
not succeed in getting a sufficient number of practically                                   infusible

be able      to make a fair approximation                       to temperatures by simple
time observations made with the hot tube, surrounded                                        by some
very bad conductor,              such      as sand, where the surface                  in contact
with the air is always comparatively cool, and where therefore we
can accurately calculate the rate                  of cooling.
     Curves    I.,   II., III.,       in the plate were drawn by means                       of this
apparatus.  The hot junction consisted of an iron wire, palladium                    a
wire, and (for the several curves in order) —      Hard platinum          I.                              ;
II. Pt 85, Ir 15 III. The other alloy of Pt and Ir. The free

ends    of    the    palladium         wire, and of the platinum                    or alloy, were
joined to iron wires, and the junctions immersed in test-tubes                                 filled
with water resting side by side in    large vessel of cold water.

The other ends of these three iron wires, and the wires of the
galvanometer, were led to     sort of switch, by means of which
                                            a
either circuit could be instantly made to include the galvanometer.
Readings were taken of each circuit as fast after one another as
possible (with the galvanometer    employed about 6'5 seconds was
                                                I
the necessary interval), and the mean of two successive readings of
one    circuit   was taken as being at the same                         temperature as that of
the intermediate reading of the other.
     The indications of            these curves are very curious as regards the
effect of even         small impurities on the thermo-electric                        relations       of
some metals.           It   is   probable, from analogy, that the curve for iron
and pure platinum, in terms of temperature, would be (approxi
mately, at least       ;    even   if  it   should be the iron, and not the platinum
 metal, which        is   represented        by   a   broken or curved line)           a    parabola
 with        very distant vertex.                 And                      probable that when
                                                        it it   appears

 difference between            temperatures and the indications of an Fe-Pd

gents coincide at the points of junction, though the curvature
necessarily not continuous from one to the other.                 Hence, as at
it    a  fair approximation to the electro-motive force in terms of
'erence of temperature in the junctions, we may assume a para-
ic function, which up to a certain temperature belongs to one
 abola, then changes to another without discontinuity                  of direc-
g,   and so on.
Hence either the iron, or the hard platinum               and the platinum-
lium alloy s, will be (approximately, at least) represented on my
m of Thomson's thermo-electric diagram (ant6 p. 601) by broken
 es,   of which the    successive    parts are straight.       This, contrasted
th the (at      least nearly)     straight   lines for pure, metals, seems
 show that some bodies           take successively different states (i.e.,
                                                " critical "
come different      substances) at certain                    temperatures,   re
ining their thermo-electric properties nearly unchanged from one
 those critical points to another.
 The curve marked         IV. in    the figure was obtained by plotting
;ainst each other the simultaneous indications            of the alloy of curve
 L    and iron, and of the alloy of curve        II.  and iron, so as to avoid
iy disturbance from possible peculiarities of palladium.               Then, to
itain an idea of the share taken by iron in the results, it was found
 at the electro-motive      force  in  a circuit formed by the two alloys,
  by either with hard Pt, is (for a very great range of temperature)
nsibly proportional to the temperature difference of the junctions.
 The same result is easily seen from the plate,              if we notice that
ie   difference of corresponding ordinates in any two of curves                I.,
     III., is nearly  proportional to the corresponding abscissa.          Now,
 seems a less harsh supposition          that the lines representing pla
num and its alloys are nearly straight and parallel, while that of
on is a broken line, than that the latter should be straight                 and
ie former      all broken at the      same temperatures.          On the other
and, this latter hypothesis would make k alternately negative and
ositive in iron, while the former would only require the platinum
letals to have values of k alternately less and more negative than
bat of iron.
   1  may add that none of the above-mentioned              effects  can be due
o  altered electric    resistance of the heated junctions, because the
;alvanometer      resistance was about 23 B. A. units, while that of the

778                       Proceedings              of the Royal Society
iron and platinum wires together was in each case not more than
one such unit.             The palladium-iron                       circuit     was    so   much   more
powerful than the others that a resistance coil of about 146 B. A.
units had to be inserted in its course.
  Assuming, for a moment, that, as above suggested as at least
approximately true, in one of the wires we have <r = At< up to
the temperature tv a~ = kjt up to temperature                                    <„   &c, we have    by

     I reserve    farther developments of this subject until                    I have       made
a    sufficient    number of experiments                with       bothjunctions at high
temperatures,           particularly      when       these   are    two of the series of
neutral     points      ;   and especially until        I    manage       to settle, by one at
least of several processes              which have occurred to me, whether the
multiple neutral points depend upon peculiarities in the behaviour
of the iron, or of the platinum, or of both.
   [Added during printing.                 I

line, for the platinum metals, that of hard platinum being below the
lead line, while those of most of the other alloys are above                              it,   and
that the multiple neutral points depend upon the peculiar sinuosity
of the line for iron.          I      have also obtained curious results of              a   some

to.explore the part of the thermo-electric                    diagram included between
the lines of gold and palladium, by making                         a   multiple arc of these
two metals, and varying the ratio of their separate resistances.                                But
I    reserve details         until

      2. On   a   Method of Exhibiting the Sympathy of Pendulums.
     While making            some magnetic        experiments lately with                Mr Fox
Talbot,  I    happened          to notice that two equal rectangular pieces of
tin plate, when standing nearly parallel to one another on the pole
of   a   large electromagnet, acted on one another so that                          a   vibration
communicated to either was in                    a   few seconds handed over to the
other, and vice versa.
     The definiteness of the result led                 try the experiment with
                                                       me to
ordinary bar magnets.                 Taking two large magnetised bars of almost
exactly equal mass,           I      suspended    them with their axes in the same
horizontal  line, so that their (small) vibrations were executed in
that line, their undisturbed periods being very nearly equal, and
the distance between them (when at rest) so small compared with
their lengths, that we need consider only the magnetic action of
the two poles nearest together.                   With this apparatus the transfer
of energy from one                   pendulum to the other              is   mostbeautifully
exhibited,        for   if   one only be in motion                at starting, the magnets

780                 Proceedings       of the Royal      Society
alternately   come       sharply to rest at successive        equal intervals         of
time.    This arrangement           makes an excellent and instructive           class
experiment, and its value may be greatly increased by placing round
the exterior end of one of the magnets a vertical coil of copper -
wire connected with a distant galvanometer.                  The nature of the
motion of this magnet at any instant is readily deciphered from
the signals given by the reflected light on the galvanometer scale,
which    is also visible to the whole class.             A   more complex,           but
with practice easily intelligible, signal is given by placing the coil
round the contiguous ends of the magnets.
 The extension of this arrangement to three, four, and more equal
magnets, all vibrating in one line, and of nearly equal mass,
magnetic power, and (independent) period is of course obvious, and
forms a beautiful mechanical illustration of the solution of a differen
tial equation.
   In thinking how most simply to explain                    such results       to an
elementary class,        I was    led to the following, which can hardly be
new, though     I have      never met with it, but which is certainly not
as   well known     as   it ought to   be.      Take first the     case    of the two
equal magnets.
     Since there are but two moving parts of the system, and each
has but one degree of freedom, it is obvious that             if   we can find two
different forms of motion of the system which,                 once       established,
will persist for    ever, any motion      whatever of the system must be a
mere superposition        of these two        modes   with arbitrary amplitudes
and epochs.        Now, one such       mode     is obviously the motion of the
pendulums      as one     piece    at their    equilibrium   distance from one
another.  As the magnetic force does not vary during this motion,
the time of vibration is that of either pendulum when left to itself.
The other fundamental            mode is that    in which the centre of inertia
of the two remains fixed, i.e., the simultaneous                 displacements        of
the two magnets are equal and in opposite directions.                       The time
of small oscillations now will evidently be the same as               if   one of the
magnets were held fixed and its magnetic strength doubled.                            It
will, therefore,   be shorter or longer than the former period, according
as the poles       presented      to one another attract or repel, and its
actual value is easily calculated.            Hence, as these small motions
separately can be represented by expressions such as cos (mt                     +    t),

                     of Edinburgh,             Session 1871-72.                                  781

will   be the same       to a spectator who changes the side from which
he regards them in successive                such intervals.              Thus,   if one   magnet
was originally                will alternately be reduced to rest.
                    at rest, the two
   When there                             it is easy to see that one
                    are three equal magnets,
fundamental mode is a swing of the whole as one piece, a second
(if we suppose like or unlike poles adjacent to each other at each
gap) is the middle magnet and the centre of inertia of the other
two fixed, and the third has also the centre of inertia fixed, but the
two extreme magnets are at each instant equally deflected                                   in the
same direction, while the middle one has a double deflection to the
opposite side.      It   is troublesome, but not difficult, to think out the
fundamental modes for four and even for five magnets                              ;   but it would
be a waste of time to         try it in that       way for more.
  Generally       if xr denote        the displacement at time t of the rth
magnet, and      if we assume       the masses, magnetisation, and gaps to be
equal, we have

     Thus ps  =  nJ, or n*(l    + 3e), or          + e).    There is no farther
difficulty in applying the method to magnets of different masses                     or
magnetic strengths;        but it is interesting       to observe     that, by pro
perly adjusting the gaps in terms of the masses and magnetisation
of the bars, any set of magnets whatever can be brought to behave
(for small oscillations) as if they were in all respects equal to each
other and arranged at equal distances.
    When    there is an infinite series      of magnets arranged in this          way
the equation above may          be  written
 where
of which the general integral is easily found.
     When the number of magnets (m) is finite, and they are arranged
 in a closed curve, we have the conditional equation
                                 (Dm
                                      -   l)*r   =  0.
 In this    case the general solution         may be elegantly expressed             in
 terms of the mft roots       of unity.     It  leads   to some curious proper
  ties of determinants, whose development will form an excellent
 exercise for the student.         Thus, writing in succession         1 , 2 , ..... m

 The form of its minors, on which          depends       the solution of the pen

  them we in turn easily obtain the value of the same determinant
 when bordered, as it will be in the pendulum case                  if  the series of
  magnets be finite       and not closed.      The question forms a very in
  teresting illustration of the linear propagation of disturbances in                a
 medium consisting of discrete, massive,              particles — when only con
 tiguous ones act on one another.           For, if     we put

 which, with n     = 0 ,   is the usual equation for sound, provided the
 particles repel one another.            Of course      we can easily extend the
 investigation    so as to include         the more complex cases where the
 mutual actions of all the poles are taken into account.                    The result
 is not altered in form       ;   but it might be curious to inquire whether
 the retention of    n2  in the equation might not give some hints as to
the formation of a     dynamical hypothesis of the action of transparent
f-olids on the luminiferous           ether.     This, however,      I   cannot enter
upon at present.

     As one example of the important                 results derived from           these

written

   This, and similar   formulae, are applied in the paper to find the
potential and vector-force due to various distributions of magnetism.
To show how this is introduced, I briefly sketch the                   mode   of ex
pressing the potential of a distribution.
   Let  er be the vector expressing the direction                 and intensity of
magnetisation, per unit of volume, at the element ds.                    Then   if the
magnet be placed in a field of magnetic force whose potential is u,
we have for its potential energy
                 E =
                       -£/S(a-V)uds
                    =
                         JflTuS(yo-)d<:
                                            - tfuS . U vtrds      .
This shows    at once that the magnetism may be resolved                       into a
volume-density S(Va-), and        a   surface-density        -S    . XSva- . Hence,
for a solenoidal distribution,
                                 8.V<r     = 0.
   What Thomson       has called a lamellar          distribution (Phil. Trans.
1852), obviously requires that
                                    S . <rdp   _
be integrable without a factor;        i.e., that
                                 V.Vo-     =  0.
A complex lamellar distribution         requires that the same expression
be integrable by the aid of a factor.           If  this  be u, we have      at once
                               V.V(t«r)      = 0,
or
                                S.<»-V<t-    =   0.

786                  Proceedings      of the Royal Society
With    these preliminaries     we see at once that (d) may be written
 JfV.(y.<rVv)rds       =  -Jpf.rN.Vrdi           - J%f\ .<rVrdt     + JffSaV.tik.
Now,   if t =            where   r is the distance       between     any external
point and the element ds, the last term on the right is the vector-
force exerted by the magnet on a unit pole placed at the poiut.
The second       term on the right vanishes by Laplace's equation, and
the first vanishes as above           if the distribution       of magnetism be
lamellar, thus giving Thomson's result in the                 form of a surface
integral.
   Another    of the applications        made    is to Ampere's Direcirice       de
Vaction   ekctrodynamique, which (Quarterly                Math.    Journal, Jan.
1860) is the vector-integral
                                     J    xy'
where    dp is    an  element of a closed circuit, and the integration
extends round the circuit.          This   leads again to the consideration
of relations between single and double integrals.
   [Here it may be well to note that, by inadvertence, I wrote <r
for t towards the end of the abstract of the former part of this
paper, thus    giving the result        a false generalisation depending on
the fact that     t had been made subject to the condition
                                   S  . Vt  = 0 ,
while no such restriction was imposed on             <r~.   With this restriction
most   of the results already given (Proc. ante p. 320) are correct,
but the general forms in the paper itself are as follows, being
deducible at once from the first expression in the abstract                 : —

    Returning    to the electrodynamic    integral, note that it may be
written
so that, by the corrected formula just quoted, its value as a surface
integral  is

                        . UvV . V
                                  -rds -JJ   VvV*   ±  ds.
Of this the last term vanishes, unless     the  origin is in, or infinitely
near to, the surface over which the double integration            extends.
 The value of the first term      is seen (by what precedes)     to be the
 vector-force due to      uniform  normal   magnetisation    of the   same
 surface.
    Also, since
 we obtain at once
 whence,   by differentiation, or by putting  p + a for p, and expanding
 in ascending powers of To (both of which tacitly assume that the
 origin is external to the space integrated through, i.e., that Tp no
 where vanishes), we have
 and this, again, involves
    The interpretation of these, and of more complex formulae of a
  similar kind, leads to many curious theorems in attraction and in
 potentials.    Thus, from (a) we have

this becomes
By putting         <r = p,   and taking the scalar,              we recover a    formula

                                YJfUvUpds            =      0.
This may      be easily verified from the formula

5.   On the Currents produced by Contact of Wires of the
     same Metal at different              Temperatures.             By W. Durham,
     Esq.    Communicated by Professor Tait.
   At the suggestion of Professor Tait, undertook the investiga

tion of the momentary thermo-electric current developed when two
conductors or wires of the same metal are brought into contact, the
one being at       a   different temperature from the other.
     Platinum      was chosen    as the most suitable metal to experiment
with, in the first instance, as         it   is   free from the       interfering   action
of oxidation       at high temperatures.

                                                                        "
                       of Edinburgh, Session 1871-72,                                 789
   The following arrangement of apparatus was employed :—
   1. A long iron bar, one of those used by the late Principal
Forbes in his experiments on the conduction of heat, was heated
at one end in the usual manner. This formed the source of heat at
once steady and graduated, so that, by contact with it at various
parts, the platinum wire experimented with could be kept at any
required temperature.
  2. Small glass tubes were            fitted into holes in the bar at regular
intervals, and turned over a little at the edge in the form of a lip.
These served the double purpose of preventing metallic contact with
the bar (and thus introducing ordinary thermo-electric currents),
and also served as guides to the same point of contact in each
experiment.
  3.   A   sm all iron bar kept at the temperature            of the room.
  4.   A
       reflecting galvanometer (with somewhat massive mirror
and magnet, so as to "integrate"), with a scale placed at the dis
tance of six feet, so that the smallest deflection of the needle could
be readily observed           and measured.
  5. Two      pieces    of the     same platinum       wire connected with the
galvanometer in the usual manner.
  The      mode   of working     was as follows :— The free end        of   one     of the
platinum wires rested on the small bar, and was thus kept at the
temperature of the room.              The     free   end of the other wire was
placed in one of the glass tubes on the heated bar, and, while in
that position, and after it had attained the temperature of the bar
at that particular       spot,    the wire from the small bar was brought
into contact with       it,   and the sudden deflection of the galvanometer
needle noted.
  With this arrangement very                  good    and    steady results          were
obtained when care was taken to keep the wires perfectly clean,
and to apply the same amount of pressure               in making contact in
every experiment, because            any deficiency of  contact increased the
resistance so as greatly to affect the currents.
  The results show that for platinum wire the current,                  as indicated
by the deflection of the galvanometer needle,                is   exactly as the      dif
ference of temperature between the two wires.
  To show the steadiness of the results,              I     give the details of one
experiment —

 6.   Kemarks on the Deep-Water Temperature of Lochs
      Lomond, Katrine, and Tay.                      By Alexander Buchan.
    In  the communications              made   by Sir Robert Christison             to  the
 Society in December and April last                on the deep-water temperature
 of Loch Lomond, from observations                   made      by him with a Miller-
 Casilla thermometer,          these important facts were stated             : —
    (1.) On 12th October 1871, the temperature at the surface was
 52-°0, from which it fell, on descending, till at 300 feet below the
 surface it stood at 42°-0, and this temperature of 42o-0 was uni
 formly maintained at greater depths or to                     518   feet, the depth      of
 the loch at the place of observation.
    (2). On 18th November following, the surface temperature was
 46°-0 ; at depth of 250 feet, 42°-25 ; at 270 feet and lower depths,
 42°-0.
    (3.) On the 10th April 1872, the temperature at the surface was
 43° 0 ; at 150 feet, 42°- 1 ; and from 200 to 594 feet, 42°0.
    Hence it appears that there is a stratum of water of considerable
 thickness at the bottom of this loch of uniform                    temperature      ; that
 the upper surface of this stratum of deep water of uniform tempera
 ture was about 100 higher on the 10th of April than it was in the
    * Results varied considerably owing       to working so neur the flame      — varying
 from 104° to   126°-

792               Proceedings       of the Royal Society
beginning of winter, or on the 18th November;               and that   this  deep
water temperature probably remains constantly                 at, or  very near,
42°0.
   Sir Robert   asked me for a statement         of the temperature       of  the
air at Loch Lomond          from    18th November         1871   to 10th    April
1872, or    during the time that the cold stratum of water of the
uniform temperature of 42°-0 had increased about 100 feet in
thickness.     This I have prepared from the observations made at
Balloch    Castle, by    Mr David Hill, the observer of the Scottish
Meteorological Society at that place. Balloch Castle is at the foot
of the loch, and 72 feet above its surface. The table showed the
mean temperature of each day during the time, — the mean of the
maximum and minimum temperatures of each day being assumed
as the mean temperature        of that day.      Of this table   an abstract   is
given below, from which          it  appears   that the mean temperature,
from
       November 18 to 30 was 38° 0, or 2°-5 below the average,

    The average temperature of the          145 days was      417, which l°-4
 above the average of past years.
    Taking the    observed    mean    temperature of each day for Edin
 burgh as calculated by the late Principal Forbes,* and applying to
 these   the differences observed       between   Balloch Castle and Edin
 burgh, the normal temperature of each day at Balloch Castle was
 calculated.    In this   way the divergence of the temperature of each
 of the   145 days from its normal was ascertained.             The amount for
 each day was given       in  a table,  —temperatures       above   the average
 being given in red ink, under the average in blue. An abstract of
 this table is given below, from which it appears that there were
 four cold, and four mild periods, as under          : —

    Hence during this period the temperature was under the average
of the   season on 51 days, the deficiency         amounting to a mean of
3*   4; and above the average      on 94 days, the excess      amounting   to
a mean of 4°-0.       The most markedly mild period extended over 69
days, viz., from 11th January to 19th March, during which the
temperature was on an average of 3°-9 above that of the season ;
and as already stated, the temperature was, for the whole period of
145 days, l°-4 above the average.
     It may  be concluded      that in ordinary      winters the stratum of
water     of uniform     temperature will be thicker        than Sir Robert
Christison    found it to be this year in the beginning        of spring; in
other words, that it will be nearer the surface than 170 feet.
     In the  end   of last week, Mr James Leslie, C.E., kindly sent me
some     highly interesting and valuable observations on the deep-
water temperature of Lochs Tay, Katrine, and Lomond, made by
the late    Mr James Jardine, C.E., in           1812   and  1814.   These   I
 have now very great pleasure in laying before the Society.             They
were taken in fathoms, and the temperature in degrees centigrade

    These results are strikingly accordant with those obtained by
 Sir   Robert Christison,          The difference as regards the deep-
 water temperature of Loch Lomond may be, and probably is, only
 instrumental.
    These observations were made in the summer and early autumn,
 or when the temperature of the sea and of lakes is about the
 annual maximum.          Taken in connection with Sir Robert's observa-
 sions, they warrant the conclusion that the deep-water temperature
 of Loch Lomond remains during the whole year either absolutely
 at, or very nearly at, the low figure of 42°-0.
    The observations also show that this is not a peculiarity of Loch
Lomond, but that it is also a characteristic of Lochs Katrine and
Tay, and most probably of other deep waters.
    The mean annual temperature of the air at Loch Lomond, from
the mean      at Balloch      Castle, calculated on the 13 years' average,
ending      1869,  is 48°-0,* which is 6°-0 higher than the uniform
deep-water temperature of the loch.              The deep-water     temperature
   * In this and following
                              temperatures 0' 2 has been added, in order to bring
them to the level of the loch, which is 72 feet lower than the thermometers at
Balloch Castle.

                      of Edinburgh,      Session 1871-72.               795
is, therefore,     not determined by the mean annual temperature of
 air over this    part of the earth's surface.
    From Forbes' "Climate of Edinburgh,"it is seen that the tempera
 ture there is under the annual mean from the 21st October to the
 26th April. Assuming that this holds good for Balloch Castle,
 then the mean temperature for the cold half of the year will be,
 from —
                 October     21 to 31,     .     .    .    46°-0
                 November      1  to 30,  .      .    .    41°- 7
                 December      1  to 31,   .     .     .   40°-9
                 January       1  to 31,   .     .    .    38°"6
                 February      1  to 28,   .     .     .   39°-8
                 March         1   to 31,   .     .    .   40°-5
                 April         1  to 26,   .     .    .    45° 8
  The mean of      these 188 days is therefore 41°-4.
     The close approximation of this temperature of 410-4 to 42°-0,
  the deep-water temperature of the loch, is such as to suggest that
  it is the mean temperature      of  the cold half of the year which deter
  mines   the  temperature    of  the lowest  stratum of water at the bottom
  of deep   lakes, so long as the deep-water temperature does not        fall
  below that of the maximum           density of the water. As this prin
  ciple, if established, would be of great importance in many ques
  tions of physical research, such as the deep-water temperature of
  the Mediterranean       Sea, which     Dr Carpenter has very accurately
  ascertained,    in its connection     with the larger question of general
  oceanic circulation,    it well  deserves further investigation.
