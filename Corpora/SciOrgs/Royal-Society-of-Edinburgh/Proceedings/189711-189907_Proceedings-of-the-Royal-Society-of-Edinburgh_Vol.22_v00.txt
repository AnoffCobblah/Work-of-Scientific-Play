                         (Read December   6, 1897.)
    The President, on opening the Session, stated that —
    At   the  statutory meeting, held on 23rd November            1896,    the
President     was appointed     (with power to name         a  substitute) to
represent    the Society at the British Association Commission on a
National Physical Laboratory.
    At  a meeting of Council on      7th May last, the President and        Dr
Murray     were appointed members of the Consultation Committee             in
 connection with the proposed Catalogue of Scientific Literature.
     At a  meeting on 21st May 1897,       Dr Murray, Dr Traquair, and
 Mr Cadell of Grange       were  appointed to represent       the Society at
 the International     Russian Congress      at   St Petersburg,   and   Prin
 cipal Talmage was       subsequently added         to the  above-mentioned
 representatives.
     Professor   D'Arcy Thompson,       a member        of our Council, was
 reappointed a Commissioner to report on the aspects of the Seal
 Fishery in Behring's Straits, and on its international relations.
     In  consequence    of a letter from      Mr Wragge,      requesting   the
 Council to express an opinion as to the establishment of High and
 Low Level Meteorological Stations       on and near      Mount Wellington,
 New Zealand, in view of the establishment by the local autho
 rities there of such Observatories, a Committee of our Council was
 appointed to consider      the subject, and reported on the great         im
 portance of obtaining a fuller knowledge of the meteorology of the
 countries bordering on the Southern Ocean, and on the deficiencies
 that at present exist    as regards  Low Level Meteorological Stations
 to the south of the Argentine          Republic,     to the north    of Cape
 Colony, and in the Islands of the Southern Ocean south of lati
  tude 30°, to which may be added        the observations that might be
  obtained through antarctic expeditions        ;  and that these deficiencies

are still more conspicuous in regard to High Level Observatories
and      contiguous   Low Level Observatories,                 good positions       for which
might be obtained in Australia, New Zealand, and Tasmania ; and
the Committee further thought that as the atmospheric pressure
was singularly low and uniform over the Southern Hemisphere,
where a close          and intimate         connection is shown between low
pressure     and cyclones with the attendant anticyclones, that this
is   a   part of the world where problems of weather can be most
successfully investigated.
     Professor Playfair states in his Life of Hutton (published in
vol. v. of our Transactions) that the two volumes on the Theory
of the Earth, which that great geologist gave to the world in 1795,
"    do not complete         the Theory, a third, necessary              for that purpose,
              behind, and is still in manuscript                  "                             It
remained                                                              (January 1803).
was at first supposed           that as Hutton 's collection of minerals had
been      presented to the Society,               this    unpublished            MS. volume
might also have been presented,              and might be in the archives of
the Society, but the most exhaustive search led to no indication                                of
its ever having been           in our    possession.          The lost trace of it that
could be found is in Note C. to a paper                       on Glen Tilt, read to our
Society on 16th May 1814, in which Lord "Webb Seymour, one of
the authors      of   it,                Playfair had promised to
                            states that Professor
give him   sight of the manuscript of the third volume of Hutton'a
             a
Theory of the Earth which
                           " was left
                                        unpublished at the time of
Hutton's death, and           is   nearly ready for the press."
     After the failure of our          search,    we were agreeably              surprised to
learn from Sir Archibald Geikie (in  letter dated 16th June 1897)
                                                   a

been acquired by Leonard                Horner, and presented by him to the
Geological       Society's Library.              Unfortunately         it   is   only   a   small
part of the whole volume, beginning                      with Chapter        IV.,       and end
ing with Chapter IX^

place on the 22nd of           January next, and the Society will                       be much
interested    in the results obtained by such                 a   competent observer.

   It  is usual, on the opening of a new Session,        to say a few words
respecting      each of the Members        of the Society who have        died
during the preceding Session, and          I now proceed to discharge that
duty   ;  hoping, however, that fuller and more adequate            obituaries
may      be communicated        by the pious solicitude of friends         and
relatives for the memory of the departed,          which the short notices
I  now give are not intended to supersede.
    Of Mr Edmond Chisholm Batten              an obituary notice    has been
prepared by his son, Major Chisholm Batten, and will be read at
an early meeting.
    Professor     Matthew       Charteris     was   born in the village      of
Wamphray, in Dumfriesshire.             His father  was parish schoolmaster
there,     and it was from his father that he received            his earliest
education.        From     the  parish school   he proceeded     to the   Uni
versity of Edinburgh, where, in his Arts course, he distinguished
himself by the composition of Latin verses.            Applying himself to
the study of Medicine,           he graduated   as   M.D. in 1863. After
leaving college he practised successively          in London, Airdrie,     and
 Glasgow.        He   was    appointed Physician     to the  Glasgow Royal
 Infirmary,      and in 1876      he obtained    the  Chair   of Practice    of
 Medicine      in Anderson's      College, Glasgow.       In   1880   he   was
 appointed to the Chair of Materia Medica and Therapeutics                   in
 the University     of that city.     He was well known to the profession
 for his researches into salicylic acid and chloroform.           He  was the
 author of    a  work entitled The Practice of Medicine, and also of a
 handbook on Health Resorts.           He wrote the paper on " The Treat
 ment of Diseases by Climate," in Quain's Dictionary of Medicine.
 He died on 7th Juno 1897.              He was elected a Fellow of this
 Society in 1896.

     Professor Hexby Drummond was born in 1851 in Stirling.                               He
was educated there and in Crieff.                    Thence lie proceeded to Edin
burgh University, and was medallist in the Geological Class under
Professor Archibald             Geikie.        He afterwards went             to the     New
College, Edinburgh,             whore he qualified             for the ministry of tin-
Free Church, and he also studied at Tubingen, in Germany.                                 He
left    College    in   187G, and in the          following      year was appointed to
the      Lectureship       on   Natural        Science     in    Glasgow Free        Church
College.        In    1879 he accompanied            Professor Geikie upon           a scien
 tific expedition        to   the    Rocky      Mountains        and Colorado.         Three
years later he was sent out to East Central                      Africa, for the purpose
 of reporting upon the natural resources of Nyassaland.                         Just   before
 going upon          this journey        he published his          Natural Law in          the,
 Spiritual World.              This bouk        had    a   large    sale.    In    1884,  the
 Lectureship in the Free Church                     College,      Glasgow, having been
 endowed, he became             it-s  first occupant.          Some     time after he pub
 lished his       Tropical Africa,          a  record of his         travels in the dark
 continent.         During     the spring of 1890              he went out to Australia,
 and from there he crossed                 to the South Sea Islands, and visited
 Java, the        Malay     Peninsula,        and Japan,         returning     to   Scotland
  through      North America.             Among the works he published were,
  The Greatest Thing in the World, The Programme                           of Christianity,
  Pax     Vohiseum.        In    1893 he went to            Boston, U.S.A., to deliver
  the Lowell        Institute     Lectures, and in the following                summer      he
  lectured     at several      American        universities.        These    lectures    were
  published      in the spring of 1894 under the title of The Descent of
  Man.        In the autumn of 1894 he was seized with persistent
  rheumatic       pains and        catarrh of the stomach.                He   repaired,    on
  medical advice, to the South of France                     ;  but after residing there
  for several months, he returned to England, taking up his residence
  at  Tunbridge Wells, where he died on 11th March 1897. He was
  elected a Follow of this Society in 1880, and contributed a paper
  to  its Proceedings on "The Termite                  as   the Tropical       Analogue of
  the   Earthworm."
      Mr George         Elder      was born at        Kirkcaldy in November             181 G,
   and was educated        at the    High School        there.     As    a very young man
   he was   attracted by the enterprising life of                  a colonist,    and in the
   early days     of the Australian           colonies    he had serious        thoughts of

vented the fulfilment        of his wish at this time     ; but after a year    or
two spent in Canada,         Mr Elder, who in the      meantime    had  married
Miss Jean Balfour, was able to accomplish his early intention,                and
sailed  to Australia      with his wife, where he joined the business"
already established        in Adelaide,     South    Australia,   by his    elder
brother,   Mr Alexander Lang Elder, with whom in those                 days was
associated the second brother, Mr William Elder.                After five  years
of great commercial         success he returned to his native land,           and
on the shores of the        Clyde lived     a secluded    and thoughtful life.
He was elected         a  Fellow of this Society in 1869, and died at
Knock     Castle,   Largs, on 22nd July 1897. — {Communicated                  by

    Professor Matthew          Foster Heddle was a native of Orkney.
He was appointed to the Chair of Chemistry in St Andrews                     Uni
versity in 1862, on the death of Professor Connell, whose assistant
he was, and held the professorship           till 1884, when he retired.       He
 was widely known as a distinguished mineralogist, and was elected
 a Fellow    of this Society in 1876, and was awarded the                  Keith
 Prize.   He had been President of the Scottish Geological Society,
 and was    a member        of other learned      bodies.    Ho  died   on 19th
 November 1897, about 70 years of age.
    Mr Thomas Brumby Johnston was the son of Andrew                        John
 ston, Penicuik,    and Isobel, daughter of Archibald Keith, owner of
 Polton Paper Mill.         He was born in Perth on the 28th January
 1814, and after being educated         at several     private schools in Edin
 burgh, joined his brothers        — the late Sir "William Johnston and
 Alexander Keith Johnston, LL.D. — in the firm of W. & A. K.
 Johnston.     In 1843 he married Jane, daughter of Thomas Ruddi-
 man,   and   last,    it is believed,     of the    family   of that eminent
 philologist and grammarian.          In   1872    he published his   Historical
  Geography of     tlie Clans     of Scotland, and was also the author of
 several other geographical          works.       He was a member of the
 Scottish Society of Antiquaries, who, in 1872, presented               him with
  a handsome    piece of plate as a token of their grateful estimation of
 his services to that Society.        He was also a member          of the Geo
  graphical Societies     of Edinburgh       and London, and was elected         a
  Fellow of this Society in 1867.          He died on 2nd September         1897.

 Inveresk in 1806.           His father    waa   Sir David Milne, G.C.B.           Sir
 Alexander received his education successively at Musselburgh, Ports
 mouth, Bordeaux,           Halifax, and Bermuda, his            places of schooling
 being    in  a great measure       determined by the situation of the com
 mands held       by his father.      He  was subsequently entered as a pupil
 at the    Edinburgh Royal         High School, and        thereafter,   in 1817, he
 entered the navy as a volunteer and midshipman on the                   " Leander,"
 which carried        his father's flag.       In  1825     lie was lieutenant, in
 1830     commander       ;  and while    in command          of the " Snake," in
  1837-38, he captured           four slavers off the coast of Cuba, setting
 free    952 slaves.        He  was   acting captain in 1839, and in 1842
 became      flag captain to his father.          In   1847,    while commanding
 Nelson's ship        "Victory,"     Captain Milne was installed            a  Junior
  Naval Lord of the Admiralty,           and was nominated Superintending
  Lord of the Store, Victualling,            Transport,     and Medical       Depart
  ments, — in all of which         he introduced great reforms.            He was at
  the  Admiralty for upwards of eleven years.                  In recognition of   his
  work he received        in 1855 a good service pension,             was gazetted a
  G.C.B. after the Crimean War, and was promoted                    to rear-admiral's
  rank in 1858.        In   1859 he quitted     Whitehall     to take the command
  of the  North American and West Indian Stations. He was appointed
  Vice-Admiral       in 1865, Senior Naval Lord of the Admiralty in 18G6,
  Commander-in-Chief           of the Mediterranean         Station in 18G8, and
  Admiral in 1870.           lie  was again   invited to become        a Lord of  the
  Admiralty     in  1872, a position which he resigned           in 1876.     He  was
  created a    Baronet in 1875, and became Admiral of the Fleet in 1881.
     In dealing with the grant of £30,000           a year    which had been made
  by  Parliament for the benefit of petty officers and seamen, his plan
  for the   introduction of good conduct badges and pay was adopted.
  Previously there was nothing to mark the good from the bad or in
  different men.       At his instance    the first Signal Book was drawn up
  by  Captain    Wilmot, and      he established the first Cipher Secret Signal
  Book for     communication between the Commander-in-Chief and the
  Admiralty.        He  was the means of bringing under the notice of the
  authorities    at Whitehall     the defenceless     state of Jamaica, Antigua,
  Bermuda, and Barbadoes,          and of securing the strengthening of their
  defences.     He   was one of the Commissioners of the 1851 Exhibition,

of the British Colonial Department of the 1878 Paris Exhibition,            and
was Vice-President     of the Geographical Societies          of London     and
Edinburgh, and Fellow of the Royal Society.                He was elected       a
Fellow of this Society in 1833.          On the death of Lady Milne he
gave £500     to establish    what is  called the Lady Milne Memorial
Fund, to perpetuate the charities which she had been in the               habit
of giving.    He died on the 29th December           189G.
   James    Francis Montgomery         was born      in Edinburgh in 1818,
and was the son of      Mr Robert Montgomery,           who    for some years
held the office of Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer.            His grandfather
was   Sir James Montgomery,        Bart., of Stobo Castle, Peeblesshire,
Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer.              He was educated        through
private tuition, and entered the law classes at Edinburgh University.
In   1840 he was called to the Bar.       The bent of his mind lay more
in the direction of the ministry, and with the view of qualifying
himself for that vocation he studied        at the- University    of Durham.
He was appointed to the curacy of Puddleton, Dorsetshire, and after
spendingtwo years there he returned to Edinburgh           as curate to  Bishop
Terrot, who then held the incumbency of St Paul's, York Place.                In
 1864   Mr Montgomery      was chosen as junior      incumbent, and on the
death of Bishop Terrot       in 1872 Mr Montgomery was promoted to
the incumbency.       Bishop Cotterell appointed         him to the office of
dean, rendered    vacant by the death of Dean Ramsay.              But for the
infirmity of partial deafness there can bo little doubt he would have
been selected    for even higher promotion.            The fine peal of bells
 placed in the tower of St Mary's Cathedral was his gift.               On the
occasion    of his being    promoted    to the    deanery,    his alma mater
 conferred   on him the degree of       D.D.      He   was occupied     with all
 sorts of philanthropic work, and his tall and commanding             presence
 will bo greatly missed    in his native city.     He was elected     a  Fellow
 of this Society in 18G8. He died on 21st September 1897.
    Professor James Gkeig Smith was born in 1854, near Aberdeen,
 and was sent to the Grammar School and the University of that city.
 In  187G he   obtained the degrees of Bachelorship of Medicine and
 Mastership of Surgery.        In that  year he was elected to the post of
 Assistant or Junior House Surgeon at the Bristol Royal Infirmary,
 and in 1879 was placed on the staff as      full surgeon.     Some time after
 this appointment he published papers on the Pathology and Treat

qical Journal.          In   1888 he began to lecture on Surgery.               His   best
known      work, entitled Abdominal Surgery, has gone through six
editions, and has been translated into French, German, and Italian.
He died on 29th May 1897.                        He   was elected    a  Fellow    of this
 Society in 1883.
     Rev.   John "Wilson. — A              large    circle of the     Fellows    of this
 Society, more       especially      those    interested    in mathematical      science,
 will retain       an    affectionate      remembrance        of the late Rev. John
 Wilson,     M.A.       I  am glad to say that a notice              of him has been
 prepared by       Dr Knott, and will            be read at next meeting.
     Emile Dubois-Rbymond                 was     born in Berlin,     of French-Swiss
 parents, and       studied     first at the French Gymnasium and after
 wards at the University             of Berlin.      Under the tuition of Johannes
 Miiller he devoted himself to the investigation of the phenomena
 of animal magnetism,           and his researches          led him to discomfit the
 vitalist   school     of physiologists, who affirmed the existence                   of  a
 general    magnetic        vital    fluid.     With     Helmholtz     and   Mayer, he
 showed that biological phenomena                     are governed by physical and
                                              '
  chemical     laws.      His     famous        ignoravimus,'     as  opposed     to   the
  'ignoramus' of the Agnostics, bore witness to his readiness                            to
  dogmatise     wherever he felt certain of his conclusions.                     Besides
  conducting      successfully      scientific investigations, he acquired great
  renown as a populariser of science.                  He  was elected an Honorary
  Fellow of this Society in 1892, and                 died on 26th December 1896,
  at the age    of 78.

  after  having      acted     as     Lecturer     on Mineralogy        at  Sortie,   was
  appointed     in   1845      Professor        of Zoology      and Director      of the
 Zoological Museum at Copenhagen.                       He retired from his       profes
 sorial office   in  1885.      He     was the author of a number of scientific
 publications,      and was        elected     a  Fellow of this Society in         1881.
 He died on the 20th of            June     1897, at the age of 84.

Prize, still less obtain a Fellowship.                He   was called to the         Bar     in
1850,     but he mainly devoted               himself to teaching.       He was        Pro
fessor of Natural Philosophy              at University      College,    London,      from
1837 to 1844, then Professor of Mathematics at the                       University          of
Virginia.     Eeturning to England, he was made, in 1855,                       Professor
at the Royal       Military Academy, Woolwich.                   Fifteen years        later
he retired, and      in    1877 he was appointed the first Professor                         of
Mathematics in the newly founded Johns Hopkins                    University at
Baltimore, and was           editor of the          American Journal of Mathe
matics.      In    1883    he       was   elected    Savilian     Professor     of    Pure
Geometry in Oxford.                 Elected    a    Fellow of    the    Royal     Society
in 1839,     he received        a    Royal     Medal    in   1860,     and the Copley
Medal in 1880.        It    is unnecessary          to mention the various        foreign
societies of which he was an Associate.                    He was elected a       Fellow
of this Society in 1874.         His contributions to mathematical science
are thus described         by Professor Cay ley : — "They relate chiefly to
finite analysis,    and cover by their subjects                 a large part of        it, —
algebra, determinants, elimination, the theory of equations,                          parti
tions, tactic, the theory of forms, matrices, reciprocants,                 the      Hamil-
tonian numbers, etc."               He died on 15th March 1897.

1S97-93.]       Note on   Indian Earthquake, \2th June 1897-                 11
A Short           Note on the Disturbance of the Magnetical
        and Meteorological Instruments at the Colaba Ob
        servatory during the Earthquake of 12th June 1897.
        By N. A. Moos, Director of the Observatory.
                               (Read December 6, 1897.)
     The four instruments,        the traces of which are examined,    are the
 declination, horizontal force, and vertical force magnetographs, and
 the barograph.         The instruments being not seismological, the fol
 lowing discussion of the character           of the disturbance, based upon
 the traces of these instruments, must obviously be regarded              as an
 attempt       at  explanation,     and  as  an   attempt only.     Colaba, it
 appears, was situated well outside the area of perceptible shaking,
 and the distance of the Observatory from the centre of disturbance,
 whether suboceanic          or otherwise, was sufficiently large to render
  the disturbance as it reached Colaba very feeble, and yet it was
 just sufficiently strong to leave some, record of its peculiar charac
  teristics.    All  traces   have   been   enlarged   about two and    a  half
  times, but the exact        time and measurements        have been derived
  from the original       traces.
     It  must be noted here that the disturbance fortunately occurred
 just after 16 hours, the time of hourly eye observations.             A valu
  able  opportunity therefore was secured, and it became possible to
  note and     study the peculiar behaviour of the instruments during
  their disturbances, some of which, by the rapidity of their move
  ments, could not have         been photographed.       There may be some
  floubt as to whether the disturbance in the magnetographs           was due
  to mechanical or magnetic action, but no such doubt can exist for
  the barograph.        The disturbance of this instrument must have
  been   caused by distortional waves, or due to tilting of the instru
  ment.    • It will be  noticed that the maximum effect of the disturb
  ance, as    photographed in the barograph        trace, followed the largest

wave shown by declination and vertical force                               magnetographs          later
by about one minute.
     With    regard to the disturbed trace                     of the declination           magneto-
graph, on the other hand, it is difficult to conceive how                                   condensa
tion or distortional                 waves      could affect         the    suspended         magnet
under an exhausted                  receiver, so as to set up large vibrations                    in it
simulating magnetic action.                               mechani
                                                The magnet was disturbed
cally, no doubt, by the seismic waves, and these disturbances were
typical of mechanical action.    The three motions (besides    the
vibratory motion) observed in the declinometer at the time of
disturbance showed     (1) motion of the whole magnet parallel to
itself (east and west); (2) motion of the magnet as a whole north
and south ; and (3) the slight bobbing motion of the ends of the
magnet up and down.                       Lut neither of        these motions would              show
increase of the scale reading,                  nor would vibratory motion, if set tip
by mechanical             causes, permanently show                   increase     or decrease          of
declination.         It   is true that violent motion of any one of the                         types
referred to may           so   disturb the magnet               as   to bring one end          or the
other of the magnet in slight contact with the damper, which may
result in vibrations            ;    but the intensity of the mechanical disturb
ance was feeble, and the motion observed at the time                                    of the dis
turbance      showed           no         evidence    of any      great,     much     less    violent
movements.    Finally,                    the peculiar character of the trace of this
instrument, as will be                    seen later on, leaves            no reasonable        doubt
that the disturbance                  was      due    to    magnetic        action    which must
have    accompanied                 the    seismic    disturbance,         possibly   as     effect    of
a cause.
     The    ease    of    the        horizontal       force     magnetograph          is,   however,
different.         From the peculiar nature                    of the bifilar suspension,              it
becomes obvious                that the tension            of the wires being           a    principal
factor in the general                formula for the condition of equilibrium,
                                                                                                       of it
must       be affected         by any sudden               displacement        of the points
suspension.          A distortional                wave,    for instance,       suddenly lifting
the points of suspension,                   would result in increasing           the tension, and
any sudden          depression             would for       a   moment reduce the tension.
A     lateral movement,               also,   is   likely to temporarily alter the con
ditions of equilibrium, and this magnetograph                               therefore       appears to
be disturbed by the combined                         action of both the mechanical                    and

magnetical          disturbances — in this instance more,           perhaps,     by the
latter than by the former, which was feeble, as stated above.                         The
 trace     shows some evidence          of being affected by two causes super
imposed upon each other, specially at the end of the disturbance,
 where the           blurred    trace,  probably due to change           in the      focal
 distance caused by a slight displacement of the                      mirror, appears
 suddenly         to pass from a faint        to a somewhat deep            impression,
bounded by convex curves.
       Movement         in the vertical force magnetograph        now remains to bo
 inquired        into.      This instrument     is under an exhausted           receiver,
 but its knife-edge is somewhat               faulty, and this magnetograph               is
  therefore       peculiarly sensitive to       shocks — an accidental fall of             a
  lamp-chimney,           heavy tread of visitors, and even         a slight knock of
  the hand,       results in dislocation of the curve.            And     such   disloca
  tions     being frequent, special         care  is always     taken to guard the
   instrument        from such accidents.
        And yet no dislocation of the curve is noticed during tho earth
   quake,     which more or less establishes          the fact   that the movement
    of the   earth must have been very feeble.              But the instrument does
    show    vibrations, which naturally leads to the inference that they must
    have been caused          by some magnetic        action,  the first vil (ration      of
    which is timed to have taken place               exactly when the declination
    trace   is  just   lost by the second wave.         And it would thus          appear
    as   if the seismic        convulsion was in some way the cause of the
     magnetic      action, the latter phenomenon running               parallel to tho
     former,     increasing as it increased,        and subsiding      as   it  subsided,
     every seismic        wave having      its companion effect in a magnetic
     wave.
         With regard         to the direction,    since   the barograph would            not
      show any       indication of direction, nor the magnetographs,                 all of
      which appear to have been disturbed by the magnetic                    action,   it is
      dilScult to come to any definite conclusion.                Except, perhaps, in
      the case of      declination, the suggestive       explanation given later on,
      if  true,   would point, at least, that the direction was inclined more
      to   'east    to    west'   than to    'north    to   south.'    And from          the
       mechanical      disturbance of the magnets          of the two instruments,

the disturbance    in both  was from east to west.     The focal  distance
of the latter instrument also appears to be slightly affected, due        to
motion of the mirror east and west; it strengthens,        therefore,   the
presumption that the direction of the waves must have had a         strong
easterly component.       And the comparative feeble motion of        both
parallel to north and south direction, shows         that the  northerly
component       was present  but was feeble.    We shall now examine
each trace separately.

light every two hours for four minutes and a quarter.      The middle of
this break, therefore,   represents  16  hours on the 12th June.      The

found that        an exposure of about four seconds to the usual kerosene
burners (of about four candle-powers intensity) used, is enough for
action; and with regard to impression of light during the vibra
tion     of the magnet, it is found that oscillations of amplitude of
3i division         of the         scale, equal to a displacement of                           about 28
minutes        of declination and upwards, are not recorded                             ;   the velocity
of the speck         of light, together              with the motion of the paper,                           a

of the        amplitude, where the velocity is                      a   minimum.              It    is only
when the vibrations             fall    to   within    about        1J divisions of            scale that

accompanied          by   a   temporary disturbance of the magnetic                                  circula
tion.      The first wave, which appears to have just commenced                                             the
disturbance         in    the instrument,        must        have       passed Colaba at about
5     minutes       past four.          The     seismic       disturbance then                 seems         to
have      grown in intensity, and                    about     7        minutes past               four     the
increased         amplitudes (which, by the way,                        it   must be noted, were
first performed            about    a   higher zero showing                  a   decreased          easterly
 declination,       movement of the curve in the downward                                          direction
showing          an increase)       passed      the limit      above         referred        to,    and the
 trace   is    entirely lost.       Immediately after this, however, the impul
 sive force appears           to have ceased, and the damper of the magneto-
 graph        reducing the amplitudes
                                   [the logarithmic decrement has
 been ascertained  to be = "035] brings them within the limit of
 photographic action, and the trace    just photographed at about

 diately afterwards the trace                   is   lost,    to appear           faintly     again,        but
 more strongly            than before, at about eleven minutes.                             This goes on         ;
 but the magnetic             action now becomes less and less intense (presum

this, and every wave                       is registered         — following its         predecessor             with
more          or less rhythmic precision,                        the intensity of the disturbance
getting less and less, till at about                              34 minutes past the hour the
disturbed trace runs into normal curve once more.
     However, one                    singular feature in                   the trace, which is clearly
visible in the latter part of the disturbed                                      curve,       must also be
explained, viz., the running of the vibration                                    lines into each other
by        a zigzag    kind of           trace.       The most plausible explanation appears
to bo the following.
      Assuming the normal curve to be the zero for the time, ordinary
vibrations caused by                       a     momentary disturbance would take place
above and below this zero                            with   equal          amplitwles.        But from            the
nature of the appearance                             of the zigzag curve, it seems                    as    if    the
advancing seismic                       wave        of condensation           caused     a    decrement in
the declination,                 and      compelled vibrations about                     a    displaced zero
higher up the curve;                      while during the receding wave,                       as    it    passed
away, the reverse and opposite effect followed, and the declination
increasing, the vibrations were caused about a lowered zero,                                                     each
phenomenon,               of course, having its maximum and minimum effect.
Fourteen such                   waves          in    all can be detected            on        the trace,          the
second or third of which — more possibly the second — -was the most
intense,        and each complete wave was followed by another after                                               an
average interval of about two minutes,                                 — the maximum             effect of the
advancing and the retreating parts of the wave being recorded                                                      at

      It will be      seen that the beginning of the seismic disturbance, as
recorded         by this instrument,        shows   that it was somewhat          sudden
and      abrupt, and the rise to the maximum after the commencement
was      within three minutes           to four minutes, while the falling off, as
shown by the clear trace, appears to have taken place gradually and
steadily         till  normal     conditions were       reached.     From      the very
regular trace          it appears   that the time of vibration of the magnet
must bear a certain relation to the period of disturbance, the exact
time       of vibration        being some even sul>-multiple           of the period,
 otherwise the regularity             of the vibrations would be disturbed by
 '
    interference.'
       The average displacement of the declination east or west during
  the fourth wave, which is well defined,                would equal that due to         a
   change      of   '00034   C.G.S. units, in    terms of force.
       If   by producing the curves            on each side we      get the     probable
   amplitude        of the most intense wave where the two lines meet, the
   average      displacement appears to        be -15  inch, equal to '00051 C.G.S.
   units,    in   terms of force    ;  and this shows that the second wave was
   the most intense.
        The magnetic disturbance of the kind                registered    on   the   trace
    appears     suggestive of some kind of fluid action or of some kind of
    undulatory        action.      The    phenomenon appears         as   if  due   to an
    agitation      of a fluid endowed          with magnetic      properties     in some
    large     subterranean       cavity,    upon   which     the  indications      of the
     Colaba magnets          at least    partly depended,      and as    if  the seismic
     convulsions       produced waves in this fluid which,           approaching the
     instruments at Colaba and passing away from them, caused the alter
     nate   fall and rise of declination, these waves following each other
     regularly at an interval of two minutes.              And any    such wave must
     travel     east to west      at right angles     to the declination       magnet to
     affect   it with maximum         effect — passage of such waves due north to
     south    having no influence on the declination.
        The trace here (fig. 2) shows the disturbance in the horizontal
     intensity, which appears to have commenced early, about 2 \ minutes
     after  four, while the instrument shows that the disturbance did not
      end before      36 minutes past four.        The sudden displacement          of the
     curve    at the beginning shows that the vibrations must have been
     performed about a displaced zero above the curve, showing increased

intensity to about -00004 C.G.S.         units,  and the action appears
therefore more magnetic       than mechanical.        At 5i minutes past
four the vibrations pass the limit of photographic action, and this
perhaps marks the time of commencement           of the more intense oscil
lations.   The trace appears faintly at about 19i minutes past the
hour, less faintly at the extreme       ends of the amplitudes      than at
the middle of the curve, and it continues faint till about 26 minutes
past,  when   the   trace  darkens, but continues        disturbed   till   36
minutes past four, when the normal curve is resumed.               The time

of vibration of the magnet       has  been ascertained     to be 8 seconds,
and   obviously,  as   this factor, together with the       period of dis
turbance,   must   influence the motion of the magnet,          the  irregu
larity in the trace is perhaps to      a considerable   extent due to that
cause.
   The trace shown here (fig. 3) is that of the vertical force magneto-
graph.    As pointed out elsewhere, this instrument is very sensitive
to shocks,  resulting in dislocations of the curve.       No   such disloca
tion is detected during the earthquake.         The unusual thickness      of
the vibration trace shows that the cause of the disturbance could

minute, while the movements              shown in the trace lasted for over
three minutes.             The first wave appears to have commenced                     the
disturbance at 6''5, attained the maximum at about                    8',   and ended
at about       10' past    four.   The second        commenced   immediately after
this,    reached      its maximum effect at about 12', and ended at 14'
past four.

which show          the    two waves clearly.         The maximum effect of the
first disturbance coincides in time with the               greatest disturbance in
the declination magnetograph.              The amplitudes of the vibrations
above the curve are somewhat             smaller than those below the curve
(this   is   more clearly shown       in vertical force No.      2), which shows         a
slight   decrease      in vertical force during       the time of disturbance.           It
may be noted that the time of vibration                    of this magnet      is   5   "35
seconds      — about      the same as that of declination magnet.

   Fig.  4  shows the disturbance in the barograph curve,           which
appears    to  have   commenced      at about 5"5 minutes     after four,
attained its maximum effect         at  about 9'"5, and ended at     about
12'"5 past four.     The oscillations in the column of mercury must
have been caused      by more than one distortional     wave  ; and    it is
                                   Fig.  4.
interesting to note how the disturbance, which commenced           in this
instrument     about half  a  minute     behind that of the declination
magnetograph,     reached its maximum effect fully one minute after
the maximum effect is recorded       in declination magnetograph.      The
oscillations of the column    as  photographed would correspond to a
fall of mercury    to about -07 inch.

On the Velocity of Graded Actions. By James                                               Walker,

     The theory of mass action leads to very simple                                  consequences
when applied to the                        determination of the velocity of chemical
processes which take                      place in homogeneous            solution.       If      the re
action is pure and irreversible, the initial concentrations                                       of the
reacting substances have only to be known in order to obtain                                              an
expressionwhich shall give for every value of the time (measured
from the beginning of the reaction) the corresponding extent to
which the            action        has     taken place, one constant              being      involved.
This constant, which is characteristic                            of the reaction, is called its
velocity constant, and for a given medium                                and a given tempera
ture is invariable.                  Reactions have been classified                by Yan't             Hoff
into unimolocular, bimolecular, trimolecular, etc., reactions, accord
ing to the number of molecules which interact                              ;   and to every class
there       corresponds              an equation            by means of        which the velocity
constant is determined,                     the expressions          for the constants differing
from eacli other in form from class to class.                              For    example,         if    the
initial concentration of each of the reacting                             substances         be    A,    the
time t, and z the               extent to winch the action has progressed                          at the
end of the time                 f,       then the        following   expressions      will     be       con

remain         constant.        In      actual chemical processes,                   however, it is
only rarely that we find strict accordance                             with the theory.              Most
frequently          we can account            for the divergences               by the disturbing
effect      of secondary reactions,               change in the medium as the reaction
progresses,         etc.,    and can         occasionally            exclude    these      disturbing
factors      by suitably selecting the experimental conditions.                              A       great
many         reactions,       nevertheless,            give     numbers which             cannot        be
brought into harmony                     with the theory given above, unless                         they
are      considered         from    a   standpoint            essentially different from that
adopted           in forming the            ordinary          chemical equations          devised       to
express        them.        Thus, for example,                 the oxidation         of ferrous sul
phate       by potassium chlorate in presence of excess of sulphuric acid
is expressed         by the equation,
                                    = KC1 +
            KC103 + 6FeS04 + 3H2S04         3Fe2(S04)3 + 3II20                                   .
This equation would show that the concurrence of seven molecules,
if    we     exclude          of the sulphuric acid, is necessary for the
                            those
reaction       to take place.   But Hood * found that the reaction obeys
the      bimolecular formula under the most varied conditions.                                        The
action       of    bromic      acid on hydriodic                   acid leads to      a   similar dis
crepance.           The chemical equation is
                            HBrOg       +   6HI   =    HBr     +   3H20 + 3I2    ,
which assumes that seven molecules interact.                                  The actual rate at
which the action proceeds by no means conforms                                  to this conception
of    it.     If   -we   adopt the           theory of electrolytic              dissociation, the
chemical equation becomes                    still     more     complex,      and the divergence
between the theoretical and the                        actual course of the reaction still
more        marked.         Van't Hoff himself studied two specially simple
cases       of this kind, viz., the decomposition of arseniuretted hydrogen
and of       phosphuretted hydrogen.                     We usually          express these decom
positions by means of the following                           equations—
                                                  =

indicating that             the reactions are quadrimolecular.                         Van't Hoff's
experiments          showed,            however, that both obey very exactly the

law of unimolecular actions.                  He was therefore         forced to    conclude
that in these     cases the      action takes place in two stages, viz.              —

                                                    =             ,

                                               2H = H2,
 and    that the     velocity        of the       first  stage     alone    determines        the
 velocity of the whole reaction.                    Now that this         may    he   so, the
actions of the second           stage must         proceed    at    a rate    immeasurably
 greater   than    the rate of the first stage.                  An analogy may serve
 to  make     this point clear.             The time     occupied in the transmission
 of a telegraphic     message depends              both on the rate of transmission
 along   the conducting wire and on the rate of the messenger                              who
 delivers the      telegram      ;  hut it is obviously this last, slower rate
 that is of really practical          importance in determining the total time
 of transmission.        When we measure, then, the rate of                      a  chemical
 change    which proceeds in two stages, that stage which proceeds
 most slowly plays the principal part in determining the rate of                            the
 whole reaction, being only more or less modified by the other more
 rapid changes.         If    these       are   indefinitely     faster    than the       slow
 change,     their modifying             influence      will   be    so   slight   as   to    be
 negligible,    and   the really complex              action will appear to obey the
 formula of a simple           pure      action     within   the limits of the experi
 mental error.
    According to the hypothesis of electrolytic dissociation all re
 actions which take place between                   acids, bases, and salts in aqueous
 solutions at finite concentrations must he complex                        reactions    of the
 kind considered above           ;  for in these circumstances             the dissociation
 is never     complete.        If    the action       takes   place     between     ions,   the
 undissociated      portion must at each instant partially dissociate                         in
 order to restore the dissociation equilibrium                 ;  for the same reason, if
 the reaction involves directly the undissociated molecule,                          the ions
 must    reunite progressively              as   the reaction       goes   on.     We know
 that the processes of electrolytic dissociation and reassociation                           are
 practically instantaneous,             on the evidence of our ordinary chemical
 experience      and of the            rate of      change    in the resistance          of an
 electrolytic solution with varying conditions of dilution, etc.                          They
  exert,  therefore,     little    or no modifying influence                 on the    rate of

intermediate system B ; and let the actions he irreversible.                                               If   the
action A-»B is indefinitely faster than the action B->C, then the
total action A-»C will proceed at a rate determined solely both
as to type and numerical value by the rate of                                    B-»C       ;    and   if A-»B
is indefinitely slower than B-»C, the rate of A-»C will be that
of A-»B. Should the rates of the two actions be comparable
 with     each other, the rate of                 A-»C will fall under                  no simple type,
 and will differ essentially from that of any pure reaction.                                               A    case
 of this kind was studied by Harcourt                                   and Esson, the pioneers                   in
 the field of reaction velocity, and                              a   very complete             mathematical
 treatment is given in an appendix to their paper by Esson.*                                                   This
 paper,     although frequently                      cited,       has     been altogether neglected
 from the point of view of graded                             reactions.          The process studied
 by them was the reduction of potassium                                       permanganate          by oxalic
 acid.     In   presence         of manganese                     sulphate it takes place in two
 stages, which they express by the equations,
                                        =
         2KMn04       +   3MnS04 + 2H20   K2S04 + 2H2S04                                    +    5Mn02     ,

These       actions       take       place       at comparable                rates, and mathematical
formulae are given for them which accord very well                                      with the results
of experiment.
   The simplest           case to      consider is that in which both actions                                    are
unimolecular.             For a pure unimolecular reaction the expression                                        for
the velocity constant                 is,   as   given above,

To bring this into               a      form comparable                    with that of           the graded

constant      m.    If  m becomes infinitely          great, we have
                                     z=    A(l -e-«).
When        n —  m the above        expression for        z becomes         indeterminate,
but    if  we make the substitution in the differential                  equation,     we get
 on solving
                              z=   A(l-e-""-r/!<         a""").
     It  will be observed       that when both actions are unimolecular, the
 expression for z is symmetrical with respect                  to m and n.            So far,
 therefore, as the effect on z is concerned,                it is  a matter      of indiffer
 ence whether       the action with the velocity constant                  m or    that with
  the velocity constant n takes place first.
      A   characteristic   point of difference        between       reactions    proceeding
  in one stage and reactions proceeding in more than one is the
  following.      If  all the material is in the state           A   at the beginning of
  the   action,   then in the first case the maximum rate of increase
  of z takes place when z = 0, whilst in the second case this only occurs
  when z has attained a finite value.                Let   us consider       what happens
  with a reaction proceeding in two unimolecular                       stages.      The rate
  at  which x diminishes, viz.,           -       is greatest      at the beginning of
                                                                      dz
  the action ;    the rate at which           z increases,    viz., ^, is at that time
  zero.     We have then        a steady      diminution of      -       and   a steady   rise
  of         Now        =  - 3T - 37     :   so that y   will   increase at a gradually

    When      the actions   are reversible and         some of them other          than

     I  am indebted to my colleague,            Dr John M'Cowan, for             the solu
tions    of some special       cases where the integration can be performed                 ;
but, as they do not correspond to any cases hitherto                      realised,    and,
in addition,       show no special features different from those exhibited
by the two successive            unimolecular reactions,       I  refrain from giving
them here.
     In the example given           above of the transformation of ammonium
cyanate        into   urea,   the   processes    of electrolytic dissociation and
association       take place      so rapidly, compared        with the processes of
 urea-formation and decomposition, that they may                      be  neglected,      as
 far    as the     form of equation goes, for expressing               the rate     of the
 reaction.        By    a combination       of chemical and electrical measure
 ments      (Walker and Kay, Jour.              Chem.   Soc,     1897,     489) we can
  determine      at any moment the value of x + y and of y, and                     so can
  ascertain     the value of n, an equilibrium             experiment having pre
  viously given the ratio of n' to n.
      It should     be noted that we cannot, strictly speaking,              compare the
  values of n and        ri in  the   above   equation for urea-formation, since
  they are       of different dimensions, their ratio being altered by                     a
  change     in the unit of volume.            In  general    we can only compare
   together the constants         of reactions of the same order,            as  reactions
   of  different orders depend on the volume in different ways.                        This
   observation suggests a possible          method for ascertaining the rate of
   very rapid reactions otherwise inaccessible.               For   instance,     it would
   be   of great interest to determine the rate of any case of electrolytic
   dissociation     or association,      but the rapidity      with which these re
   actions     proceed     precludes      any direct   measurement.            Suppose     a
   graded      action could be found in which               the first stage was the
    union of     two ions to form          an undissociated        molecule       and the
    second    stage a comparatively          slow transformation         of the      undis
    sociated    molecule into something else.             Here we should have               a
    very   rapid bimolecular         reaction followed        by a measurable           uni
    molecular      reaction.      In solutions of ordinary concentrations                the
    rate of the      total transformation would be that of the pure uni
    molecular      reaction;     but,  if  we could    follow      the   course      of the
     graded   action in extremely dilute solution, we might be able to
     discover a disturbing effect of the preliminary bimolecular reaction,
     and ascertain     thereby approximately its rate.             This    is so, because

 32        Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinburgh.              [szss.
the proportion of the time taken to transform a given          proportion
of the total number of molecules        is in a unimolecular      reaction
independent of the volume,       whilst   in  a bimolecular    reaction    it
varies  inversely  as   the volume.     By dilution, then, we       should
greatly diminish    the actual   rate of   the bimolecular    reaction    as
compared   with that of the unimolecular      reaction,  and  its disturb
ing influence would      become   apparent.    Even   if it did   not,   we
should at least be able to assign an inferior limit to the rate of the
rapid reaction.   No   graded action of this   kind   has  hitherto   been
investigated, but  a  careful search may reveal one.

Preliminary              Note on a               Characteristic of               Certain
        Chemical            Reactions.           By     Prof. John              Gibson,
        Ph.D.
                                  (Read December 6, 1897.)
    In   a paper, communicated to the Society in February                      1897, the
author drew attention               to  increase   in electrical conductivity as           a
characteristic        of photo-chemical action.
     This     increase     in   electric conductivity        may be explained           by
 assuming         that light acts        either in    the    direction     of   increased
 conductivity, or as         a  disturbing agent on molecular systems              having
 an inherent tendency towards rearrangements involving                          increased
 conductivity.
     It  may be that both assumptions are correct.
     Since making this communication                 the author has been engaged
 ia experimental investigation, undertaken                 in order    to elucidate    this
 subject     further — more particularly in its chemical              aspect.
     The behaviour of nitric acid                with   respect    to   light appeared
 especially        suggestive.       Nitric acid    on   progressive      dilution with
  water becomes less and less subject to decomposition by light, until,
  as   that    dilution    which corresponds to maximum conductivity                      is
  approached, the action of light seems to                  cease   altogether,    so that
  nitric acid at        all dilutions     greater than that corresponding to its
  maximum           electrolytic     conductivity    appears    to   be   unaltered by
  light.       It    seemed,     therefore,     desirable to      investigate      experi
  mentally       the purely       chemical behaviour of nitric, hydrochloric,
  and    sulphuric acids at different degrees of dilution                    with water.
  The investigation is now sufficiently               far advanced to justify the
  communication          to the Society, in this preliminary              note, of some
  of the    conclusions which have been arrived at.
      It would       appear    that the chemical behaviour of the acids just
  mentioned depends,           in many of their reactions,          on whether their
   concentration is above           or below that corresponding to their maxi
   mum    electrolytic conductivity.

     The de-hydration           hy hydrochloric           acid of hydrated cobaltom

  immediately produced on adding                 a  few drops of the pink solution
  of the hydrated salt         to   an excess of hydrochloric              acid solution of
  28 per cent.        HC1 and upwards.              With     acid   of 24 per cent, the
 blue    coloration is still distinct.            With acid of 22 per cent, it is
 very slight.         With   acids below       IS   per cent, it is imperceptible.

 raised momentarily to the boiling                 point, proper precaution being
 taken     to    avoid local       over-heating,        a  dee])   brown      coloration     is
 rapidly produced.           Solutions      of    30 per cent.        II.,S04 and lower,
 treated      in the same manner,             either remain colourless,              or only
 slowly acquire        a faint yellow tinge.
    Reduction of chromic anhydride by hydrochloric acid. — Concen
 trated solutions of this acid rapidly reduce chromic anhydride at
 ordinary temperature,           the orange red colour of chromic anhydride
giving place to the pure green colour of solutions characteristic of
chromic chloride within             a few hours.          As   the dilution of the acid
is increased        towards maximum conductivity,                  the velocity of this
reaction diminishes.             In   one experiment with             24 per cent,       acid,
the reduction was complete               in about 100 hours         ;   while in another
experiment with 18 per cent, acid, which was begun on                               July   22,
 1897, the reduction is          still incomplete, in       spite of the fact that the
test-tube       was only loosely closed           by an ordinary cork, the lower
end of which has been bleached                by the escaping chlorine             gas.

ten seconds.                     With   36 per cent,        the time           required was about 4
minutes, and                  with    30*5 per cent, acid, 15-20 minutes.
     Oxidationof nitric oxide by nitric acid. — Passing nitric oxide
into nitric acid of 36 per cent., the blue colour of nitrous acid
rapidly                made      its appearance,      while nitric acid            of 28 per              cent,
remained colourless.
     These examples are sufficient to indicate the nature of the reasons
for assuming                  an increase      in electrolytic conductivity                 as a common
characteristic                   of all these reactions.             Whenever        the dilution              of
the    acid is carried beyond that corresponding to maximum con
ductivity, the velocity of the reaction is reduced to                                   a   minimum, or,
as    in              the case    of sulphuric acid and cane sugar, the velocity of
reaction in an opposite                     direction becomes the greater.                        It will      be
iHmembered that dilute sulphuric                            acid     so   far from de-hydrating or
charring                 sugar, adds water on to             it,   or hydrolises it.
      It      may be pointed out here as highly significant that those salts
^hich are markedly                       deliquescent are also those whose                        saturated

to the ionisation.      Only   so long as a marked increase of   conductivity
results from the dilution of the        acid brought about by the reaction
is the velocity of reaction considerable.
   As    soon as further    dilution, although it may increase     ionisation,
ceases to involve       marked increase in conductivity, the velocity        of
these reactions      rapidly   diminishes.     In  other words, the velocity
of the reaction is proportional to the rate of increase in the number
of carriers of electricity per unit volume.
    One class of reactions may be referred to here, because of their
general     importance, and because          they seem to present      special
difficulties from the point of view taken in this paper.
    When       metals   combine directly        with oxygen, metallic      con
 ductivity is lost, and the oxides fonned are themselves poor con
 ductors, and are frequently insoluble in water.
    A   closer  consideration of the facts shows,        however, that solid
 metals    do not readily combine       with  pure   oxygen.   Even metallic
 potassium throughout a wide range of temperature does not com
 bine directly with pure dry oxygen, and may, in fact, be distilled
 unchanged in it.       The means taken to induce combination, namely,
 to apply heat, tends in the first place to diminish the metallic con
 ductivity,    and secondly to increase         the vapour   pressure   of the
 metal.     It seems   more than probable that the chemical union takes
 place    between gaseous        oxygen    and gaseous,    not solid,   metal.
 But metallic vapours       are dielectrics.
    The following is     a  preliminary list of reactions which the author
 has been led to consider tentatively as characterised by increase of
 electrolytic conductivity       : —
    (a) Photo-chemical reactions generally.
    (b) Beactions characteristic of concentrated solutions of acids
                and bases.

      The following proposition has been found useful             as a  working
 hypothesis.        It is stated here for this reason.
      The degradation of potential chemical energy is generally associ
 ated    with molecular rearrangement involving diminished electrical
 resistance.      Decrease    of electrical resistance may result either from      :
      (a) Increased electrolytic conductivity.
      (h) Increased metallic conductivity.
      In  the case of non-conducting         substances  (dielectrics), increase
  of specific   inductive capacity is regarded as equivalent to decrease
  of electric   resistance.
       A loss in any one of these        properties may be compensated         by
  it  gain in one or both the others.
       A  paper    giving    full details will shortly     be  laid  before   the
   Society.

Leakage from Electrified Metal Plates and Points placed
      above and below Uninsulated Flames.                            By The Right
      Hon. Lord Kelvin, G.C.V.O., F.K.S., and Dr Magnus
      Maclean.
                                 (Read  July  5, 1897.)
   § 1.  In  § 10    of our paper " On Electrical Properties of Fumes
proceeding from Flames and Burning                  Charcoal," communicated to
this Society on 5th April, results of observations on the leakage
between     two parallel       metal plates with an            initial difference of
electric potential of 6-2 volts between             them,    when the fumes from
flames and burnings were allowed to pass between                    them and round
them,    were    given.      The   first part (§§ 1-4) of the present short
paper gives results of observations on the leakage between two
copper    plates   1  centimetre apart, when one of them is kept at a
constant high positive or negative potential                ;  and the other, after
being metallically connected            with the      electrometer-sheath,      is dis
connected,     and left to receive        electricity through fumes between
the two.
    The method of observation             (see   fig. 1) was as follows       : — Two
copper plates were fixed in a block of paraffin               at the top of a round
tinned iron funnel 96 centimetres            long and 15'6 centimetres internal
 diameter.      A   spirit-lamp or a Bunsen burner, the only two flames
 used  in these experiments, was placed at the bottom of the funnel, 86
 centimetres    below the two copper plates.             One terminal of a voltaic
 battery was connected to one plate, B, and the other terminal was
 connected     to the sheath of a Kelvin quadrant electrometer.                     The
 other copper plate was connected            to one of the pair of quadrants of
 the electrometer      in such    a  way that by pulling a silk cord with              a
 hinged platinum wire at its end, this copper plate and this pair of
 quadrants could be insulated from the sheath of the electrometer
 and the rest of the apparatus.            On doing so with no flame at the
 bottom of the funnel, no deflection from metallic zero was observed,
 even when the other plate was kept at the potential of 94 volts by
 the voltaic battery       ;  this being the highest we have as yet tried.

 1897-98.]        Leakage from Electrified Metal Plates.
Wheu the plate was kept at potentials of          2, 4   ...   10 volts, the
deflection    from metallic zero in three minutes was observed          ; but
for higher potentials, merely the times of attaining to 300 scale
divisions from metallic zero were observed.

     § 2. The results obtained are summarised       in the following table.
  In every     case for potentials below 90 volts there        was   greater
  leakage  when the uninsulated    plate was connected     to the negative
  terminal  of the battery.     This  difference  depended,     partially  at
  all events,   on the character of the     inner surface   of the funnel,
  which was old tarnished tin-plating.

 of   hot fumes from flames was well known                                 at that time, but               it        was
 surprising to find that cold air flowing up towards the flame                                                       did

 ton's communication to the British Association (1889, Report, pp. 225, 227)
 " on the Discharge of Electrification by Flames " : — " The observation seems to
 have been made by Priestley, that the discharge takes place with apparently
 equal rapidity, if the rod be held at the side of, or even below, the flame at
 the distance of, say, five centimetres."        The four words which wc have
 italicised are not verified with the forms and arrangements which we have
 used, as we find enormously greater leakage five centimetres above a flame
 than five centimetres below it ; but it is very interesting to learn that Priestley
 had found any leakage at all through air five centimetres below a flame.

 steel wire 43 centimetres long was fixed to the insulated terminal
of the multicellular electrometer,             with its point vertically        below an
ordinary gas-burner,         as  shown in fig.       2.
    § 6.   By means of       a small carrier metal          plate (a Coulomb's proof
plane) a positive or negative charge was given to this wire and the
quadrants of the multicellular till the reading on the scale was 240
volts.       The   leakage was then observed            (a) with gas not lit, (h) with
gas    lit at different vertical      distances      above the point of the wire.
We found that          there   was rapid leakage           when the flame was one
centimetre above the wire           ;  and the times of leakage from 240 volts
to about        100 volts increased        as  the flame was raised to greater
distances        above   the    point   ;  or,    otherwise,     the   rate   of fall      of
potential in one minute from 240 volts diminished                       as the   distance
 of the      flame above the point was increased.                  AVhen    the vertical
 distance      of the flame above the point was 15 centimetres,                  or more,
 the time of leakage         from 240 volts was practically the same                   as  if
 the flame was        not  lit at all.      A  plate     of metal, glass, paraffin, or
 mica, put between the point and the flame, diminished the rate of
 leakage.        The leakage from 200 volts during the first minute is
  given in the following         table, for different distances           of the flame,

   that  when the flame was three or four centimetres above the point,
   there   was     very rapid     discharge     ;   but when       the   flame    was     CO
   centimetres or more above          the point, the leakage          from 3500 volts
   was   practically the same      as  if the flame was not lit.

At   a    corner of each plate was pasted                         a   little square of tinfoil, so as

      We      hope to return to the investigation                with the insulation of
 the     electrometer      perfected      ; and to determine by special experi
 ment, how much of the fall of potential in the electrometer                        ia each
 case is due to the electricity of opposite                kind induced      on the upper
 most surface of the non-conducting plate, and how much,                          if any, is
 due to leakage through the air to the metal disc or point below.
      § 9. To test the quality of the electrification of both sides of the
 non-conducting plates of glass and paraffin, a thin copper sheet, C,
  was fixed to one of the terminals of                     a  quadrant electrometer,      as
  represented in fig. 4, where              A   is the plan of the plate C, and B
  is the plate of paraffin or glass under test.
       In the primary experiment             (fig. 3) the non-conducting plate was
  fixed in a horizontal position one centimetre above the electrified
  metal (point or disc), and eleven                  centimetres below the flame.         A
  charge was given to the metal, to raise its potential to about 3500

 volts.   After    some    minutes, generally      till the  potential of  the
 metal fell to 2000 volts, the non-conducting plate was removed            and
 placed, as shown in fig. 4, above the metal plate          C attached to  the

quadrant electrometer,       and the deflection was         observed.   For  a
thin  piece of glass (0'3 cm.    thick)   the whole effect of the two sides
was   negative    when the electrified metal point or disc had been
charged    positively and vice versd.        But   on putting   two plates  of
glass   above   the  electrified metal,     we  found the top plate to be
oppositely charged     ;  and the under plate to be charged similarly to
the point or disc,       but not so highly.        We found corresponding
results with a plate of paraffin 0-75 cm. thick, and with two plates
of paraffin, 0'5 cm. and 0-75 cm. thick.            When a plate of paraffin
3-25   cms.  thick   was used, we always found the top face charged
oppositely to the charge of the metal, whether disc or needle-point,
and the under face charged         similarly to the metal below.        Thus
the apparent total charge of the two faces of a thin non-conducting
plate is due to the fact that the face of the plate away from the
electrified metal is more highly charged            oppositely than the face
next the metal is charged similarly.

Observations on the Migratory Movements of Salmonidae
  during the Spawning Season. By W. L. Calderwood.
                                    (Read January 31, 1898.)
   The fact that the           salmon        comes from the sea and spawns in the
river    has induced the supposition                  that this fish ascends the river
only for       the purpose          of spawning.         That       the supposition is not
always justifiable           seems, however, sufficiently                 shown by the fact
that clean-run salmon with undeveloped reproductive organs may
be found in fresh water during the spawning season, and indeed at
any     season of the year, and also by the fact that a spring run of
fish is usuaL          "When    we regard            the head      waters       of many of our
rivers    as   localities for the natural propagation of the salmon, we
find, however, that, except at the spawning season, adult fish are
never present.          When, at the same time, we remark that the fish
which      ascend      to those         waters during the winter months are all
sexually ripe, we may fairly conclude that the fish are impelled to
migrate to those head waters for the express purpose of spawning.
   It   has been said that the              shads (Clupea allosa and C. finta) and
the     sea    lamprey       (Petromyzon         marinas) are examples of fishes
which      have    a spawning habit              analogous         to that of the salmon,
since they also ascend rivers for the purpose                         of propagating their
species.       Their habit          is,   however, more analogous                to that of the
comparatively few salmon which penetrate at once to head streams
and tributaries, than to the fishes which inhabit the lower reaches
of a    salmon      river.     They ascend for            a   limited period only, and
seek again the salt water whenever the operation of spawning                                  is
completed.        They are marine fishes which spawn in fresh water.
The     common      eel may be taken as an example of                       a   fresh water fish
which spawns in          sea water.
  We have         as   yet very little knowledge about the movements                          of
adult salmon in the           sea   :     we know that they are to be found many
miles from land, and we know that they congregate                                in great num
bers in the estuaries           of rivers, presumably the particular                      rivers
from which        they have             originally    come    to    the     sea;   that in the

48           Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                   [sess.
estuaries  they move to and fro with the flood and ebb tides               ;   that
with the   ebb they seek the shallower waters at the margins of                 the
estuaries,  where they are taken in the nets             ;  but we need to turn
to our knowledge of the salmon in fresh water, and the time                       it
remains there, in order to form an estimate                 of how long the fish
spends   in salt  water.     It  seems to me that, even          by this process,
a  very uncertain margin is left, but that in all probability a fish             of
full adult growth,     say a fish of four years        old, has spent an equal
period of time in fresh and in salt water.
    It is further noticed that         a   run of fish commences       when the
river is swollen, or during a spring tide.             At such times estuarine
netting is reported as at its best.
    In the  same way, a flood       in   a particular  tributary is believed to
induce a run of fish, either during the flood or as the water is
falling after the highest of the freshet is past.             If we accept   in its
entirety the theory that salmon return to the particular river where
they were spawned, we must necessarily believe that the fish which
take advantage of such a flood are some of those that were spawned
in the particular tributary ; yet proof is easily found that salmon
will take advantage of newly accessible spawning grounds, and that
such fluctuations take place in the conditions of the various tribu
taries  of  a large  river as to point to the conclusion that salmon,
when once in the main river of their birth, enter the particular
tributaries which are instinctively           known to be suitable, or which
present suitable conditions for ascent at the proper time.                 What
these conditions are seem less known              to man than to the salmon,
yet not infrequently       fish pass favourite        spawning grounds, and,
impelled it    seems by the instinct          for ascent, travel on to ground
where the ova have certainly much less chance of hatching out in
numbers.
   Last winter    I was fortunate         enough to have the opportunity of
procuring data from the head waters of Tweed which, although not
perfect enough to afford         answers      to all the questions which       sur
round the spawning of migratory Salmonida?,                give us, nevertheless,
some information      of a more definite kind than can be commonly
procured, and which           on   this     account are,    I  think, worthy     of
mention.      During   the    entire spawning season daily records were
taken by three watchers        as  to number of fish seen, their position,
the state of the water, etc.

     The       Talla is a comparatively small stream                          about     6    miles in
length,        which joins the Tweed                    at Tweedsmuir.           Ascending the
main river          it    is, however, the last tributary                  of importance.             Ita
drainage area is 6180 acres, being one-fourth of the drainage area
of the         Tweed       above    Talla-mouth.            The observations            as    to state
of the water are distinguished                     under the headings                of "normal,"
"
     f
   flood," " J-flood," " £ and full flood." In recording fish, salmon
and sea trout are alone mentioned,       no distinction being drawn
between salmon and grilse.                   In all probability,           however,         few grilse
reach these           head    waters, situated as they are, 90 miles                         from the
sea,      and visited by late-running fish only at the spawning season.
     Except         when the stream              was     in full flood         no difficulty         was
experienced           in counting the fish, since the channel is beautifully
clean, and the stream comparatively small.                               Even in half-flood the
water was, as a rule, only slightly coloured.                            In counting,        however,
it   i3   quite certain that in many instances the same fish was recorded
twice         or three times        over.        This     could not be avoided by the
watchers,          and    in dealing with the returns                I   have thought         it   better
not to attempt any separation.
     Fish were           recorded   as   in Talla "Water from 4th November 1896
to 16th           February     1897, that        is,    during   a   period of 105 days, but
fish were not observed,                  and were not present, on every individual
day.          The     state    of the water during               those         105 days            was as

       I   may remark, in passing, that from 21st                            Jan. to 9th Feb., a
 period of nineteen days, no fish were                            observed in Talla Water,
 and that during               this time the water was in its normal condition,
 but that during eight days of the time the margins of the stream
  were covered by ice and snow.
       Deducting        the 47 days, therefore,              we have 58 days out of                the
  105 during which fish were noticed in the river.
       The total number of fish recorded is 320, there being 172 salmon
  and 148        sea  trout.

    Isolating    together    the state      of    water and the totals             as   to
numbers of fish, we find that —
               During    40 normal days, there were 178 fish.

    This result     shows the greatest        ascent    of fish while the river is
in quarter-flood, there being then              9 fish  a day, as compared           with
7§ fish a day during half-flood, and scarcely 4 J fish a clay during
normal flow. The result as to full flood is necessarily of small
 value, since, during a flood of full force,             observations         are impos
sible.     Reference to the table will show,              however,         that the two
 highest    totals, viz., 26 fish and 25 fish (9th and 10th                  Dec.) occur
 during normal flow       ;  but this normal flow succeeds three days of
 quarter-flood, during which we may presume the fish were working
 up the main river.         No marked      rise in the number of fish recorded
 is noticeable during any prolonged period of normal flow, yet it is
  evident, by the figures which occur between two rises of the water,
  that with only the average flow (1 2,000,000 gals, in twenty-four hours)
  both salmon and sea trout had no difficulty in entering the stream.
  Only    one other point may be noticed before                leaving this subject.
  A period of normal flow      existed for thirty-two consecutive              days from
  9th Jan. to 9th Feb.        During the nine first days fish occurred, but
  a  gradual diminution in number is noticeable.                  From 20 th Jan. to
  10th Feb. no fish are recorded, then immediately, with                        a rise   to
  half-flood, we have the three last records of salmon in Talla.
      From   a  consideration of these data, therefore,            it seems allowable
  to   infer that   the condition       of water-flow preferred            by fish  when
  ascending from a main river to               a  tributary,     for the purpose         of
  spawning, is a moderate            rise rather than         a flood    ;   and   that   a
  succession     of moderate      rises   would fulfil       the    conditions      under
   which most fish would be enabled                to reach     the upper spawning
  grounds of a large river such             as   the Tweed.         Further, it seems
  clear that fish ascend in limited numbers when the water is in its
   normal condition.
      A  record   of water temperatures          of Tweed and of Talla was also

52               Proceedings          of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
kept.      The readings              were    not taken with any precise accuracy,
degrees only being given.                    It   may, perhaps,     be of interest to note
that during at least the months of January and February the tem
perature of Talla Water                    seems to be higher        than that of Tweed.
The same thermometer was used in both cases, the observer walking
from one stream to the other, yet, as a rule, the water of Talla is
recorded     as the higher by 2°.                  Only on one occasion do               I   find the
reverse    to be the case, the readings being,                      Tweed 40*, Talla 39*
(14th Feb.).   The few instances of the readings being the same
occur chiefly when the air temperature is at or below freezing point.
  In no         case,    when         comparing        temperatures         with     records      of
ascending       fish, do    I   find evidence which leads me to suppose that
particular       fluctuations of temperature               have     any effect upon the
movements         of the fish.             This negative result       is,
                                                                       I        think, of some
interest, since the effect of                a   change of temperature          in   a   tributary,
as compared        to   a   main stream, has been considered by some as of
great importance.
  The following          is     a   record       of the temperatures,           which may be

     If,   now, we      compare       the salmon and              sea   trout columns of the
above       table (p. 4), we find that, of 320 fish, 172 were salmon and
148 sea      trout.      The 58 days' observations                 shown in the table begin
and end      with      records of salmon, which are, however, noted on only
47 days      of this period.              The arrival of the            sea   trout   is    later by   6
days,      being on 16th Nov.              Their      disappearance,          on the other hand,
is   earlier     by    8     days,    being      on      13th Jan.         They are reecrd.-d
on     36 days   ;     and    both species together                are recorded       on 25 days.
During the four weeks (32 days) from 8th Dec. to 8th Jan. the
figures become higher than at any other time during the season.
Not only the greatest number of fish, but the heaviest fish appeared
at this time.
     It   may be remarked, however,                   that the majority of the               sea   trout
arrived      before     the largest        runs of salmon, for             if   we compare           the
first 16 days of this period                with      the second 16 days, we find that
the totals are as follows:            — In      the first 16 days, 104 sea                  trout and
¦i'2 salmon      ;   in the second        16 days,        80 salmon and         8   sea    trout.
     The very great amount of poaching which                               is   practised      almost
openly in Tweedsmuir district makes                          it   impossible to say how long
kelts remain          after spawning.               As   a   matter of fact,    I     believe very
few fish are         allowed time even to deposit                 a   limited number of their
ova.        On one of my visits to the district, an old and experienced
poacher        expressed       the    opinion         that not more than               one    fish     in
twenty escapes the leister.
     Turning now to the consideration of the river Tweed, in the
neighbourhood           of Tweedsmuir, particulars were collected similar to
those      described       for Talla AVater.              The part of the river Tweed
under observation was about                     six miles in length, viz., from Stan
hope up past           Talla-mouth to Tweedhope.                      As   compared         with the
3'20     fish in Talla, the total number of fish in this part of Tweed
during       the same time was 684, being 512 salmon                                  and    172 sea
trout.
     The majority of those                fish were noticed in Tweed below Talla
in   4   miles   of water.           In   the   2   miles above Talla only 59 fish in
all were counted.
     As might be expected, the order in which the fish arrived, and
the relative         numbers,    bear     a   more or less close resemblance                   to the

    The largest runs of       sea  trout occur at an earlier date than the
largest runs of salmon, and the figures showing this are opposite
dates a little earlier than the dates of the largest runs in Talla.
This     gives us, then, a natural preliminary condition to that                already
described.        We   have the fish increasing        in numbers,    first in Tweed,
then we find them in Talla.

     As also was the case in Talla, the heaviest                 fish were observed
 when the greatest          number were recorded.              Till  the   sixth week
 very     few salmon      over 12 lbs. in weight were               noticed;     on   the
 8th Jan., however, heavy              fish    appeared     in   numbers,      and    the
 figure, 201, which        represents     the   total number of salmon           during
 the sixth fortnight, is made up of 152 fish, estimated                     as of more
 than     12 lbs.  weight.
      Turning now to the number and position of salmon and                     sea  trout
 redds, we find that the total for the area under consideration is
 71, 11 being        in Talla and 60 in Tweed.              The majority of redds
 were noticed only after          the   fish had moved        away, or been taken
  away by poachers, but on 24 of them                fish were seen in the act of
  spawning.        Of  the fish on these redds, 16 were salmon and 8 were
  sea   trout.
      I  have the dates of the 24 redds, but with such a small number
  out of 71 we can hardly draw any very reliable conclusions.                         The
  first salmon      redd   6eems    to have been noticed on 20th Nov. in
  Talla. the      last  on   15th    Feb. in      Tweed.       The     first sea trout

1897-98.]            Migratory Movements of SalmonicUe.                            55
redd was        on    26th   Nov.    far up Talla,      the  last on    13th Dec,
i.e.,   two months        earlier than the last salmon redd.             We      have
already noticed, however, that after this date very few sea trout
were present        in  the river.     With    the exception     of the first date
mentioned        for   sea trout,    the  other redds      made   hy this species
were noticed on 12th and 13th                 Dec.      This indeed marks         the
height of the sea trout period in Tweedsmuir for 1896, the salmon
being recorded as spawning during a much more extended                      period.
    The total number of fish counted in the area under consideration
was 1004, or 502 pairs.            It  may be matter of remark that, with           so
many fish in the water,             there should have been only           71   redds.
It   should be recollected first, however, that amongst              the thousand
and four fish are very many enumerated                 more   than once, whereas
 the 71 is the actual number of redds               present in the river so far as
 the watchers could ascertain.             To determine      the difference    in size
 between a salmon and a sea trout redd, 20 redds of the former and
  10 of the    latter were measured.          The average length of the salmon
 redd,    measuring from the upper end of the trough to the centre of
  the   tail gravel thrown up below, was found to be              4 feet 6   in., and
  the breadth      about   3 feet.    The   sea  trout redd averaged 30 inches
  long hy    about 20 inches broad.
      I believe    I am   correct in saying that every adult fish seen in tho
   district was     a fish  in spawning condition, that          no unripe fish is
  ever   found so high up the river, and           I believe   that the difference
   between    the 71 redds and the 502 pairs of fish is almost               entirely
  accounted      for by the diligent     practice of local and other poachers.

Note on the Action of Hydroxylamine Hydrochlorate.
       By W. Brodie Brodie, M.B., CM., Physiological Laboratory,
       University, Glasgow.        {Communicated by Dr M'Kendrick.)
                             (Read February 7, 1898.)
    Hydroxylamine,      NH2OH (oxyammonia), is          an unstable substance
only to be had in weak solutions.              It forms many salts, two        of
which,     the sulphate, 2(NH2OH.)H2S04, and the hydrochloride,
NH2OH.HCl, are to be found in             commerce.
    My attention was first directed       to this substance, hydroxylamine,
by seeing a reference        to the work     of Loew and Bokorny on the
chemical constitution of protoplasm, and to their theory that there
is present in it a group of atoms of the nature of an aldehyde.               To
this group of atoms they attribute the energy of living protoplasm,
and state, in support of this, that hydroxylamine,             which is said to
have    a strong affinity      for aldehyde, rapidly kills protoplasm in
algae and the young shoots of plants.
    My intention     was to use both hydroxylamine           and its salts upon
some forms of animal protoplasm, but so far the hydrochlorate is
the only preparation that has been available.               This salt is easily
soluble in water and is extremely acid.            It is difficult to neutralise
it exactly,   as at a certain point    it reacts to both red and blue litmus
simultaneously.        Solutions of   1   per cent, strength were employed
almost entirely.
    Ciliated epithelium, scraped from the mouths of frogs, was
examined in -75 per cent, salt solution, and a drop of the solution of
the hydroxylamine        salt was then run in.         In   a minute or so the
ciliary movements       became somewhat slower and continued to be so
until they finally    ceased.    At the   same time, the cell-body gradually
cleared up, and the nucleus came more prominently into view.
    Ciliated   epithelial   cells,  from    the gills   of mussels,     behaved
exactly in the same way.
    Nerve-muscle      preparations     gave   negative results, both       when
irrigated for   a  long time with the fluid, and when the solution had

  1897-98.]     W. B. Brodie on Hydroxylamine Hydrochlomte.                          57
 been previously        injected into a pithed frog.           If   a  crystal of the
 salt, however,      were laid upon the muscle, its power of contraction
 diminished      rapidly,   and disappeared       in about five or six minutes.
    Frogs' hearts showed the most marked results.                    About   a  minute
after the solution was first applied, the              frequency of the beats was
distinctly less, and this was followed very shortly by diminution                     in
the amount        of contraction.      Both the frequency and amount of the
contractions       continued    to fall    until the heart       ceased beating     en
tirely.     Usually the auricles continued to beat for             a  short time after
the ventricle      had ceased.
    In   the case      of the heart      and     nerve    muscle    preparations    the
muscle     substance,     after the application of the solution, was soft and
 gelatinous and        very pale in colour,        especially    in  the case    of the
 heart.
    It  seems    clear that this salt of hydroxylamine acts             as a poison   to
 protoplasmic structures, but how            it  acts is not explained.       Nothing
 at present can       be said regarding the aldehyde theory.                It  seemed
 possible    to me,      however, that its action might be due to some
 reducing      or deoxidising      action.      Hydroxylamine        is said   to be a
 powerful reducing          agent,  and    the    solution of the       hydrochlorate
  certainly reduces a solution of chloride of silver in ammonia.
     Its action    on blood-pigment is      somewhat       peculiar, and is the same
  whether     the   pigment be treated         with    a neutralised solution or a
  crystal   of the salt, which is acid.       The two dark bands of oxyhemo
 globin     gradually fade and broaden            out,  but never absolutely dis
  appear,   whilst the part of the spectrum,             from the commencement
  of the green     to the violet, is darkened.         It  resembles    the spectrum
  of alkaline     haematin, with the addition of these two faint bands.
  The single     band of reduced haemoglobin is never             seen.

Notes on some Additional Fossils collected at Seymour
      Island, Graham's Land, by Dr Donald and Captain
      Larson. By George Sharman, Esq., and E. T. Newton,
      F.K.S.       {Communicated by Sir Archibald Geikik, F.R.S.)
      (With     a Plate.)
                              (Read February 7, 1898.)
    Dr Donald, who sailed         on board the    " Active " in the voyage of
1892-3, has given a short account of the discovery of a number of
fossils by Captain Larsen on Seymour Island, to the north of Snow
Hill, in January         1893     (Geographical     Journal,  vol.   ii.   p. 438,
1893) . Some of these fossils were sent to Professor James Geikie,
and at his request we gave an account of them to the Royal Society
of Edinburgh, June         4, 1894    (Trans.   Roy. Soc. Edin., vol. xxxvii.
p.   707;  see    also Dr Murray,       Geog.  Journ., vol. iii.   p.    11, note,
 1894) .   The fossils do not appear           to have been found in situ.
Captain Larsen reports of the locality
                                                  " that he found no traces of
vegetation     there, the    surface   being formed of volcanic dehris and
                                "
numbers of these fossils           (Dr Donald's notice,   p. 438, loc. cit.).
    The condition of the fossils,         however, would seem to indicate
that the mother rock from which              they were derived could not be
at any great distance from the spot where they were picked up.
    As the few        species   of Mollusca     represented    by these      fossils
seemed to us to find their nearest allies among Lower Tertiary forms,
 and to be near to certain species known from Patagonia (Darwin,
 Geol. Obs. Sth. Am., 1846), we were led to conclude that these new
 discoveries    indicated the occurrence         of Lower Tertiary        rocks in
 Seymour Island.
    Two of    the fossils examined by us were sufficiently distinct from
 known species to justify their receiving new specific names.                   One
 of these was a large         Cucullwa     resembling    Cucullma alta, Sow.,
 from tertiary beds of Santa Cruz, and C. decussata, Sow., from the
 Lower Eocene of Britain, but, as it differed in certain points, it has
 been named       C. Donaldi.
    The second new form, called by us Cytherea antardica, has some

resemblance           to the C. orbicularis,     Edw., from the Lower Eocene of
Britain, and the           C. bellovacina,     Desh., from the Sables              inferieurs
of France.
      Besides       these   two shells we were          able,       with some doubt, to
identify generically           a Crassatella (?),      Donax (I), and          a  Natira   (I).
With        these shells we also received fragments of fossilised wood,
¦which proved to be coniferous, and there is no reason for thinking
that they        are of different       age from the fossils, as similar wood is
commonly found in              eocene deposits.
      In   1893-4, Captain C. A. Larsen again sailed                       to the Antarctic
 regions (Geographical Journal, 1894, vol. iv. p.                          333), and on the
 ISth of        November 1893          landed at about the middle of Seymour
 Island.          He    says :
                                 " The land is hilly          and intersected by deep
  valleys     ; some     of the hills are conical and consist                of sand, small-
  gravel, and cement; here and there is some petrified wood."
  " When we were a quarter of a Norwegian mile from shore, and
  stood about 300 feet above                 the  sea,    the petrified wood          became
   more and more frequent, and we took several                            specimens     which
   looked as       if they  were of deciduous trees           ;  the bark and branches,
   as also the year rings, were seen on the logs which lay slantingly in
                     Captain Larsen also speaks of " petrified worms
    the soil."                                                                         " with
    this wood, and these appear to be the filled-in borings in the wood,
    which we believe to have been made by Teredo.                         Several specimens
    of this wood, in the          same condition       as   that previously described,
    have now reached us through               Dr Murray, who,             at the same time,
    sent another fossil shell which had been obtained on the previous
    voyage,      on which       is written     "Graham's           Land,     3.12.92.     Cap.
    Seymour."          This  specimen      is of interest as adding another genus
    and species to the list of fossils from these inhospitable Antarctic
    regions.       Neither the hinge- teeth nor the pallial line can be seen,
    and we have,         with  some hesitation, therefore,            referred this fossil to
     the genus       Cyprina.      Enough of the original shell remains to show
     its characters and the internal cast, which is almost perfect, gives
     evidence     of the form of the entire shell           ;   this, when perfect, must
     have been 3 inches long, 2-5 inches high, and                  1 "75  inch thick.     The
     shell is regularly oval and nearly equilateral                 ;  the umbones,     which
     are  large,     are  nearly central, with        only the slightest inclination
     forwards    ;   there has been a strong external ligament.                      Although

60                  Proceedings              of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                                  [sess.
much denuded,                     it is evident that           the exterior was marked by                        lines
of growth, which                       are much stronger                 at regular intervals of             about
\   inch, giving              a    ringed appearance                 to the shell.           Below some             of
these lines, especially                     towards the margin, the surface is puckered
by vertical ridges, which give the shell an indistinct                                      frilled appear
ance,        like that seen on some examples                                    of C.   planata from the
Thanet         Sands.              The almost              equilateral form and nearly central
umbones         serve to distinguish                       this fossil from any shell which has
been referred                 to the genus            Cyprina        ;    and the form which comes
nearest to          it    is one from Navidad,                    Chili,        described    by Sowerby             in
Darwin's Geological Obtervai 'ions in South America (1846, p. 250,
PI.    II.   fig.    11)          as    Corbis       (?)   laevigata.          The original specimen               of
this species             is   preserved         in the Natural History Museum at South
Kensington, and has been compared                                        with     the present          fossil.      It
seems highly probable                       that the two shells may belong to the same
genus,        and         this,        as   we       think,     is   most        likely to        be    Cyprina.
Although            the       two shells are in many respects very similar, our
Antarctic           specimen             has less inflated umbones                  ;   its greatest thick
ness    is   about the middle of the valves,                                   and when complete             was a
rounder shell.                    In     C. laevigata the valves                  are more in dated,             and
this chiefly towards the umbonal region,                                        while   it   is   a    wider and
more         oval shell.                 These       differences          seem too great           for specific
identity, and, seeing how much we are indebted to Captain Larsen
for the preservation                     of these fossils,               we suggest      that his name be
associated with                it      and that      it    be called      Cyprina Larseni.
      The specimens of wood                          are very similar             to that noticed in our
previous paper, and sections prepared from some of them show that
they also are coniferous                    ;    indeed, there            is   no reason why they should
not all have been taken from one log.
      Examples of the matrix found attached                                        to the     outside of this
wood have also been received, and are found to be                                        a   calcareous          grit,
similar to that filling the mollusc shells, and                                    it   is   highly probable
that they come from the same formation.                                           Mr    J.

examined            this matrix, and says:                     "It        is   composed of angular frag
ments of quartz with                         minute particles of garnets, muscovite, and
other minerals, cemented by carbonate of lime."                                             Several pieces of
this wood have                     been      riddled          by some boring animal, probably
 Teredo, or an allied form                       ;    sometimes           the tubes are isolated,           but in

 large field of fossiliferous rocks as yet unexplored in the Antarctic
 regions, and it is of extreme         interest to find that in this distant
 southern area Lower Tertiary deposits             occur with forms of life so
 •very  similar to those with which we are familiar                  in our own

    Note on the Axes of Symmetry which are Crystal-
          lographically possible. By Hugh Marshall, D.Sc
                                    (Read January   17,   1898.)
     In    a
              " Memoire sur la deduction, d'un               seul principe, de tous lea
systemes          crystallographiques        avec    leurs subdivisions,"          by   Axel
Gadolin,*          there     is given a proof that,          if  we assume       the law of
rational indices, only digonal, trigonal, tetragonal,                      and hexagonal
axes are possible            with crystals.     This proof is        adopted   by Groth in
the last edition of his Physikalische                 Krystallographie,        1895.     The
proof which           I  shall now give, although somewhat similar in general
principle, is decidedly simpler than that of Gadolin.                        It is assumed
in    the    former that an axis of symmetry is necessarily                      a possible
edge or zone axis, and that there are possible edges perpendicular
to any axis of symmetry, i.e., that the                    plane to which it is normal
is a possible          face.     These general     propositions are not, so far as           I
am aware, to be found                  in text-books, although tacitly          assumed    in
certain cases, and a proof of them,                     as also      of two similar ones
concerning planes of symmetry, is therefore indicated here before
treating the main problem.
      1.   Every plane          of  symmetry    is a possible face. — Any face A,
inclined to the plane of symmetry S, gives by reflection in S a
similar face            A' lying     on  the  other side of S.            These two faces
necessarily          intersect in a line lying           in  S.     Similarly,    any other
face      B will       intersect its image        B     along another line lying            in
8.       Consequently, S is parallel to two possible edges, and is there
fore a possible face.
     2. The normal to every plane                  of symmetry is          a possible    zone
axis.    — Let OX          be any edge inclined         to the plane of symmetry S.
 Its reflection OX'            is a similar  edge.      The plane       XOX'    is therefore
a possible         face, and, from the symmetry,              it is perpendicular to        S.

Similarly, any other               edge     07      will, with its     image         OY', determine
a possible face                TOT',      also    normal to S.         S is therefore                  a zone
plane, being perpendicular to two possible faces, and its normal is
a possible zone axis.
     3. Every axis           of   symmetry        is normal to a possible face. — (a) Let
the axis          A    be    of   the second           (or any even) order.                  Any       face   B
inclined         to   A will,     on rotation round the axis through an angle ir,
give a similar              face B",       and these two faces necessarily                         intersect
along a line perpendicular to A.                            Similarly,       any other face C,
inclined to A,             has a corresponding face              C    opposite         it    and equally
inclined to A, and                these    two faces also intersect in                  a    line perpen
dicular to A.            Consequently,           a plane   parallel to these two edges, and
therefore perpendicular to A, is                         a possible    face.         (6)      If A        is an
axis of uneven order it must be at least of the third order, and any
edge       OB inclined to it              necessitates       at least two others,                     OB" and
OB", crystallographically                   identical with OB and equally inclined
to A.         If these      three edges are taken as axes of reference,                           it follows,
from the identity of the edges, that the axial ratios must be
6 = i' = fe* = l. The face 111 would therefore cut OB, OB', and
OB" at equal distances                    from     0 ; but such       a plane is evidently the
base       of a right regular n-sided                  pyramid, and the axis                 A    is normal
to   it.      A   is therefore normal to a possible face.
      Every axis of symmetry is a possible
     4.                                                               zone     axis. — (a) Let the
axis A be of the second (or any even) order.                            Any       edge       OB inclined
toA gives, by rotation through ir round the axis, a similar edge
CB" lying in the plane determined by A and OB.    Similarly, any
other edge            OC    necessitates         one   OCf symmetrical to              it,   lying in the
plane determined by                A   and OC.           But BOB1      and      COC          are possible
                                                                                     A A,
faces, being parallel to pairs of possible                      edges, and                   their mutual
intersection,          is  a   possible edge or zone axis,               (b)    If           is   of uneven
order,      it   must be at least of the third order.                       Any      face     B       inclined
to   it    necessitates        at least two others, B1 and B", crystallographically
identical with it.                These faces together form the sides of                          a    regular
n    sided pyramid, whose base, perpendicular                          to    A,   is   also       a   possible
 face,      so that        the basal       edges       are possible    zone axes.                 There       is,
 therefore,       a    whole series of pyramids, having the same base                                   as the
 first, whose sides are also                     possible faces,      such      as     C,     C,      and 0".
 The corresponding edges of two such pyramids determine                                               a   set of

 to a regular     w-sided   pyramid.       The   plane    passing     through two
alternate pyramidal edges, as         CB    and    CB", will also     be a possible
face,   and   must therefore        have   rational   indices on the axes of
reference.      As it  passes through       the   two points C and          B it     can
have a rational       index on      the   remaining axis only          if  the     ratio
OD;OB" is rational, OD being the parameter of BCB" on the axis
OB".      But OB=OBl,          therefore    ODjOB must         be rational;        since
                                                                             lit

BB"    is perpendicular to OB",       ODjOB     is cos  BOB',    i.e., cos       .
    The law of rational indices, therefore,          limits the value of n to
those cases where cos       —    is rational.    Further, from the nature of
an axis of symmetry,        n must be a whole number.              It   is shown by
 X. Boudaief, in     an appendix to Gadolin's paper, that the only values
of n which satisfy these        two conditions are        2,  3, 4, and 6.         Con
 sequently,    only digonal, trigonal, tetragonal,       and hexagonal        axes of
 symmetry are possible        with  crystals.
     The construction employed         above is possible     only when n is not
 less than 3.     That digonal      axes are possible      follows at once, how
 ever, from    the possibility of tetragonal       and hexagonal       axes, so that
  the case  of n = 2 does not require to be specially considered.

        Regions, by Sir Archibald Geikie, F.R.S. With Petro-

                               (Read February 7, 1898.)
     Towards the end of the year 1893,                I  received     from      Captain
 Thomas Robertson of Dundee, master of the steamship                     " Active,"     a
 number of specimens             of rocks which        he   had collected in the
 Antarctic regions during         a sealing    expedition.      In  letters to me he
 gave the following particulars regarding these specimens: — "They
 were    all taken    from one place in Dundee Island.                  We had       not
 time to land and take specimens           from other parts.         Dundee Island,
 so named      by    me,  is a separate      piece of land,      close   to   Joinville
 Island, and all the stones        I sent you were       picked up on       a beach at
 its south-west     end.     I  had a boat sealing      on   Joinville Island,       but
 they brought no specimens of rock on board.                  The round Hat piece
 of light-coloured granite         I broke off      a piece   the size of a mail's
head, the day       I sent off the box to you.           The small piece of blue
basaltic rock     I  broke off at the same time, not to make the box                 too
heavy.       You   have all the others       as   they were found.         The south
 west   end   of Dundee Island is          a   long low point which           I  named
 '
    Welchness.'      There are high cliffs up from the ness, from which
the pieces of granite          could have come, or they might have been
 carried    by the ice.
     "When going through 'Active Sound'                   I  saw on the opposite
 shore, on the top of a high glacier,           a number of large pieces of the
red granite,    and about five miles farther along the same shore there
are steep basaltic cliffs.        Close to the east end of Dundee Island
there is a small island, named           by Captain Ross Paulet Island, the
peak of which is an extinct volcano."
     The specimens       sent    by Captain Robertson had not the usual
rounded and smoothed character of beach stones, but it was impos
sible to tell whether they had been derived from some neighbour
ing rock in tritit, or had been borne from some distance.                          The

  1897-9S.]           Rocks   from    the Antarctic Regions.                     07
 granites and veLn-quartz        may indicate the existence        of these rocks
in Dandee Island.           There was    a piece   of tuff which was probably
carried from        some    other islet or coast-line.       One of the       most
interesting of the specimens was a smoothed pebble of red                   jasper.
On wetting it and examining it with a lens, I detected                        what
appeared      to be traces of Rculiolaria.          The specimen      was accord
ingly submitted        to Dr G.    J.  Hind, F.R.S., who      was so good as to
supply the following description of it : —
    "In thin sections of the stone the radiolaria                appear   as  clear
translucent      bodies,   of circular or elliptical       outlines,   ranging in
diameter from         "11  mm.    to "33 mm.         As  a  rule, no structural
characters      are preserved,     and,   when    magnified, the      margins of
these bodies are seen to be only indefinitely marked off from the
 reddish cloudy matrix. In some instances, however, the margins
 are dentate or with short projecting spines, and occasionally there
 are traces of a wall with        alternate   light spaces in it representing
 the perforations       in the test.     Most of the forms appear to have
 been simple spheroids or ellipsoids with a single test, but in some
  an  inner test   was likewise present.       Elongate spines or rays project
  from the surfaces       of some forms, but they are very imperfectly
  shown.     In   one or two rare cases, where the section             has passed
  near   the outer surface      of the test, the perforated or lattice-like
  structure, characteristic of these bodies, can be distinguished.
     " The preservation is     too poor for certain identification of genera,
  but the common Genospluera,             Carpospluara, and Cenellipsis are

     " In addition to radiolaria,       sponge   spicules are present      in this
  rock, and some evidently          belong to Hexactinellids.           No other
  organisms    can be recognised.       The rock is evidently of radiolarian
  origin."
     The similarity of this radiolarian jasper to the cherts and jaspers
  of radiolarian     origin, now so well known          from older Palaeozoic
  rocks in different parts of the world, suggests the possibility of the
  existence   of rocks of high antiquity either on Dundee Island or
  within the ice-shed       of that region.      But the    specimen    itself fur
  nishes no satisfactory evidence         of its geological     age.

 them.      The publication of his notes, however,                was   still further
 delayed    in the expectation         that they would be capable            of being

 this  hope      has   not yet been fulfilled,         and   as  so much general
 interest is now felt in Antarctic          exploration, it seems desirable          to
 publish the following details without further delay.

                                 1.   Dundee    Island.
    This collection contains several specimens              of granite and vein-
 quartz, one of a dark green tuff, largely composed                of felspars, and
 one of jasper.       The largest specimen is an angular block of granite
 measuring      5" x 6" x 2".       There are three other specimens            of the
same rock of considerable             size, one of which has evidently been
broken from        a large mass,    and nine small specimens         of granite and
vein-quartz, measuring         about an inch across, and of approximately
 equal dimensions        in the different directions.       These, as well as the
larger specimens, are either angular or sub-angular              — never    perfectly
 rounded,    as   they would have         been  if they   had formed pebbles on
 a beach.     There are no ice-marks on any of the specimens.
    The    granites     belong    to   two varieties — grey and         pink.      The
essential    constituents are oligoclase, orthoclase,           biotite, and horn
blende.       Zircon     and   iron-ores     occur   as  accessory,    epidote     and
chlorite    as    secondary    constituents.        In the    grey   granites    idio-
morphic crystals         of white felspar,       often beautifully       zoned,    and
occasionally      showing the twinning           and extinctions      of oligoclase,
form    a considerable      part of the entire mass.            Biotite and horn
blende, both of which are more or less idiomorphic, also enter into
the   composition of the rock.             The hornblende occurs           sparingly,
and may be either brown or green.                One cross-section,    showing the

forms {110}, {010}, and {100}, is brown in the interior, green on
the exterior, when viewed with rays vibrating                            parallel to the mean
axis of elasticity.           The spaces between the above-mentioned                          idio-
niorphic      constituents are filled up with allotriomorphic quartz and
orthoclase.
   The pink varieties of granite owe their colour to the presence
of fairly large, but for the most part allotriomorphic, individuals of
pink orthoclase.            The well-formed crystals of white felspar, which
enter so largely into the composition of the grey granites, are com
paratively       scarce.          Hornblende           is    entirely    absent.       Quartz       is
abundant, and although never perfectly idiomorphic, it frequently
indents the orthoclase in such                  a    way     as to show      that it was in part
formed before the growth of the felspar had ceased.                                    The most
important difference between                    the pink and the grey granites                  lies
in the fact that the former are more                                largely composed      of the
minerals belonging to the second period of consolidation, that                                     is,
of quartz and orthoclase.
     The tuff     is   a   fine    grained, green rock, the true character                         of
which       can only be determined                     by    microscopic       examination.        It
consists largely of crystals and crystalline fragments of water-clear
felspar.       The individuals         are generally untwinned, less frequently
composed of binary twins, and                    still      less frequently striated.         Next
iu importance to the felspars                   are small       lapilli of   a   volcanic rock of
andesitic character.              The section          shows also several            grains   of   a
pale-coloured       augite, one of brown hornblende, and some of iron-
ore.       Chlorite, partly in the form of vermicular aggregates, occurs
as   a   secondary product, and gives the characteristic colour to the
rock.
     The    fragments of vein-quartz call for no special                             description.
They may very well have been derived from the sedimentary series
which furnished the specimen of radiolarian jasper in which veins
of white quartz occur.

and brown glass.             The magnetite               occurs in well-formed octahedra
and      in crystalline    groups.         It   is   found     as    inclusions in the olivine

and augite,      and is also abundantly        scattered    through the brown
glass.     Olivine    is present    as small crystals of simple form (about
'15 mm.), but does not make up any large proportion of the rock.
Augite occurs in small crystals and crystalline groups.                The   largest
group, consisting of four or live individuals            arranged     in a more      or
less radial manner, measures about -5 mm. across.                In colour,    form,
and mode        of grouping, the augite is somewhat            similar to that       of
the    limburgites.       The   plagioclase   is   a  basic   variety,    probably
labradorite.       The sections are,    as  a rule,  lath-shaped     in form   ;   but
there    is a considerable     amount of variation in the dimensions                 of
the individuals,       and in the proportion of length to breadth.                The
sections     of some of the larger individuals indicate           a  tabular form.
The felspar is remarkably free from inclusions.               It  far exceeds      the
other crystalline constituents in size, the individuals often measur
ing more than       a  millimetre in length.
   The brown glass forms         a considerable     portion of the entire      mass.
The colour is not uniformly distributed, being less marked in                      the
vicinity of augite and magnetite.
   The third pebble is       a more compact      basalt in which olivine,         if  it
occurs     at all, is only represented       by   a  few very minute grains.
 The rock is composed            of acicular microlites of felspar, augite
(scarce), magnetite,       and brown glass.       The microscopic        section of
this    rock    contains one      large  phenocryst      of   plagioclase.        The
microlitic     felspars   are arranged     with their longer        axes   approxi
mately     parallel to one another, thus giving to the rock              a marked
fluidal structure.

Observations on the Theories of Vowel Sounds.                                                       By   John
        G.    M'Kendrick,              Professor of Physiology in the University
        of Glasgow.
                                   (Bead February 7, 1898.)
   The quality of the human voice                                depends      on the same laws as
those determining the quality, klang-tint, or timbre of the tones
produced by any musical instrument.                                   Tones of a mixed                   char
acter, that is to say, composed of a fundamental and partials, are
produced by the vibrations of the true vocal cords, and certain of
those partials are strengthened by the resonance of the air in the
air-passages,        and in the pharyngeal and oral cavities.
   So strongly may certain of these partials be reinforced, as to
obscure or hide the fundamental tone, and give a peculiar char
acter to the sound.               These, however, are only general statements,
and there are still many difficulties in the way of a true interpre
tation of voice-tones.                In the first             place, we observe              that we may
sing a scale, using one sound for each note, such as la, la, la, etc.
Or, by putting the mouth in a certain position, we can pronounce
the so-called          vowels, a,          e,   i,  u (ou as the u in prune), uttering
                                                     o,
the sounds ah,          a, 6, o, ou.             As we do so, we notice that each sound
appears to the ear to have                      a    pitch of its own, different from that
of the       others.         Thus, Helmholtz* gave the pitch of the vowel-
tones as follows         :   —

    Donders,t who was the first to observe that the cavity of the
 mouth for different vowels is tuned to different pitches,                        gave  u
 as f, o as d, a as b'j,, 6 (like oo        in  too) as gz, t) (like aw       in knatr )
 as a", e as c'", and     i as   f".
    Again, we may sing a vowel on              a scale,   and still one can recog
 nise the vowel in each note.              Thus,     if we sing a, or o, or *, on a
 scale beginning      with   c, the ear catches the sound of a, or o, or             • in
 each note.     Such tones are termed vowels, or we might call them
 vowel-tones.
    Theories of Vowel-Tones. — The investigation of vowel-tones may
be considered to date from the experiments of Willis,t about 1829,
who imitated vowels by means of a reed, above which he placed
a resonating      cavity    ;   and his      conclusions       are  very    similar    to
those put forward by Hermann                at the present day.           About 1837,
Wheatstone§ made some observations, and gave a theory. In
later times, the subject has been studied by Donders, Helmholtz,
Koenig,     Hermann, and many others.
    The    invention    of the tinfoil phonograph by Edison in 1877,
and the improvement of the instrument by the labours of Edison,
 Graham Bell, and others in more recent years, until we now pos
sess,  in the wax-cylinder phonograph, an almost perfect mechanism,
have led to the reinvestigation of the whole question of vowel-tone
by Fleeming Jenkin and Ewing, Hermann, Pipping, Boeke, Lloyd,
M'Kendrick,      and others.         The difficulties in the way of account
ing for some of the phenomena               of vowel-tones will be appreciated
when we       state   that competent observers,               such as those above
named     and many others, are             ranged     in two     camps,   — those who

uphold the theory of relative as opposed to those who contend for
the theory of fixed pitch.                  Assuming that a vowel is always a
compound           tone, composed         of  a  fundamental and partials, those
who uphold the relative pitch theory state that                  if the pitch of    the
fundamental tone is             changed, the pitch of the partials must undergo
a   relative      change,      while their      opponents contend that whatever
may be the pitch of the tone produced by the larynx, the pitch of
the partial that gives quality or character to               a  vowel is always the
same,     or, in other        words,   vowel-tones have   a fixed pitch.
    There        are    many methods         of investigating     this  prolilem, but
these       may        be   grouped in two divisions : — lgt, Experimental
methods         by which the pitch of the oral cavity, in the position
suitable for the production of any given vowel, may be deter
mined       ;  and 2nd, mathematical methods by which the curve, or
 wave-form,         representing      a  certain quality of vowel-tone, may be
analysed          into     its   components,      in  accordance      with    Fourier's
 theorem.
     One of the early experiments of Willis * favoured                       the fixed
 pitch theory.           A   piece of watch spring was held by forceps against
 a  revolving toothed wheeL              A   compound tone was produced         which,
 of course, retained the same pitch so long as the wheel revolved
 uniformly. !Now, by keeping the wheel steadily revolving at a
 uniform rate, and at the same time changing the length of the
 portion       of the spring which         was allowed to vibrate, "Willis found
 that the qualities of various vowels were obtained with consider
 able distinctness.            The objection to this experiment obviously is
 that it had nothing           to do with resonating cavities.
      Willis    also used reed pipes attached          to cylindrical chambers        of
 variable length, and altered              the quality of tone by increasing or
 diminishing the length of                the resonant chamber.         The shortest
 tubes gave         r,  then k, a, o, to v.      In this way    he determined the
 pitch of the vowels, as            they sound in words, t

of the mouth, as arranged             for the giving forth of          a   vowel,     was
tuned as   a resonator     for a tone    of a certain pitch, and that different
pitches corresponded        to the forms of the cavity for the                different
vowels.     This    he discovered not by the use of                tuning-forks, but
by the peculiar noise produced in the mouth when the                          different
vowels are whispered.           The cavity of the mouth is then                   blown
like  an organ pipe, and by its resonance             reinforces the correspond
ing partials in the         rushing wind-like         noise.     The question was
then taken up by Helmholtz, * and                      was treated      in  his usual
masterly fashion.         To determine the           pitch of the cavity of the
mouth, considered        as a resonance      cavity, he struck tuning-forks of
different pitches, and held them before the opening of the mouth,
widely    opened.       Then    the    louder the proper tone of the                fork
was    heard,   the   nearer    " it   corresponded       with one of the proper
tones of the included mass of air."                As the     shape of the mouth
could   be altered    at pleasure,    according to the vowel to be emitted,
it  was easy to discover the pitch of the included mass of                      air for
 each vowel.      He came to the conclusion that "the pitch of the
strongest    resonance      of the oral cavity depends             solely upon       the
vowel for pronouncing which the mouth has been arranged."                            He
also found the same resonances for men as for women and children.
He then carefully examined the form of the oral cavity for each
vowel, and showed how very slight changes would account                        for   the
quality being somewhat          altered    for different dialects.
    Helmholtz also showed that the tones of the human voice have
peculiar relation to the human ear.               Thus the upper partials of I
are  in  the neighbourhood           of e"" up to g"", and the human                 ear
itself is   tuned to one of these pitches,                that is to say,       by its
resonance    it favours    the perception      of these tones.        Powerful male
voices produce      these partials strongly.          Thus,    a bass voice    singing
e'  produced the       7th   partial d"",      8th   e"",  9th   f"",  and the     10th
g"".    Some     of these     partials, such       as   e"" and     f",    may   clash,
and, by producing dissonance,             give harshness       to the voice.       This

illustration         'will show how Helmholtz,                 following         out the theory
applicable to all musical instruments, endeavoured                                to explain the
quality of different           voices.     His theory        as to   vowel-tone is summed
up      in  the following sentence            :—
                                                    " Vowel qualities of               tone   conse
quently        are essentially distinguished from the tones                        of most other
musical instruments by the fact that the loudness of their partial
tones does not depend upon the numerical order but upon the abso
lute pitch of those partials.               Thus, when           I sing the        vowel a to the
note Eb> the reinforced tone t"b is the                           12th    partial tone of the
compound          ;   and when      I sing   the same vowel a to the note b'?, the
reinforced        tone is    still  b"b<  but is now the           2nd    partial of the com
 pound tone sung." *
      Further, Helmholtz            endeavoured        to demonstrate             the correctness
 of his view by synthetically combining the tones of certain tuning-
 forks in his well-known vowel-tone apparatus.!                                       He in early
 experiments used eight forks, the first being the fundamental tone
 sij?, and the others          the first seven partials.             Thus      : —
                   sij?     si2b      fa3   si3b       re4     fa4      la4b       si4b-
  The vowel o is well sounded with this apparatus                               when we sound
  sigi?  (characteristic of o) strongly, more feebly si2b> fa3, re3, and the
  fundamental softly,             on is good with eijb strong, and the partials
  feeble.       Using, in another         apparatus,
                    si2b    si3b      fo4   si4b      re5     fa5      la^b       si5b>
  or    was given       with   si2b    (the fundamental) alone,                   o was     sounded
  by fundamental           si2b    moderate,      si3b   strong,     and fa4 weak.              If  we
  sound      si2b (fundamental) along with si3b. and fa moderate,                                  and
  si4b    and re5 strongly, we obtain A. This vowel is characterised                                by
  si4b»    along with the partials               si3b    and     si2b-     To obtain         e,   give
  si2b and si3b moderate,            and faj,    lagb. and si3b         as   strong      as possible.
  The characteristic partial of this vowel                  is si3b-        I    have     performed
  many experiments with this apparatus,                     and find the results obtained
  by Helmholtz to be consistent with experience.                             Much       depends, in
  the appreciation of this experiment, on careful attention, practice,
  and a good ear.

    Koenig investigated the subject with the aid of his manornetrie
flame apparatus.        This method is useful, because it shows the
different forms of the sound wave without change of period, corre
sponding to      a tone of determinate  pitch when the vowels are sung
upon that tone.        The flame picture shows the forms taken      by the
flame when the three         notes ut,, solj, and ut2 are   sung  with    the
vowels    a, o, and ou.

    Each of these pictures is composed of two groups of teeth repro
duced again and again, and thus showing a regular periodic vibra
 tory movement.         The three pictures of ut contain eight groups      of
 teeth, while those of sol contain twelve,      and those   of ut3 sixteen.
 As the length of all these pictures correspond      to the same duration
 of a vibratory state, it is evident that the period of the vibratory
 movement,       or the length of the wave     characteristic of a tone    of
 determinate pitch, is independent of the vowel upon which the
 sound is emitted.        But  the form of the wave characteristic of the
 tone of given pitch varies much with        the vowel upon which      it  is
sung.     This alteration of    the form of the wave, while the period is

constant, must         be due to the super-position of a tone developed                in
the mouth, characteristic of the vowel, upon the                    tone  emitted by
the larynx.*
    According to Koenig, in              man, on is always easily emitted with
sL>t>,  and the neighbouring tones la,, sol, with the lower partials sib.
and mij, ; o is emitted with si3b> the partials la3, sol3, and the lower
partials si2?> mi.h> si? ; a comes with si4b> with la4, with sol4, along
¦with    the lower partials      si3?,  mi3t>> si2b ; e and I are not easily sounded
 on    low tones,      as their characteristic        partials are very high.         On
 tones lower than utj, the female voice turns involuntarily                     to o or
 oc, which have si3b and si2l> as their characteristic partials.                 Above
 fa4    it  is a, of which      si4!>  is characteristic, which       is most   readily
 given.        Above si4 the voice passes into e and i. These observa
  tions of Koenig are harmonious with the conclusions of Ilelniholtz,
  and favour the fixed pitch theory.
      Hallockf       has  recently employed a device             founded on that of
  Koenig.         Eight    resonators      in harmonic      series   were   each    con
   nected    with   a manometric capsule,         and photographs were        taken of
   the eight bands of flame pictures, reflected               in  a mirror, when the
   vowels      were sung before         the   resonators.   {     From these     photo
   graphs the partials present in any vowel-tone within the range of
   the resonators could be determined.                Of course the higher partials,
    on which, as pointed out by Helmholtz,                much depends, were not
    detected.
        Wave forms of Vowel4ones. — We must now turn to the evidence
   adduced by an analysis of the wave forms of vowel-tones.                           To
    appreciate this evidence the following statements               must be kept in
    view : —
        1.  Pitch   depends    on the      length of time in which each single
    vibration is     executed,   or, in other words, on the vibrational            num
    ber of the tone.
        2. Musical    tones are higher the greater their vibrational number
    that   is to say, the shorter the vibrational         period.
        3. The    sensation    excited by       a  periodic vibration    is a musical

tone.     This      tone   is usually   compound,      the constituents      being
partial tones.
    4.  Only    one form of vibration, like that of a pendulum, or the
limbs of a tuning-fork, can give rise to a simple tone, destitute of
partials.     This is    a simple pendular vibration, and the sensation is
a simple tone.
    5.  A  compound tone is the sensation             produced by the simul
taneous action of several simple tones,          with definite ratio of pitch.
Such    a compound tone corresponds          physically to a wave of more or
less complex form.
    6.  Such a compound         wave  is capable     of being analysed     into a
number of simple pendular vibrations, and each pendular vibration
corresponds       to a simple tone, having a pitch determined by the
periodic time of the corresponding motion of the air (Ohm's law).
    7. It is evident that such combinations of simple waves may
give rise to an infinite variety of wave forms             ;  but, according to
Fourier's theorem,* " Any given regular periodic form of vibration
can    always be produced by the addition               of simple vibrations,
having vibrational         numbers,   which    are once,    twice, thrice, four
times,    etc.,    as  great  as  the vibrational      number    of   the   given
motion."
    8.  If we    know the amplitwles of the simple vibrations and the
difference   of   these, then any regularly periodic motion can be shown
to be the sum of a certain number of pendular vibrations               ; in other
words, the compound wave may be analysed into its constituents.

produced by the sounds of vowels. In 1870, Fleeniing Jenkin
and Ewing* succeeded in obtaining tracings of the records of vowel
sounds on the tinfoil phonograph, and the curves                    were submitted
to harmonic analysis. This was the beginning of                   the  present    dis
cussion.        These two observers obtained good curves, even with the
imperfect instrument, and             the curves were submitted to analysis,        so
as to      determine the amplitude of their constituents                 up to the
sixth partial,      and the process of measurement            and calculation was
applied       to more than 100 curves.             The sixth partial was not          a
 high limit to reach, but the phonograph at that date did not record
 the higher partials.             For example, it could not reproduce the
 sound       of I in machine nor          the  French   or   German     0.   Twelve
 values for y (the lengths of the co-ordinates             for one period chosen)
 gave the data for calculating the amplitude             and phases of the first
 six partials.       Professor Tait supplied the authors with the solu
  tions of the simultaneous equations for twelve values of y, and the
  results are given in a series of tables, in which the predominance
  of certain partials       is unmistakable.        In this  way each     vowel was
   examined.       The conclusions arrived at were, on the whole, favour
   able to the constant pitch theory, and were thus summed                    up  : —
   " It   is clear that the quality of         a vowel sound does not depend
   either on the absolute          pitch of reinforcement of the constituent
   tones    alone, or on the simple grouping of relative partials inde
   pendently      of pitch.      Before the constituents for       a vowel can be
   assigned, the pitch of the prime must be given, and, on the other
   hand, the pitch of the most strongly reinforced partial is not alone
   sufficient   to allow us to name          the  vowel.    To   do this, we must
   also know the relation of the constituent partials to one another."                f
   Again, " the      ear is guided by two factors,        one depending on the
   harmony or group of relative partials, and the other on the abso
   lute pitch of the reinforced constituents."              The ear recognises,      as
   it  were, when     it hears a vowel sung at any pitch, the         kind of oral
   cavity causing the         reinforcement.      As to    the  question,

the resonance       cavity for a vowel sound has an absolute                 pitch, it
may have a certain effect          in reinforcing other subordinate tones or
partials.     While experimentally it may be shown that a constant
cavity may produce         a vowel-like      tone, say o, over a wide range of
pitch, it is probable that the resonant cavities of the human being
are slightly adjustable, so as to be, as            it  were, tuned to the       pitch
on which       the   vowel is sung.        In other words, Fleeming Jenkin
and   Ewing hold that both             the  relative and the absolute factors
enter    into the composition of a vowel,             a  conclusion not far from
the truth.
   The subject was taken up by Hermann * about 1890, and he used
the much improved wax-cylinder phonograph.                       He   succeeded      in
obtaining photographs of the curves on the wax cylinder, a beam
of light reflected      from    a   small mirror attached         to the vibrating
disk of the phonograph being allowed to fall on                  a  sensitive plate,
while     the   phonograph was slowly travelling.                The    curves thus
obtained,     representing the wave-forms of the vowel- tones,                   were
very beautiful.        They were submitted to analysis, with the view
of estimating the pitch of the mean partial or the "formant," as
it is called by Hermann, according to the method described                      in  Dr
Lloyd's paper already referred to.              Hermann also pointed out that
the quality of a vowel-tone varies              considerably, according to the
rate at which the cylinder was rotated.                 This should obviously be
not the case were the relative pitch theory correct.                  It  is curious
that, even with competent           observers,   there should be such       difficulty
in deciding this apparently simple question of fact, some asserting
that there is no difference             in quality,     and   others   as  positively
stating that there is        a difference     when the cylinder is caused            to
move     slowly.     After many experiments,            I  have come to the con
clusion that there is      a  difference but not so great        as to  disguise the
quality of the vowel.          The ear can always distinguish o, or a, or e
at   different rates, but the quality is undoubtedly                 altered.      The
sound of a vowel never passes, in my judgment, into the sound of
another vowel.         Professor Hermann maintains the reverse.
   Hermann        presents   the fixed     pitch theory in a modified form,
and states      that there is for each vowel             a  characteristic tone — a
formant.       The pitch of the formant, however, may vary consider-

      Sauberschwartz \ has investigated the subject by an ingenious
 application of the laws of the interference of sound.                              Certain
  vowels were sung into the mouthpiece of                      a   long tube, to which
  other short tubes of definite length were attached.                      By closing     the
  outer ends         of certain of these tubes,            various partials could          be
 extinguished          by interference, and the listener at the other end of
 the tube observed an alteration in the quality of the vowel.                         Thus,
 by extinguishing          the formant of a, the sound approximated to that
 of o, and became somewhat nasal.                      With  e there      are two charac
 teristic      formants, and Sauberschwartz found that if one of these
  was extinguished, the quality of the vowel was not much altered,
  but that when both            were     shut out, the vowel was much changed
  in quality, and approximated to               u or o.    Sauberschwartz in general
 supports Hermann.

      of the phonograph, but he has applied the Fourierian analysis with
      striking           results in            general support of the fixed pitch                                  theory.*
      The method consists in measuring microscopically the transverse
      diameter of the impressions on the surface                                            of the         phonograph
      cylinder, on different (generally equidistant)                                      parts of the period,
      and in inferring                      from these measurements                      the depth of the im
      pressions              on the same spot, or, in other words, deriving from them
      the curve of the tone which produced the impression.
                [Dr M'Kendrick                 here      alluded to Dr Boeke's paper, describing
      his method, in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,

            The following analyses, supplied by Boeke, are very instructive.

            Contrast this analysis with that of the vowel a, sung by Boeke
      (aged 50) on                 the notes         /   and    c',   and the same vowel on the notes
      of              and c", sung by his son, aged 12, both like the vowel                                            in the
      word " heart."                     It will     be seen,         from the analytical numbers,                       that
      the formant of the son's                           vowel a was almost the same                          as   that of

          A study of     these figures         will show (1) that the man's                  resonance
      rises slightly   (J     semitone) in ascending 7 semitones                     in the middle
      of his register       ;  (2) that the boy's resonance rises                   3 semitones        in
      ascending 9 semitones             in the upper half of his register                ;  and in the
       mid-register the boy's resonance                   is to the man's          as    5:4.      This
      indicates that, as we ascend               a scale    in singing     a  vowel, the pitch of
      the oral cavity slightly changes.
           Dr Lloyd holds           a view differing from those                already described.
      Vowels, according to him, owe their character,                        not to the resonance
      of a partial or partials of a certain fixed pitch, but to the relative
      pitch of two     or more partials.              This view       accounts     for   a  fact which
      is not explained by the other theories,                    namely,    that the articulation
      of   a vowel seems to be the same for a child as for an adult.                              Thus,
      in the vowel     a, as      in " fat," sung         on a note      having      a   pitch of 134
      v.d., Lloyd finds two partial.*,                  the lower of which              he terms     the
      pharyngeal      or a-rcsonance,           and the other the oral or /J-resonance.
       Of these the lower for a in " fat " has a vibrational number of
       736 v., while the upper has 1121.                     The ratio of these two partials
                        1 121
       is. therefore,             =  1 "47.      This     is termed       by Lloyd the radical
                         763
       ratio, and it determines the nature of the vowel.                                   Again,    the
      radical ratio of the Swedish long a is                    1 :35.
           The following instructive curves                  were     sent to me by         Dr   Boeke.

They are tlie curves, taken by Boeke's method, of the vowel       a (" as
in fat ") sung by M'Kondrick, Boeke, Pipping, and Hermann on a
pitch of ut„ = 128 v.d. and nt.,^256 v.d.        The curves are instruc

      The 4"' partial in each of these four analyses shows                                       a   palpable
 falling off in strength,          as compared                with its neighbours                    on either
 side, and this falling off marks in each                           ease    the gap between an

 The vowel o, however low                it   may be sung, can hardly have                                   more
 than two partials intermediate to the two culminations.                                             In      three
 out of the four cases above                    given,        it   has only one intermediate
 partial.       This   common      partial must be subject to                       a   strong influence

from both resonances           at one time.         All the other partials       are
situated so much nearer            to the one resonance        than to the other
that they may be regarded as being under the sole influence of the
former.        The    common      partial,   on   the   other hand, receives       a
stimulus from each, and it must be remembered                   that these stimuli
are mutually independent, as the             one operates    in the oral and the
other in the pharyngeal cavity, and that it is a matter of chance
whether, in any phonogram analysed, these two stimulations operate
to exaggerate       or to conceal    each    other in the tabulated numerical
strength of the partial.         Thus it    comes to be a question of phase.
    Dr Lloyd      has evaluated the a- and ^-resonances of the vowel o, as
above given, and stated the result            in the following table : —

    These four available instances give an average of 368 v.d. for
a-resonance,       of 688 v.d. for      /J-resonance, and of       1-916   for the
radical ratio.       A sounder method would           be to take from one voice
a sufficient      number of o analyses          to constitute an average, thus
eliminating       the chances which cause the common               partial to vary
to such a noticeable degree.
    It would     appear, also, on some vowel-tones that the intensity             of
the fundamental          or prime tone is weaker than one of the upper
partials.      Helmholtz laid special emphasis on this observation, and
he put the statement conversely, namely,                 that vowel-tones differ
 from those        of ordinary     musical instruments in that one of the
upper partials        is more    marked than the         prime.     Hermann     also
supports this view         ; and, in a communication            to myself, Boeke
expressly states that his analyses bring out the same fact.                 On the
other hand, Auerbach * maintains that the prime tone is always
the strongest. Lord llayleight is also of this opinion, while he
admits that in the vowel a the fundamental is not heard so loudly
as   in other vowels.        Hermann      suggests    that when the prime tone
 is heard     of very weak intensity, it may exist only in the             ear,  but

   General          Conclusion.     — It would            appear, on the whole, that the
truth does not rest entirely on the                           side       of one theory, hut that
both are partially true. The view of Donders, that each vowel
has a mouth cavity of unchangeable and fixed pitch, is too exclusive,
and, on the other hand, it cannot                          be denied (as is             virtually     done
by those who uphold the relative pitch theory) that each vowel has
a predominant partial or predominant partials which give it a
definite      character, and which                     must be produced                 by the mouth
cavity as       a   whole, or by the double resonance                            of portions of         the
cavity,      as contended by             Lloyd.           When       a   vowel is spoken either
separately or        as    it exists in      a   word, the complex tone is produced
by       the vocal        cords.     Thu         resonance         chambers        above      assume      a
certain form, and            one or more             partials peculiar to the vowel are                  so
 strengthened        as    to give such character to the vowel-tone                         as to enable
 the ear at once to identify it.                     As   the      form of the mouth cavity
 varies in individuals             and in different races, the partials may not                          be
 identical in each case, but they will be so near a common pitch                                         as
 to enable the ear at once to identify the vowel.                                 If,   however, men
 of different        nationalities        attempt to fix the absolute pitch of the
 partial     they      will not      agree,       as    has     been      found to       be   the case.
 Again, in singing           a   vowel in        a   scale, very slight          alterations in the
 form of the resonance                  cavities take place.                In    passing     from the
 lower to the higher notes the larynx rises, and more or less of                                         a
 muscular strain acts on the walls of the resonance cavities.                                         Thu-
 there must be         a   slight change in the volume of these cavities lead
 ing to the development of partials different from those formed                                          by
 the cavity at rest or in speech, but                      still   so sufficiently near as uu
 materially to alter the quality of the tone.                              Consequently the ear
 still    recognises       the   tone    of the vowel, even when sung at                          a   high
 pitch, and     it   may even recognise                the special        quality of     a    particular
 voice.      Sometimes, though rarely, the quality may become richer
 as the voice rises in pitch            ;    usually for each voice there                is   a   register
 in which the voice              has its maximum                of good quality.              It   is   not
 surprising, therefore, that             a   singer almost instinctively chooses such
 vowels as best suit the resonating arrangements of his or her voice,
 and avoids tones, vowels, and words containing vowels that would
 force the production of notes of inferior quality.

to manage than those of the above-mentioned investigators, yields,
nevertheless,              very satisfactory                    results       ;   and     2nd, that the         same

persons of different age, sex, and nationality.

a    somewhat elaborate                      manner, but since then                       I        have   applied my

the above-mentioned ellipse.
     It    is true that the supposition                     about the axis of the marker
does not hold good                    in using the phonograph,                as,   in that           ease,     it
makes a certain angle, a, with the tangent                          ;   but the only difference
which this point occasions                       in   the   results is this, that they would
have to be multiplied                      by the constant term cos a to obtain their
real value,           which, of course, is not necessary in the                         case    of sound
curves.           Since the marker is constantly moving up and down on
account       of the vibration               of the glass membrane,               the value           of    the
angle a changes                every moment,            but these changes               are so minute
(since the            greatest      depth of the impressions does not exceed 0O2
mm.) that they may be neglected without any objection.
 Once for all, a list of the depths (d) was calculated by means of
the       formula (2), answering to every transverse                              diameter       //    which
might be expected.
     For this          purpose       the diameter of the marker was cut out                                in   a
thin layer of paraffin                     on a glass       plate, and was measured out by
means        of the same ocular micrometer which                              was to be used for
measuring              the    transverse         diameter of        the impressions on                      the
cylinder.              The diameter of the recording marker proved to be
fifty-six divisions of the ocular micrometer,                           or 1'0318 mm.                 Gener
ally the largest transverse                      diameter of the             impressions         did not
exceed twenty divisions of the micrometer, which corresponds to                                                  a
depth of          1   '847 divisions, or 0 01           7   mm.

before       a    window            with     a   northern     exposure.           The     axis of the
mandrill, G, on which the cylinder of the phonograph, H, is placed,
carries      a    drum,       1',   the outside of which           is   divided         into 360 equal
parts.        By means of            a     little pointer, W, you can read the divisions
of the drum.                  The axis of the mandrill, G, carries                       also   a     cogged
wheel, A, catching                   a   pinion       on the axis       of   a    second        drum,           Q,

of    a   pointer,       W.         The gearing of wheel            and pinion            is    such that

    The microscope, C,       used  to examine the       impressions on      the
phonograph cylinder, may slide up and down along its standard,
and may be fastened at the proper height by a screw, D. The
foot of the microscope is movable in a wooden sledge, E, along
which it may be moved forward and backward till the proper
situation for accurate examination of the impressions is found.
Generally it should be moved a little beyond the axis of                    the
cylinder, in order that sufficient light should fall upon them.
                                    Fig. 2.
     The   sledge, E, together with the microscope      which it carries      is
  movable parallel to the axis of the cylinder, H, by means of                 a
  cogged bar,   FF, and pinion, 0,   and    its position may   be   accurately
  determined by a scale, SS.       By this arrangement it       is possible  to
  find again any mark on the surface of the cylinder,       II,   the position
  of which has once been determined by means of the microscope.
  But  as  it happened sometimes that the cylinder moved a little
  on the  mandrill, it was necessary to make quite sure of the identity
  of the observed    marks ;  this was done by means of       a cross   mark,

92            Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
which was placed upon the surface of the cylinder, and its position
accurately determined.
   For  the microscopical         examination of the impressions a magni
fication of about fifty proved            sufficient.         This    was obtained      by
using Zeiss' objective A. A. and ocular                2,   provided with an ocular
micrometer, which was divided               in two directions perpendicular              to
each other,     into fifty parts.       Further       magnifying       proved inadvis
able,  as  the    light failed,    and   the    curved surface         of the cylinder
hindered accurate results.
    When    a  phonograph cylinder, the contents of which were exactly
known,     was     to be subjected to measurement,                   the   place  of   the
cylinder on the mandrill was once for all fixed by means of a                        cross
mark made in the surface, the position of which was accurately
determined by means of the drum, P, and the scale, SS.                          Then   the
position of each vowel sound,            and,    if   necessary,     the number of its
periods,   were      determined      by   turning       the    cylinder    in the    same
direction     in which      it had     been     turned when taking             them    up.
At   the same time, by the microscopical examination of the periods
of each vowel, their fitness to be measured could be judged of.
    After this "grazing off" — so             to call      it— of   the whole cylinder
 the measuring of the         transverse diameter of the fit periods could
be undertaken.          As the latter only gives the ordinate of the curve,
it  was necessary      to obtain the abscissa corresponding to it.
    The value of the abscissae was determined in two ways.
    I. First by measuring the diameter of a period only on that
 spot where it attained either a maximum or a minimum, and by
 measuring the distance from maximum to minimum by means                                  of
 the  perpendicular part of the             ocular micrometer, the             horizontal
 part of which had served to determine the transverse                      diameter.
    But as the curved surface of the cylinder proved                         a great   hin
 drance   for accurate       measurements,          in my later experiments             the
 distance of maximum to minimum, i.e., the value of the abscissa,
 was determined by means of the drum, Q, which                           should indicate
 this distance on      a tenfold magnified scale.
    By-and-by, however,          I came    to the disagreeable           conclusion that
 the drum, Q, did not do what            it should        do.
    By measuring out           the   length of some            subsequent periods         of
 sounds,   such     as  that of    a  cornet-a-piston, or that of a telephone

trumpet— the length of which ought, obviously,                      to be constant —
by means of the drum, Q,               I found that the number of divisions
through which the drum, Q, had                to be turned for each period was
by no means constant, but varied in the most capricious manner.
           I
     As soon found out that this result was the consequence of the
 teeth of the wheel, A, and its pinion not always being in close
 contact,     I   tried to mend this by making the teeth cling constantly
 together by means of a weight, turning the axis of the cylinder in
 a direction opposite to that in which it was turned by means of the
  drum, Q. This arrangement, indeed, made the readings of the
  drum, Q, reliable. But only where there were a small number of
  underwaves did it prove practicable to measure the abscissa; as well
  as the ordinates of the curves.           In most cases it would have been
  too fatiguing for the eye to read alternately the ocular micrometer
  and the divisions of the drum, Q.
       II. For this reason, in most cases           a second     mode of procedure
   was employed        to determine at the same time the abscissa? as well
   as   the ordinates of the vowel curves under examination.
       This consisted in measuring out the            transverse     diameter of the
   impressions on equidistant spots, which proceeding would obviously
   lead equally well to the exact form of the curve.                     I  tried to do
   this by means of       a  clockwork, working on the axis of the mandrill
   on which the phonograph cylinder               was    placed.     This clockwork
   was provided        with   a stay  pressed    upwards by       a   spring.     While
   looking through the         microscope   a  gentle pressure of the finger was
   sufficient to make the clockwork run through               j^jj    of  a  revolution.
   But in this case also it was found that the apparatus did not do
   what it should.         It was, however, a long time before I discovered
   that the movement of the clockwork                was not at      all uniform,     so
    that the abscissae of the curve which           I  derived from my measure
    ments were not equal to each other,          as I  had supposed them to be.
        Since   I   came  to this    conviction    only gradually,       after having
    tried, without success, to regulate by different means the movement
    of the clockwork, many of the numerous measurements                         which   I
    have made by means of this             clockwork       lack the     precision and
    reliability which       vowel   curves ought       to   have.      Neither     by  a
    stronger spring in the clockwork, nor by the application of                 a weight
    pulling the cylinder either in the same direction              as the     clockwork

did, or in the opposite one, could                 a  thoroughly constant movement
of the cylinder be obtained, and the worst of it was that the devia
tions from the intended course were without any regularity, and did
not answer to my expectations.
     I tried   afterwards to correct the curves obtained by remeasuring,
in the      same     period, the distance of maximum                         to  minimum by
means      of the vertical part of the ocular micrometer referred                               to.
But finally I dropped              the     clockwork        altogether, anil        I   use   now
the divisions of the drums,                P   and     Q, exclusively for the measure
ment of the abscissse.              In order, however,              to be able to measure
ordinates and        abscissa1    of the curve at the same time,                      I  had the
inner edge of the drum, Q, made so                     as to be     provided with shallow
rrrooves     made      by   a  file   at     each    of its 360 divisions.              In  these
grooves      a   tooth     catches,       fastened       to     a  spring,      the   power      of
which may be regulated               by a screw.*             By screwing the latter on,
it  is even possible        to make        the   edge of the         drum quite free from
the tooth.        If  the latter is pressed           by the spring against the edge
it is possible,       by turning       the     drum very carefully with the hand,
while looking          through the          microscope,        to   make it stop at each
groove     made      by   the   lilo, viz.. after        :(rtVn    °f   a  revolution      of  the
cylinder.
    But without         the   application        of    a  weight the same failure,               as
described above, occurred again, for instead of ten shocks, the drum,
Q, ought to be turned through                  a varying number of shocks in order
to    make     the drum,       P, and       the   cylinder       it carried move through
exactly           of its circumference.
    After   some trials, however, a suitable weight was found, attached
to a wire running over the wheel, R, which drew the drum,                               P, round
in a direction opposite to that in which                     it  was turned by the hand.
This arrangement            caused      the    teeth     of the wheel and pinion                to
cling permanently to each                 other, so that the movements of the
cylinder were nearly equal               to each       other every time that the care
fully-turned      drum, Q, stopped by the tooth catching the groove.
    The above-described           mode of measuring the impressions was used
exclusively in my later experiments, and it gave reliable results.
    The arrangement by which it was possible to move the cylinder,
      This arrangement is not to         be seen    on fig. 2, as   it is concealed   behind the
drum, Q, and the wheel, A.

while making the measurements through the microscope, by each
shock through AJ0 0 of a circumference, was chosen because the
periods of my own voice, while speaking, required about forty shocks
of drum, Q, or ^5 of the circumference of the cylinder, and because
forty ordinates were required to make the Fourierian analysis of the
curves by means of Prof. Hermann's " Schablonen."
      The numbers        of the       measured      breadths were      dictated to nn
 assistant and written at first upon loose papers, but afterwards in a
 book, which proved more satisfactory, as it was sometimes difficult
 to follow them afterwards in              the   vastly increasing number of loose
 papers.       Of  course,  it was exceptional when the periods required
 exactly 40 shocks of drum, Q,               and   as the number of shocks varied
 between 20 and         60,   it  was necessary       to divide the curve obtained
  into 40 equal      parts, so as to be able to submit its 40 ordinates to
  the harmonic analysis.
       As it took    a good     deal of calculation       to obtain this result, all
   periods were drawn in a constant length of                   200    mm.,  and  once
   for all, a number of strips of millimetre-paper                were   made, each of
   them measuring 200 mm. in length, but divided into a different
   number of equal parts, varying from 20 to 60 parts, with the
    number inscribed      on them.          These strips were sufficient to draw
    the whole curves of any pitch in            a length of 200 mm.
        From the    measured       breadths of the period were deduced              the
    depths corresponding         to them,      by means of the above-mentioned
    list, and, by multiplying        the numbers obtained by         a suitable factor,
    all the ordinates     were     reduced      to whole numbers not exceeding
    20 to 30.      The ordinates were             marked on the millimetre-paper
    by means of     dots in their proper places, by using the strips referred
    to, and then the curve was               drawn    with   a  finely-pointed   pencil
     through the dots     as smoothly as possible.             When     the curve was
     thus obtained, the length of its ordinates,           5  millimetres apart from
     each   other, was determined           by means of       an eyeglass ;   and   the
     forty ordinates    so obtained were inscribed on a sheet of centimeter
     paper as described by Prof. Hermann.*                  It was found     most con
     venient to mark the ordinates themselves with red ink and the
     values   of their  cosines     with     black   ink, in which way mistakes

   An analysis may           be made   by Prof. Hermann's
                                                                  " Schablonen       "
in   much       shorter   time and much        more    smoothly       than in the
ordinary manner.           It does not generally take more than an hour or
two.     It  is true that the ratio of the ordinates to their abscissae in
the curves obtained in this way,         in some cases, differs widely          from
the real one, but this obviously does not matter for harmonic analy
sis.    For   the study of the curve itself the adopted dimensions were
very convenient and useful.           The curve with its real ratio of height
and length would be wholly unfit for examination.
   The length of the periods of vowels uttered by myself was about
      of the circumference of the cylinder, which generally had a
value of 173-174 mm.              The length of such     a  period being conse
quently about l-93 mm., its greatest             height did not even reach
0-02 mm.      ;  so that in a curve drawn on a hundred times              magnified
scale,   the    largest   underwave would       not even      have     a height    of
2 mm.
   The calculations of the value of a and           h,  a.,  and b.y,  etc., and   of
the amplitudes of the harmonic constituents                ,/a3 + b'1,  Jaf + b*,
etc.,   were     not made, as Prof. Hermann            advises,   on     the centi
meter-paper itself, but on          a separate   sheet    of paper,     which was
kept together with the sheet containing the numbers, so that it
was possible       to correct any mistakes afterwards.          Since the centi
meter paper (which is rather expensive) contains thirty-four                 vertical
columns, and since every analysis requires eleven                  of these,     one
sheet    of it is sufficient for three analyses,        if the calculations       are
made on a separate paper.
    Up till now      I  have made about 350 Fourierian         analyses,    most   of
them from vowel curves.
   The     values     of the amplitudes      of the partials obtained were
generally reduced in such a way that the amplitude of the funda
mental tone         Jax  + hl was taken as unit.          It  is a curious       fact
that the amplitude of the fundamental tone,                 when vowel sounds
are subjected to analysis, is by no means          greater     than that of the
partials, in most cases even much smaller.                Especially in spoken
vowel? the amplitude of the fundamental tone is relatively small.
This explains the fact that it is almost impossible                    to estimate
the pitch in which a vowel is spoken by simply hearing                  it

 On the Fourierian Analysis of Phonographic Tracings

      It    is a great advantage           and satisfaction to work from           curves
 taken by the phonograph itself, because it is then possible                    to repro
 duce and verify by actual hearing the sound supposed to                       be repre
 sented by given curves.               This ought always to be done, even with
 the phonograph,            and the slightest change of timbre should be care
 fully noted         ; for the given curve represents            not really the original
  sound, but the sound given back by the phonograph.                         Every plate
  or membrane           vibrates more readily and strongly to some pitches
  than to others,         and in a composite          sound     it is  almost inevitable
  that some of its         elements are recorded         with more, and others with
   less, than their original relative force.                Different vibrators hence
    yield quite different-looking           phonograms       for the same sound.         In
    vowels it seems fortunately            to happen that considerable        changes in
    the relative force of the component                vibrations may occur without
    altering      the vowel.      It   is   the pitch of the components             which
    matters     ;  and that is not altered by an efficient vibrator.              Assum
    ing a knowledge of the methods                  by which       the record    dug ver
     tically into the phonographic cylinder is displayed horizontally for
     examination and analysis,             we note that a satisfactory Fourierian
     analysis demands         a  sufficient number of measurements.               A  single
     wave is taken        (AA, BB,      fig.  1), and    referred    to rectangular axes
      OX, OY.         Abscissa? of equal length are measured               off along OX,
      and ordinates      are drawn to meet the curve, and are very accurately
      measured.        For  a simple curve like      AA    a  few ordinates suffice, but
       if  the   curve   is complex,      the   number of measurements            must bo
       increased    until  no considerable       curvature exists between the sum
       mits of any two successive           ordinates.     It  can be seen at a glance
        that the curve    BB, with twice the number of ordinates                 possessed
        by AA, is insufficiently registered.           "When     a  sufficient number of

  number of partials, or somewhat                less, suffices   to define     the curve.
  A   curve  may bo reconstituted              graphically from its analysis, but
  the   process   is   laborious when the             partials are many.           Donkin
  invented an instrument called              the harmonograph,         which suffices      to

 describe a curve       compounded          of any two harmonic curves.                The
 principle of this machine             could probably be extended                so as to
 describe the     curve     represented        by any given Fourierian           analysis,
 each partial being        set going       in the given amplitude and at                the
 given phase.         This    curve    could be at once compared                 with   the
 original, and their difference,           if  any, could be seen and analysed.
 Broadly speaking,       the loudness        of subjective impression        varies with
 the amplitude of the vibrations               causing    it.    But there are known
 exceptions,    e.g.,   tone is produced by beats, though,                 if  the   beat-
curve were analysed,          it is manifest that this tone would come                  out
 with an amplitude of zero.             Hermann affirms* that not only              beats,
but every     thing periodic in            a   phonogram,       is heard     as   tone   of
the given period        or pitch.       It   is certain, at any rate, that, in         the
case   of a vocal     phonogram,       the tone on which            it is sung may       be
heard from     it distinctly,     and     yet    the amplitude of that particular
tone, the fundamental, may               be   almost    zero in the analysis.          But

though      it represents no amplitude, it               represents  a   very distinct
period or repetition, for         the whole         curve repeats      itself at eacli
vibration of the glottis,        so long as the same note              and the same
vowel are held.       But   the upper partials are none of them associated
with any visible period of this kind,               and may be taken to be sub
jectively present in the degree denoted by their amplitude in                        the
analysis, with qualifications to be hereafter mentioned.
     What is it which confers          upon     a   certain note the quality of        a
 certain vowel    1   It is undoubtedly the          articulation, — the     shape into
 which the mouth and pharynx               are thrown in order to produce the
 vowel.      Vary the articulation        and you vary the vowel            ;  maintain
 the articulation and you maintain the vowel, tcJietlin- you maintain
 the same tone     or not.   You    may even abolish            the tone, and speak
 in whisper, but you still have the same vowel, if the articulation is
 maintained.       What power, then, has the articulation over the tone                 ?
 None whatever,        except    that of resonance.             The  cavities of the
  articulation   have the power          to  magnify certain         partials of the
  glottal note, and to damp        others.       They magnify those which are
  nearest to the pitch of their own proper resonances,               and they damp
  the remainder.      This  is best seen by examples.
     It is impossible to take a phonogram             from the larynx which shall
  be  totally uninfluenced by the voice-passage, because the tone must
  always come through the voice-passage.                   But  we may choose from
  among available phonograms          that of    a  vowel which seems to be least
  influenced by the voice-passage, because it has the simplest articula
  tion and the least distinctive quality.             The ideal vowel would be         a
  simple emission of voice, like the interjection              Uh.   Nearest to this
  come Hermann's phonograms          of German short u.           The analysis of one

We     conclude       from this, what might have been surmised a                                     priori,
that, apart from the disturbing influence of resonance, the partials of
the glottal note tend to produce                 themselves           in   a   descending scale of
amplitude as they rise in pitch.                       No doubt there                 are    individual
differences    —dull     voices       tapering down quickly,                    bright voices less
quickly, shrill voices           still   less    quickly,          in amplitude of partials.

other on the 10th partial.                      But      observe   how much narrower in
range are these reinforcements of                    i   than those of aa, for these upper
resonances      of   i   affect only one or two high partials                 ;   the neighbour
ing partials are not reinforced at all, though they are hardly two
semitones     removed.           The two resonances are both comprised within
a space     of six semitones
                        (7th to 10th partials), and yet, within that
narrow space, are sharply marked off from each other by the prac
tical absence of the 9th partial.                    This results from       the nature of the
cavity in which the resonance is generated. One of these resonances
of i is certainly generated by the narrow tube formed between the
tongue and the hard palate in the articulation of that vowel (Helm-
holtz, Sensations of Tone, p. 108).  Hence its narrowness of range ;
for a tube will not respond to any tone which differs much from its
own.      But   a rounded cavity has a range of resonance which increases
with every increase              in the size of its aperture or apertures.                           The
articulation of aa consists of two such cavities, of rather wide aper
ture (see figures in            Journ. of Anat.,            loe.   cit.), and     1    believe,      after
actual measurements of the articulation, that the two reinforcements
displayed       in   the phonograms             of this vowel (e.g., fig.          .3)   can be satis
factorily traced to the proper resonances                            of these two cavities.
 Hence its       two reinforcements are seen to spread                                over   a    whole
octave    (4th   to 8th partials) and even                   then do not find space with
 out some overlapping, for the 6th partial seems to be reinforced by
both.     The question          has been warmly argued whether the Fourierian
analysis accurately represents                  the facts of vowel- resonance                    or not.
Does    it   follow, because         a     vibration can be analysed into                    a   certain
note and its partials, that the                     vowel objectively consists of those
partials,    and nothing more               1    Hensen and Pipping say yes                      ;   Her
mann says that the higher-pitched                         elements    are not partials at all,
but     independent         resonances.             A     middle     opinion       seems best to
deserve adoption.               It   is   as difficult      to conceive      the voice passing
through       the articulation            of    a   given vowel without                arousing the
proper tone of the cavities passed through, as                          it   is   to conceive         the
voice passing through the same articulation without having its own
partials reinforced or damped.                       In   the Fourierian          analysis       we get
 both of these           elements         together    ;   they cannot        be discriminated.
But the proper tones of the cavities must undoubtedly Ix; present
 in some degree.           It    seems moat probable,               too, that they are suffi

cicntly    strong to be recognised                separately     by the ear,          as   they
certainly are in whisper, and that it                 is thus we arrive at the cogni
tion of the vowel, as distinguished                 from that of the musical tone.
We need not doubt the power of the ear to make this separate
cognition    ;   it  is a much simpler matter than the separate cognition
of two voices heard simultaneously                  ;   and the fact that the reson
ances are not, except            by accident, harmonic to the glottal tone, or
to any of its partials, may reasonably be thought                         to afford to the
ear a criterion         of distinction   ; though the auditory mechanism                     for
                                                                               '
such a distinction           may not yet have been made clear.                    But if the
phonogram         contains     inharmonic elements,           how is it possible that it
can    be   completely analysed            into     harmonic elements?                 Simply
because     the     inharmonic       elements,      that is to say the resonances,
arise and fall        within the limits of         each wave       of the phonogram             :
they take      a   fresh start at each opening of the glottis.                     Hermann
has illustrated         this very fully (op. eit.).           They are thus periodic,
though not harmonic; and anything periodic can be analysed
approximately into harmonic partials of a tone of that period.
    As  a  matter of fact the inharmonic                   elements     come out in the
analysis     mainly        as   apparent reinforcements            of those        harmonic
elements       which       they most closely resemble,              i.e.,   of those very
partials which they really reinforce.                    Hence,    for the purpose            of
 locating and evaluating the proper pitch of a resonance,                          it  is prac
tically immaterial whether we adopt Hensen's                       view or Hermann's,
or an intermediate one.              In any     case, the locality of any reinforce
 ment of the partials indicates in                 a general      way the pitch of the
 resonance      which has caused it.              We     may proceed,       in   fact, to use
 the data of the          reinforcements to calculate the independent pitch
 of the resonance.            But  on doing so, certain preliminary questions
 present themselves           for solution.
    Before trying to deal with these, a class of facts may bo noted
 which go to show that the reinforcements seen in vowel-phonograms
 are also, in some          considerable    measure,        real  partials of the glottal
 note.    Let     a good male      voice sing o, a,       i  in their Italian      values,    at
 a pitch about 165           v.d. — the middle         e  of a bass voice.          Not only
 does the vowel change, but the musical quality of the tone changes
 also.    The brightest vowel is a           ;   the o is agreeable, but softer and
 duller  ; the      i  is much thinner         in quality, and sometimes incisive

 rather than strong.       Compare this with what happens to the partials
 of each of these vowels in their phonograms.              In the a phonograms
 we have a richly harmonic          set  of strong partials from the 4th to
the 8th (fig. 2) ; in the o phonograms it is the lower and softer
harmonics which come strongly into evidence, from the 2nd to the
4th   ;  whilst in the     i  phonograms of this pitch (fig.          4  is not an
exact illustration, because it is sung at           a much higher pitch, and,
as the resonance        remains unchanged, the reinforcements naturally
appear on much lower partials) there is strong                  reinforcement of
the 2nd partial, and again of the 13th and 14th, or 16th and 17th,
— high     partials of a penetrating dissonance,          but all the richer and
higher harmonics are only feebly present.                If   the reinforcements
were not to a large        extent true partials, — not merely concomitant
inharmonic resonances, — these effects could scarcely follow.
    The evaluation of the pitch of any resonance which only reinforces
a single      partial is exceedingly simple.          It   is expressed      by the
equation
                                      » = Njp.
    Where N is the pitch-number of the fundamental tone,                    p is the
number of the partial, and n is the pitch-number of the required
resonance.        In  fig. 4, for example,     the isolated reinforcement of
the 10th partial in         a vowel sung at 293 v.d. proves the existence
of   a resonance      of 293x 10 = 2930 v.d.          The case in which two
partials are equally reinforced is not quite so simple.              "We may say
approximately that
e.g.,   in  fig. 4 the resonance      which     reinforces the 7th and           8th

partials is about 293 x            = 2198   v.d.     But    even here there are
minor considerations involved, which can only be seen clearly after
examining one or two more general and more complex                   cases.
    Let    us   first take an     instance   of German long a, sung and
analysed       by Hermann       {Pfl. Arch., xlvii. 355).           The pitch is
98 v.D., and the analysis is only carried to ten partials, so that it
does not display the higher resonance of this vowel, except slightly
on the 10th partial, which is all the better for the present purpose.

   This analysis displays but one considerable reinforcement ; but
it extends, in varying strength, over the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th
partials.      This reinforcement probably springs, like that of the
5th       partial (875 v.d.) in fig. 3, from the resonance of the
intra-velar or pharyngeal cavity of these a vowels.                                                      But for the

a theory of origin, but to call this the a-resonance.                                                    How are we,

resonance             in   each case          1     Hermann used what he called a centre-
of-gravity calculation, i.e., he proceeds                                  as    if       he were finding                     the
centre      of gravity of four heavy points situated                                               as above,           on the
axis of x, and each weighing as many units as there are units in
the respective               amplitudes. Having thus discovered                                              the

resonance itself.                  Both operations are combined in the equation

     that the partials are equidistant from one another.                             It    is true that
     they are equidistant when considered                   as an arithmetical progression,
     — 1st partial, 98 v.d.; 2nd partial, 19G v.d.; 3rd partial, 294 v.d.,
    etc.      Eut musical distances are not measured in arithmetical but
    in geometrical progression              ; and the equidistant partials are not the
    1st, 2nd,       3rd, 4th,       etc.,   but the       1st, 2nd,       4th, 8th, etc.               The

      it in Journ.       of      Anat.     and Phys.,         xxxi.    249 ;        but there is            a
      farther consideration which it leaves                      out of sight.            This      is the
      consideration      of frequency.              Take the partials in fig. 5.                       The
       amplitudes      are    4'2,     8'S,   3"2,     etc.;   but the        first-named           ampli
       tude is traversed only once              in    each period, whilst             the second           is
      traversed     twice, the third three times, and so on.                             The general
      expression     for the whole amplitude traversed in each period is ap,
      i.e., amplitude multiplied            by frequency.          It seems        a right principle
      to   estimate the strength of the reinforcement of each partial in
      terms of the whole amplitude traversed ; and                         if   so, the multiplied
      amplitude, a'p', a"p", etc., will have to bo substituted for the single
      amplitudes a', a", etc., in our last equation.                     Thus we get
                             a'p' logp' + a"p" log p" + a"'p"' log p'" + etc.

tendency       to a decline          in amplitude, which              was exhibited          in    fig. 2.
The centre-of-gravity calculation assumes, in its two simpler                                     forms,
that normally, and apart from resonance, the amplitudes of                                       succes
sive partials would be equal                   :   but we have seen that the series a,
a",  a",    etc.,      is   normally      a   rapidly         declining     series   ;  and in         any
calculation         based on them, some correction                         should be made                for
this.     But when our calculation                    is based upon the series a'p', dp",
d"p",     etc. (i.e., upon amplitude                  multiplied      by frequency), there                 is
no such tendency to rapid decline,                        and our calculation is very much
freer from this risk of error.                     Compare the a series with the                         ap

    Comparing the three methods discussed,                              it   is easy to see           that
Pipping's        method         will always give             a  result somewhat lower                than
Hermann's;             and    that the method just recommended                          will     give       a
result somewhat               higher than Hermann's.                     In     the    present        case
(tig. 5) the difference             between        the three       calculations is not            great.
The first has given 737 v.D.                     ;   the     second    will     be found       to give
732 v.D.     ;   and the third          741 v.D.           And when        the partials involved
are  still higher than             these, the        differences      become more and more
inconsiderable.              But when        the      lowest partials are involved,                    the
differences        arc large       enough        to be of vital importance.                  Another
difficulty, which             I  have    found in practice,             in dealing with              rein
forcements        of the lowest partials, is that when one of the reinforced
partials      is    the      fundamental,          the      results    drawn       from      different
phonograms           of the same vowel seldom                     closely agree      ;  and     I    have
been    led      to conclude that             the       fundamental,          though it may               be
either damped or reinforced by resonance, is much less absolutely
under the control of the resonances, and therefore much less trust
worthy      as    a   criterion of resonance,               than any other partial.               There
are good physiological reasons to account for this                               : for the      genesis
and    period of the fundamental                         is   definitely associated with                the

opening and shutting of the vocal chords, and it is very easy to
conceive that the control of the resonances over vibrations starting
from massive organic           movements      of this kind may be imperfect
and capricious.
    Better than wasting time in discussing             the difficulties, theoreti
cal and practical, thus         seen to arise    in connection with         the lower
partials, is to avoid,       as  far  as possible,   lower partials altogether.
This     can be done by singing the vowel low enough.                    The lowest
 vowel     resonance    yet observed      is an o-resonance        of   o,  216 v.d.,
which I have calculated from           analyses laid before the Royal Society
 of Edinburgh twenty years             ago by Professors Fleeming              Jenkin
 and Ewing. Xext comes            the o-resonance     of  t,  about 280 v.d., and
 of e, about 352 v.d. But          good vowels can be sung by male voices
 at 100 v.d., and sometimes         much lower.       Then we get        a  reinforce
 ment in which       the fundamental, and often the 2nd partial also, are
 not involved.
     Another     advantage   of using phonograms of low pitch is that all
 the resonances, upper      as  well as lower, are displayed in greater detail.
 Imagine a note of 300 v.d., with its partials, entering an articula-
  tory cavity which had       a  proper pitch of 400 v.d., but was capable
  of reinforcing any partials between 300 and                500 v.d.      The only
  partial reinforced in the phonogram would                be the fundamental
 300 v.d.    ;  and we should conclude,         wrongly, that the resonance
 was 300 v.d., instead of 400.           Under like circumstances             a reson
 ance, apparently only affecting the 2nd partial (600 v.d.), might
 really be due either to a resonance of 500 v.d. or to one of 700 v.d.
 But   if the same vowel were sung at 100 v.d., the reinforcements in
 question      would culminate exactly on the 4th, or the 5th, or the
 7th    partial   (400,   or 500,    or 700 v.d.), according           to    the  real
 resonance.
    More important,       and equally common,        is the    case   of two inde
 pendent     resonances    acting simultaneously.        If   a vowel is sung at
 300 v.d. and has two resonances, differing by 300 v.d., it is never
 possible to discern the existence of two separate resonances in the
 analysis, because      the   partials reinforced are always consecutive.
 Let the    resonances,   for example,    be 900 and     1 200   v.d. ; the phono
 grams    will then, of   course, show     in their analysis      great    reinforce
 ments    of the 3rd and 4th partials.         But   there    will  be nothing to

108           Proceedings    of lioi/cd Society of Edinburgh.                    [sess.
show that these two reinforcements are due to two separate reson
ances.    The more natural thing, in the absence of other evidence,
is to see   in   these  two strong partials the evidence              of   a strong
resonance, about      half way between        them (1050      v.d.), reinforcing
both.    Every phonographic investigator has been deceived more                       or
less in this way.      What we really want, in such a case, is to have
a greater   number of partials within the sphere of the resonances,
to show us more clearly where each resonance              culminates     ;   and    the
only way to have more partials is to sing the vowels at a lower
pitch.    In   the instance   just given   there is no probability       of    seeing
any sign     of the doubleness       of the resonance        until   we sing the
 vowel   as  low   as 150 v.d.     Then   the resonance      of 900 v.d. neces
sarily culminates on the 6th partial, and that of 1200 v.d. on                     the
 8th, and there is the 7th partial between, to show, by its want of
 reinforcement, that we have before us the effect of two reinforce
 ments, and not of one.          But in    practice   this is no more than             a
 probability, for it may, and does, happen that the middle partial
 gets reinforced from both sides, and thus comes out              with     a  higher
 strength than that of either of the real culminations.                 It will      be
 best to corroborate     the   principles just started      by actual example,
 and then proceed to consider this problem of the intermediate or
 common     partial in   a more     general   form.     But enough        has been
 already said     to show that      this   problem becomes         less    and    less
 troublesome     the lower the vowel is sung.          If, for  example,      in   the
 instance last supposed, the vowel was sung at 100 v.d., there would
 not be one intermediate partial, but two         ; and  it will be seen shortly
 that the chance of both of these receiving concurrent reinforcement
 from both resonances is slight.         The resonance      culminating on         the
 9th partial (900 v.d.) would in most cases be distinctly marked off
 in  the analysis from that culminating on the 12th partial (1200
 v.d.), by the marked weakness of the 10th or 11th partial, or both.
    For actual     example   let us first compare with fig.        5 the analysis
 of the same vowel, sung at the same time by the same person,                        at
 the much higher pitch of 217 v.d. (fig. 7).             For   the sake of com
 parison the diagrams will continue to be set out on the                        same
 principles as hitherto, though in strictness        the intervals ought to be
 set out as in fig. 0, and    the perpendiculars ought to represent,               not
 simple amplitude (a), but amplitude x frequency (ap).

    In   the place of four strong        high partials (the 6th, 7th, 8th, and
9th), we have          the same resonance now represented only by one
strong low partial, the          3rd; and it is        clear,   from what has been
already said,      that    the former must afford              much    the   more trust
 worthy basis for computing the resonance.
     Next    let us take two of Pipping's               curves     of Swedish       a (not
 unlike Dutch       aa), sung    at two pitches, differing by an octave.                The
 first one, fig.   8, is sung    at 256 v.d.

 the same      vowel was also sung at 128 v.d. (fig. 9).

     The resonance is now, of course, spread out over a wider range of
partials, and is easily seen to consist of two resonances, about                                                          half
an octave apart.
     Next let              us examine the series of nineteen analyses                                      of Dutch aa,

analysis already shown in lig.                                    3    is No.      10 in that series.                     It is
best to consider the series in two parts, viz., Nos.                                               1   to 9, which are

to   d\       and Nos. 10 to 20 (No. 11 is missing), which were

     On inspecting these nine series of partials,                                      it   is   easy to discern             in

        The last column shows the ratio between the resonances.                            I call
    it the radical           ratio, because it seems to me that the distinction
    between        one vowel         and another must be chiefly based upon the
    ratio subsisting          in each vowel between         its several resonances.         This
    conclusion,       at first (1390) deduced a priori from observation of the
    shape of articulations, has derived further support from every set
    of Fourierian          analyses yet published.             Hence my interest in the
    latter subject.

Note       in     this       last table        that      the      vowel      which     is      the    highest
pitched of the ten                is   also the one vowel whose resonances refuse to
be easily evaluated,                 because their effects overlap, and we can discern
but    a   vague      line of demarcation in the phonogram.                                     It    was      for
exactly the same reason that the two highest pitches of Herr voa
Duinen's sung vowels, and they only, were useless for evaluation
of resonances.                 Compare figs.          8    and    9,   and observe that while the
difference          of these two resonances of aa reaches 500 to 800 v.d.,
these three           cases occur where the sung                         pitch (and therefore the
interval between the successive partials)                              is only 264, 297, and 214                5
v.d., respectively,             — being in the           last case certainly less than                half the
difference       between the resonances                     (v.   supra).

Duinen's vowels)                is   naturally the strongest.    It furnishes, indeed,                          a
concrete instance,               just   as striking            as the case already noted to be
theoretically         possible,         where the              intermediate partial, receiving
reinforcement from both resonances,                                 comes out stronger                 in the
analysis than either of the two partials on which the two reson
ances,     if   their effects could be disentangled, would be respectively
seen to culminate.          This striking analysis    displayed graphically is
in   fig. 10    ;   and the relative positions of Herr von Duinen's reson
ances,     as deduced                from the other analyses, are indicated by the

 of 500 to 800 v.d. between the resonances, much more does it arise
 in  one where the difference            is only 230 to 360 v.d.           Such a vowel
 is o.    But    before passing        from aa, two or three minor points may
 be noticed.         Observe in Herr von Duinen's first vowel that the
 same superposition of resonances                 is at work      as  in fig. 10, though
 it fortunately        does    not obscure         the analysis.        The     "common
 partial"     i3   the 7th, — equally         removed      from the 5th, on which
 culminates        the a-resonance,          and from the 9th, on              which     the
 other    culminates.          There      is   concurrent      reinforcement       in this
 case   also   ;  for there is      a   numerical culmination on the common
 partial.      But this culmination             is due    to no     independent reson
 ance ; for no such resonance                shows     any trace of existence        in the
 other analyses.
    Note how much          less variable is the ratio between             the resonances
 than are the resonances             themselves.         The highest resonances           are
seen   in the      5th, 6th, and 8th of Boeke's               spoken vowels,      and   it is
 important to notice that these               (and the 7th) are just those which
 were spoken in the middle of a word, as long vowels between two
 closed consonants.           For explanation of this coincidence, and also
 of the observable         slight general tendency of Herr von Duinen's
 resonances      to rise in pitch as he ascended               the scale,   see  Joum. of
Anai. and Phys.,         vol.   xxxi. pp. 235-7.           Soon after that article was
published, Dr Boeke favoured                 me with     analyses of two phonograms
of Dutch       aa, sung by his son, aged              12.    I was able in both cases
to evaluate the a-resonance, and found it to be four semitones higher
than Dr       Boeke's.     This is quite favourable, so far as it             goes, to the
views of vowel composition put forward in that article.                         But   more
such analyses are needed             :  the smaller the child, the more valuable
would     be the analysis.
    Observations of the articulation of                o have led me to believe         that
it   has    two resonances, differing by about an octave.                     An experi
ment     of Helmholtz          (Sens.     Tone,    p.   60)   points strongly in the
same direction.          Yet     no phonographic observer             has noticed more
than    one resonance         in his analysis.          But the considerations          con
tained in this         paper    readily explain why that is the              case.     In   a
vowel having two          resonances        differing only by about 300 v.d., it is
useless to look for any sign of doubleness                      in the reinforcements
evidenced by the Fourierian                  analysis,    unless    the vowel is sung

     The 4th partial in each of these four analyses                                                             shows      a   palpable
falling-off               in strength                 as       compared               with its neighbours on either
side     ;       and there can be no doubt that this falling-off marks in each
case the gap between                                  an       a-resonance               of 300-400               v.D.         and    a     ft-
resonance of G00-S00 v.d.                                          But when we attempt to evaluate these
resonances more closely,                                  the       problem of the common partial arises
in   a   more imperative form than ever.                                                     The      o   vowel, however low
we may sing                    it,   can hardly have more than two parlials intermediate
to the two culminations.                                            In        three     out       of the four cases above
given,           it   has only one intermediate partial.                                               What       is      to be done
with this one partial in our calculations?                                                        To what extent must we
ascribe              it   to the a-resonance                            and     to the /3-resonance respectively                            !
And how                   comes      it      to pass that, in the                        first of these four analyses,
this middle partial seems to derive great support from both reson
ances, whilst in the third                                     example            it    is    supported          by neither, and
almost vanishes                      ?
     There            is      one point in which                            the common                partial differs from all
others in an analysis                         :   it      is   in being subject to strong influence from

both resonances          at one time.                    All the other partials                    are situated
so   much nearer to the one resonance                              than to the other, that they
may be regarded as being under the sole influence of the former.
The common partial, on the other hand, receives                                           a   stimulus from
each ;   and it must be clearly remembered                                    that these stimuli are
mutually and entirely independent (they are in fact successive, the
one operating        in the intra-velar and                        the other in the extra-velar
cavity of o), and that                  it is     a    matter of pure chance                       whether, in
any phonogram analysed,                     these         two stimulations operate to exag
gerate or to conceal each other in the tabulated numerical strength
of the partial.
     Briefly, it is a question of phase.                             The           partials into which              a
sound is analysed by the Fourierian                              process are simple or pendular
vibrations.         If   one of them enters                      successively         into two vibrating
cavities, each       of which severally                    has power to give reinforcement,
the resultant reinforcement need not be the sum of the two reinforce
ments :  it may be their difference, or it may be anything inter
mediate.    The first result will only follow when the two reinforce
 ments    are precisely            identical in phase                ;       the    second         will follow
 when they are precisely                    opposite            in phase      ;    and    the third          in all
 other  (that is to say, in the great majority of) cases.    On the
 average,  it will be  about  one half the sum of  the   two  several
 reinforcements.
     This view explains the extraordinary fluctuations in the strength
 of the intermediate                   partial, but it helps us very little in the
 problem    of evaluation.                 It   shows us that            if   the intermediate partial
is very strong, and we use                      it for    its   full value in calculating both of
the resonances,          we shall get the a-resonance                              too high and the                /8-
resonance too low, and the radical ratio
                                                                         -

   For making a more exact calculation, two methods suggest them
selves.    When a resonance spreads over several partials, it tends
to spread downwards and upwards            with about    equal force.       There
fore, by regarding the downward falling-off of the o-resonance,                 and
the upward falling-off of the /J-resonance, we may endeavour to
conjecture the real decline in the contrary direction.              But there is
room for much caprice in such a conjecture, and             it would only lead
to any certain improvement of result when the common partial is
manifestly higher or lower than either of the several reinforcements
can be imagined to be.          A   sounder,    though as yet unpractised,
method would be to take from one voice              a  sufficient number of o
analyses to constitute an average which would eliminate the chances
which     cause  the   common      partial   to vary so immensely.              The
number need not be very large,        if the   instances   are  fairly   represen
tative of various grades of its strength and weakness.                   Our four
available instances give an average of 3G8 v.d. for the a-resonance,
of 688 v.d. for the /8-resonance, and of 1-916 for the radical ratio.
But they    are hardly sufficient, either in number or in distribution,
and they do       not   come    from identical      voices,    nor even       from
identical nationalities.

     § 1.  Let    X   and    Y   be two metals,     of which      X  is electrically
positive to      Y  in the Volta-contact series for dry metals, and make
an incomplete circuit          of them     as indicated in the diagram,       with X
and     Y  metallically connected         at an interface     J, and free surfaces
II, KCC        exposed,    with ether or air, or any gas or insulating fluid,
between       them.     Let CC be a movable slab of the Y-metal, resting
frictionlessly on       a  fixed surface    KK   of the same metal.        If  left to
 itself the movable slab would, in virtue of electric attraction, as we
 shall   see,  oscillate on the two sides of the middle position in which
 the whole of its upper surface is opposite to             II.    We shall   suppose
 it held by applied         force   F in any position, or moved, or allowed to
  move, from any one position to any other, at our pleasure.
      § 2. Suppose      now our apparatus        to be given with      no excess of
  either electricity above          the other, and to be insulated in air or
  ether at    a distance from all other bodies great in comparison with
  its own dimensions, and with no electrified body near enough to it
  to produce sensible          electrification through influence.        Every part
  of the X-surface will be found positively and every part of the
  Y-surface negatively electrified, provided each surface                 is of per
  fectly uniform Volta-quality throughout its extent               ; but the electric
  surface-densities of the opposite electrifications will be everywhere
  exceedingly small, except in and near the portions of                  II   and CC
  closely opposed to one another.             Hence,   if the slab is drawn out
   wards, an electric current         will flow  from   II   through the X-metal,
  and will cross the junction            J from X to Y and       flow through     Y  to
   compensate      negative     electricity on the portions of CC passing from
   close opposition to        II.    Our thermodynamic operations,          of which
   we   will   arrange    a   Carnot cycle, are drawing in and out the slab
   CC, sometimes with the whole metal coated with an ideal varnish
   impermeable to heat, and sometimes               with the whole surface        kept

where required for the fulfilment                              of this condition.
  §   3.    Suppose           the    relative          thermo-electric         quality    of the         two
metals      is   such         that, when          a   complete     metallic circuit           is   made of
them, and the two junctions are kept at different temperatures,                                           the
thermo-electric current                     is   (according to the old French                      rule for
bismuth and antimony) "against the alphabet through hot" — that
is, from    Y        to   X   through the hot junction and from                      X   to   Y    through
the cold junction.                  It   is      in this direction for some pairs              X    and    Y
(as, for example,              X    zinc,   Y     gold), of which          X    is   Volta-positive        to
Y, and          is   in the opposite              direction for others          ;    but, by allowing
negative values               to some of the quantities,                   this latter case          is   in
cluded in our supposition                          which       we make      as   a     preliminary         to
avoid circumlocutions.
  §   4.    Consider now the Peltier thermal effect of the current pro
duced      as   in    §
                       2      by drawing the movable slab of Y-metal outwards.
The current               crosses the junction           J      in the same direction               as    tho
natural thermo-electric current in                         a    closed circuit        with
                                                                                         J         the cold
junction    :        and the thermal effect               is   therefore   production of heat at
J;    according to             a   thermodynamic hypothesis which                      I      adopted      as
fulfilled       so far as the siyn of the                  Peltier       effect was concerned,             in

     But       we must now consider, also,               a     quasi-Peltier         effect produced
by electricity crossing                the border between                  air or ether at the sur
face of either metal, and the homogeneous                              metal inside.           "We have

either metal.            It    is    conceivable that        it   may have opposite signs                 for
different metals, or that               itis   essentially of the same sign in all                    ;   but
it   seems to me exceedingly improbable that                           it    is    non-existent, when
I    consider Pellat's and Murray's                      discoveries of change                 of Volta-
surface-potential produced by scratching and by burnishing, without
any change of chemical constitution of the surface layer of                                       a   metal.

Peltier         effect   at
                         J       and the quasi-Peltier                effect at the surfaces               II

in the thermo-electric order stated in                        §   3

  A        number          of preliminary            experiments,        carried on with the
assistance         of     Mr W. Craig Henderson,                    have     shown large          but

same temperature.                    The substitution of carbonic acid gas for air,
and re-introduction                  of air for carbonic acid, seemed to make but
little difference           on the results.            The irregularities        seemed to have
been chiefly due to permanent or sub-permanent changes                                       in the
copper          plate.          At all      events   we   found somewhat more                nearly
regular results with zinc and gold.                              The zinc       plate    used had
never, so far as          I      know, been polished or much disturbed by touch
ing its surface                 since experimented on by Mr Erskiue Murray *
three years ago.                    The     " gold "   was   a   brass   plate gilded for me
about 1859.                It    was one of the two "standard                   gold" plates in
Erskine Murray's experiments, and, so far as                        I     know,    it   has never
been rubbed or polished since 1861.
   We found in                  a   range from 16° C. to 50° C. an augmentation of
Volta-contact difference at rough average rate of about -002 of volt,                        a

zinc in the Volta circuit would    be 799    times the Peltier effect at
the zinc-gold interface, if the preceding figure 800    were exact.
   The sign of the quasi-Peltier   effect for gold-zinc is such that on
the whole   heat is produced by vitreous electricity travelling     from
gold to gold-air frontier, and an equal quantity       of vitreous elec
tricity from air-zinc frontier to zinc   ; and,  on the whole, cold is
produced by   equal electric motions in the opposite    direction.

   The wonderful fact that uranium held in                     the   neighbourhood
of an electrified body          diselec trifles    it  was    first discovered      by
H. BecquereL         Through     the kindness of Prof.           Moissan we have
had a disc of this metal, about        5 cm.     diameter and      A  cm. thickness,
placed at our disposal.
    We made a few preliminary            observations on its diselectrifying
property.      We observed       first the rate of discharge           when   a   body
was charged      to different    potentials.       We found that        the quantity
lost  per half-minute was very far from increasing in simple propor
tion to  the voltage,     from 5 volts up to 2100 volts; the electrified
body being at      a  distance of about        2   cm. from the uranium           disc.

coverer of the effect.        A very interesting        account    will  be found in
 Prof. Becquerel's    paper, which was read to the French Academy of
Sciences on the same evening, curiously enough, as ours was read
before the Royal Society of Edinburgh.]
   These first experiments were made with no screen placed between
the uranium and the charged             body.        We afterwards found that
there was also a discharging effect, though much slower, when the
 uranium was wrapped in tinfoil.              The effect was still observable
 when   an    aluminium      screen    was placed         between     the   uranium,
 wrapped in tinfoil,       and the charged         body.

    To make experiments on the electric equilibrium                           between ura
nium and        a metal     in its neighbourhood, we connected                 au  insulated
horizontal metal disc to the insulated pair of quadrants of au elec
trometer.         We placed the uranium opposite this disc and connected
it and the other          pair of quadrants of the electrometer to sheaths.
The surface of the uranium was parallel to that of the insulated
metal disc, and at a distance               of about       1   cm. from it.        It  was    so
arranged        as   to allow of its easy removal.
    With      a    polished aluminium          disc    as   the   insulated      metal,     and
with     a    similar     piece   of   aluminium         placed    opposite     it in     place
of    the    uranium,       no   deviation from the metallic zero was found
when the           pairs   of quadrants were           insulated from one another.
With      the     uranium opposite         the    insulated polished aluminium,                a
deviation of         - $4   scale-divisions from the metallic zero was found
in about half a minute.                 [Sensibility       of electrometer        140 scale-
divisions per volt.]           After that, the electrometer-readiug remained
steady at this point, which we may call the uranium rays-zero
for the two metals separated                by air which was traversed                by ura
 nium rays.           If, instead    of having the           uranium opposite          to the
aluminium, with only air between                   them,     the uranium was wrapped
in  a piece      taken from the same aluminium                  sheet, and      then   placed
opposite       to the     insulated polished aluminium               disc,    no deviation
was     produced.         Thus    in this    case    the   rays-zero    agreed      with    the
 metallic zero.
    With polished          copper    as   the   insulated metal, and the uranium
 separated       only by air from this copper, there was                   a   deviation      ot
 about     + 10     scale-divisions.        With     the    uranium wrapped           in thin
 sheet    aluminium,          and placed      in position opposite           the   insulated
 copper      disc,    a  deviation     from the        metallic zero of          + 43    scale-
 divisions was produced in two minutes,                       and at the end of that
 time    a steady       state   had   not been reached.
    With      oxidised       copper   as the      insulated      metal,  opposed        to the
 uranium with only air between them,                   a  deviation from the metallic
 zero of about + 25 scale-divisions was produced.
    When         the   uranium,     instead of       being placed       at a distance of
 1   cm.    from the insulated           metal disc,         was   placed     at a distance
 of   2   or    3   mm.,    the   deviation      from     the    metallic    zero    was    the
 same.

    Thesse experiments lead us to infer that two polished         metallic
surfaces connected to the    sheath and the insulated    electrode  of an
electrometer give, when the air between them       is influenced   by the
uranium     rays, a deflexion from the metallic      zero   the  sanio   in
direction, and of about    the same amount,   as when     the two metals
are connected by    a drop of water.   The uranium itself may      be one
of the two metals.

   In     the      course   of his valuable researches                      on the heats of com-
hination and decomposition of                       bodies,     the        late Professor Thomx«
 Andrews,            of Belfast,      arrived       at   the    conclusion              that "   If   three
                                   A is capable of displacing B and C
 metals, A, B, C, be so related that
 from their combinations, and also B capable of displacing C ; then
 the heat developed in the substitution of A for C will be equal to
 that developed in the substitution of A for B, added to that de
 veloped        in    the substitution         of B for C             ;    and a similar rule may
 be applied to any number of metals similarly related."'                                        A tabular
 statement of experimental results is given, and from them illustra
 tions of the above conclusion may be obtained.                                       For example,       let
 A   represent zinc,            B    lead,    and C         copper;          then,      for equivalent
  quantities of the metals, it was found that the number of (gramme-
  water) heat units centigrade developed when zinc displaces copj>er
  is approximately equal to the number developed when zinc dis
  places lead,         added to that obtained when lead displaces                                   copper.
  But, in contact electricity,                the    electromotive force                  between zinc
  and copper is equal               to that between zinc and lead                         added to that
  between lead and copper.                   These facts led Andrews                          to make the
  following        important         remark : — " Electromotive                      forces    which are
  really due to contact of dissimilar bodies are also the very forces
  which cause           heat     when        chemical combination                    ensues,     potential
  energy being converted into kinetic energy by the rushing together
  of the particles under attracting forces."
     Lord Kelvin*            has investigated             the question of the amount of
  heat equivalent           to the work done               by polished parallel plates                      of
  copper and zinc kept metallically connected                               by   a   flexible wire, and
  allowed to attract one another to very small distances,                                     such as the

one ten-millionth        or the one hundred-millionth          of a  centimetre ; and,
in full agreement           with Andrews,         has  pointed out that the heat
equivalent of the work is a portion of the heat of comhination
which would be given out if the two metals                        were   brought into
thorough chemical combination with one another.
    Hitherto, however, few experiments and no measurements                        have
been made to exhibit or determine the heat of combination                      of zinc
with    copper, or of other pairs of solid metals.               Xot only in connec
tion with the theory of contact electricity in particular but generally
in   respect to chemical affinities         it  is important that we should have
some knowledge            in  regard    to this question, and at the request of
 Lord Kelvin        I  have carried out the following           experimental investi
 gation in the Physical Laboratory of the University of Glasgow.
     The method of procedure            was    to dissolve   a   known weight    of an
 alloy, and also, under similar               conditions,   the    same   weight of a
 mixture of the elements which are present in the alloy, the propor
 tions taken being the same as those known to be in the alloy, and
 noting the initial and final temperature in each case.
     Experiments were first made on brass and on its mixed elements
 to ascertain     if  there was a difference in the heat of solution            in the
 two cases    ;  but before      this question could be answered             with cer
 tainty,   a large     number of preliminary            experiments were made to
 determine the most suitable conditions for the work.                      The nature
 and strength of the solvent, and its quantity                   for  a given mass of
 the metals to be treated,          keeping in view the advisability of obtain
 ing   a moderate       range   of thermometric readings, and the necessity
 of minimising          as  far   as   possible     the violence      of the reaction
  between    metals and solvent, had to be settled.                 Bromine (pure, or
 diluted with water or hydrochloric                  acid  solution in various pro
  portions),     chlorine    dissolved      in hydrochloric        acid solution, and
  nitric acid of different strengths, were all tried, and the nitric acid
  was    found     to    be  the    most     suitable.     Excellent results were
 obtained from nitric acid containing 57 percent, of pure acid; its
  density at 15° C. was           l-3.r>5,   and its specific     heat   was taken as
  "634.    This strength of acid           was that used throughout        in the sub
  sequent experiments on zinc and copper                  and on brass.      Different
  kinds of apparatus were used and in different ways, but that finally
  adopted is shown in the figure.

1S97-9S.]    Dr A. Gait     on Heat    of Combination of Metals.             139
     "With regard   to the metals, no difficulty was experienced in dis
solving the    brass and the zinc      ;  indeed the chemical action when
the latter was being dissolved was rather violent, and the evolution
of fumes was      so rapid that     in   the early experiments considerable
trouble was      experienced    in the efforts      to control the fumes and
prevent their escape and consequent loss of heat. On the other
hand the free copper dissolved more slowly, otherwise a more
 dilute nitric acid than that mentioned would have been used. As
 it was, it was found necessary to have the copper always in the
 state of fine filings, prepared by the somewhat laborious process of
 filing down from       the  sample    by means of a very fine file.         The
 brass and the zinc were also used in the form of filings, much
  coarser than those of the copper.            In all   cases the filings of the
  separate elements were made from the same pieces which had been
  partly used in making the alloy.
      The first experiments were made          on a sample of ordinary brass,
   and  I am indebted to the kindness of          Mr W. R. Lang, B.Sc., and
   of  Mr Carrick Anderson, M.A., B.Sc., of              the Chemical    Depart
   ment of the University,     for a  quantitative analysis not only of this
   specimen but of others,      metals     and alloys, used in the course of
   this investigation.    It  was always necessary to know the composi
   tion of the alloy used,   so  that  a   convenient quantity of the mixed
   metals, in the proportions in which they exist in the brass, could
   be weighed out for solution, and a fair comparison             made between
   the heat of solution of this quantity of the alloy and of the same
   weight of the mixed metals.             The brass was found to contain
   64   per cent,   of copper,    32   per   cent,   of zinc,  and   4 per cent,
   of lead.
       The experiments     were   only partially satisfactory, as       a residue
   was always obtained which took             a considerable    time to dissolve.
   It  was small in amount, and was doubtless           due to the lead.    IIow-
   ever, the experiments clearly showed that the heat of solution of
   the alloy was less than the heat         of solution of the mixture.        To
   eliminate the disturbing influence of the lead,            a sample   of brass
    was specially and most      carefully made, from the best commercial
    zinc and copper,   by   Mr M'Phail, brassfounder, Cambridge Street,
    Glasgow.    Its composition     was about      52 per cent,    copper and 48
    per cent. zinc.

   Each experiment was carried out in detail as follows : — One end
of a short length of thin glass tube, T, was closed and then sealed
to a very small glass bulb, B.         Near the point of attachment there
were,  on   opposite   sides,  two oval-shaped         openings in the bulb.
                                  The glass tube was free to move up
                                  and down through one of two holes
                                  bored    through a very short common
                                  cork,    C,   the    downward         movement
                                  being prevented from exceeding six

                                  part of the glass tube.            Special care
                                  being taken to        see   that the bulb was
                                  clean    and dry, it was drawn             down
                                  from the cork about six centimetres
                                  and the cork fixed in a clamp.                The
                                  filings (-5 gramme          was the quantity
                                 always used in each of the brass and
                                 copper and         zinc    experiments)      were
                                 then most carefully inserted into the
                                 bottom of the bulb by one of the open
                                 ings, and the bulb was then drawn up
                                 close to the cork.          Through the other

                                 the bulb and attached tube and ther
                                 mometer was then carefully fixed in
                                 the    neck of a small flask,          F, of thin
                                 glass    containing       the   nitric  acid,    60
                                 cubic centimetres of which were used
                                 in    every one       of these     experiments.

                                 arrangements        at this stage.       Holding
the flask by the lip with three fingers of one hand, it was gently
shaken so   as to give   the acid a rotating motion.            In this way the
flask and contents soon attained o uniform temperature,                 which was
Yery carefully noted, the reading of the thermometer being always

taken by the aid of a magnifying glass.            The bulb was now quickly
plunged to near the bottom of the flask by pushing the glass tube to
which it     was sealed down through the cork, its descent being limited
by the knob on the         tube.   If  the method of pouring the acid on the
filings or of dropping         the filings into the acid had been adopted,        a
 violent action would         have   occurred and it would not have been
possible to prevent the loss of heat due to escape of fumes.              But   the
plan adopted effectually got rid of this difficulty by               the   almost
instantaneous       projection of the bulb containing the filings to the
bottom of the acid.*          It  was very interesting to observe the scour
ing   effect  in the bulb    due to the chemical action ; the       filings were
almost instantly expelled from it by the rapid evolution of gas, the
removal      being facilitated by the existence of the two apertures
already described.          The gentle rotatory motion given to the acid
 was kept up while solution was going on, and when it was com
 plete the thermometer reading was again noted.              The time required
to effect solution was 50 to 55 seconds, and it was observed                  that
complete solution and maximum temperature were reached about
the    same time.       The total weight of the whole apparatus — flask,
cork,    thermometer,      and glass tube with attached bulb, but without
 metals and     acid — was     20 5 grammes,     and its water equivalent was
 taken as    3"5 grammes.        The tabular statement    below gives some of
 the latest results obtained on 29th January last.

   This     difference     approximately represents, in (gramme-water j heat
units Centigrade, the heat of combination of -52 gramme of copper
with     "48 gramme        of zinc.       It will    be noticed that -5 has been used
for w instead of           1,   this being done to make some allowance for
the lower specific          heat of the metals when compared                           with that of
the acid.         An allowance, however, is                        almost        unnecessary,     as   it
has scarcely any influence on the value of the difference                                     betwef-n
the absolute       amounts of heat obtained for the mixture and t!.e
alloy.
    Andrews* obtained                1420 thermal units as the heat of solution
 of one gramme of zinc, and 650 thermal units                                   as the heat    of solu
tion of one gramme of copper, both in diluted nitric acid.                                      Taking
 48 per cent, of the former result,                  and          52 per cent, of the latter,
 to enable a comparison               to be made with my results, the amounts
 are, respectively,        68T6 and           338,       or   a       total of    101 9"6,    which is
 fully four    per cent, greater than my value, 973'4, for the mixture.
 The difference      is,   doubtless,       largely accounted                   for by the presence
of impurities in the metals used, and                                 by the radiation of heat
from the apparatus during the time of solution.
    In chemical reactions in which                   copper            and zinc take         part these
 metals     are usually bivalent            elements,         and        in all such cases their
 relative combining weights are, therefore,                            as G3 to 65,   or about 49-2

     Thus the heat of combination of        "7 gramme   of copper with     -3
gramme of zinc is 34-4 (gramme-water) heat units Centigrade, or
less than half the quantity (76"6) obtained as the heat of combina
tion of -52 gramme of copper with '48 gramme of zinc, the total
weight of metal in each case being one gramme.
    Having obtained these interesting results with       copper and zinc,
Lord Kelvin advised that the experiments should          be repeated    with
other     metals.   Copper and silver were fixed upon, and        I  am in
debted to Messrs Thomas Smith & Son, silversmiths, Queen Street,
Glasgow, for the care and trouble they have taken in making,
from pure silver      and  copper,  two alloys, one of which contained
 216 parts by weight of silver to 63 parts by weight of copper, or
 77'4 per cent, of silver to 22*4 per cent, of copper, these being the
 relative combining proportions of the metals usually observed in
 chemical reactions in which they take part.         The other alloy con
 tained about equal weights of these metals.          Separate   specimens
 of silver   and copper of the same quality as those in the alloys were
 also supplied.
     In  the preliminary experiments on these four specimens,         it was
 found that while all dissolved slowly in nitric acid, and therefore
 required to be in the state of fine filings so as to have solution
 completed in a short time, the silver was particularly slow in this
 respect   ; and it was absolutely necessary to use it in the form of
 exceedingly fine filings.     A   special set of very fine files was used
 in   the making of the filings,   — a very slow and laborious      process.
 It   was also found that the silver dissolved more readily        in fairly
  dilute nitric acid than in stronger acid.        Eepeated tests showed
 that acid of density 1'265 at 15° C. was, perhaps, the best.
     A quantitative  analysis of the first mentioned alloy showed that its
 composition was 76-73 per cent, silver and 23'27 per cent, copper.
 Comparative tests were made with one gramme (-7673 gramme of
 silver mixed with -2327 gramme of copper) of the mixed metals
 and one gramme of the alloy.         Owing to the heat of solution being
 much less than that observed        in the copper-zinc experiments only

    Thus the heat of combination of '7673 gramme                         of silver with
•2327 gramme of copper is 18 (gramme-water) heat                            units Centi
grade.
    But it    has been shown on page 143 that the heat                      of combina
tion of one gramme ('52 gramme copper and '48 gramme of zinc)
of the mixed copper and zinc filings was 76"6 (gramme-water) heat
units Centigrade;         therefore the amount of heat developed in the
formation of the zinc copper alloy is fully four times the amount
evolved in the formation               of the silver-copper alloy, the               metals
being      present in each        case    nearly    in    the   proportion       of their
chemical       equivalents as usually observed              in chemical reactions.
The much higher result for                the   zinc-copper experiments is just
what might be expected              from the fact that in contact electricity
the force of attraction between zinc and copper is greater than that
between silver and copper.
     The other alloy of silver and copper was next tested,                     8 gramme
 of the mixed metals or of the alloy being used.                         The alloy was
 made from exactly equal weights of the metals, but on analysis                            it
 was found to be 51 '62 per cent, silver and 48 '38 per cent, copper.

 nearly in the    ratio of their   usual chemical equivalents than when
 they are in proportions       largely dillerent from this ratio.      Further

equations     which may be taken to be any three of the six                :  (1), (2),
except      the sets A, H,       G) H, B, F; G, F, C.           He   thence      infers,
first, that the eliminant of any independent set of three of the
equations      (1), (2) is (3), and, second, that A must be a factor of
the eliminant.          He states that by actual development the value
of the determinant (3) is found to be 2 A 2, and remarks that                          it
would be interesting to show, d, priori, that A2 is a factor.
    4.  The    d  priori explanation is      as  follows  : — The equation A         = 0
expresses      that the line (4) passes through one or other of the
points in which the conic (5) cuts the line £ = 0. Hence, denoting
the points in which (5) cuts the lines              £ =0, ij = 0,  £
                                                                     = 0 by     P,   P';
Q, Q' ; R, R', the         equations B = 0, C = 0 determine (4)              as one   of
the four lines QR, QR',            Q'R,   Q'R', say QR      ;  the equation       A =0
then makes QR pass through P or P', and in either case the conic
breaks up, and so A2 is a factor of the eliminant.                             In this
explanation it has been assumed,               as  is done by Cayley, that all
zero values of x or y or z are excluded.
    5.  If we      regard (3) as the eliminant of (2), a similar a priori
explanation can be given of the occurrence of A 2 as a factor. The
equation      F=0      expresses that the two points in which (4) cuts the
lines    r)
            = 0,    £ = 0   are   conjugate with       respect   to   (5).      Hence,
denoting by L, M, N the points in which (4) cuts the lines $ = 0,
   = 0, £ = 0, the equations G = 0, H = 0 give L the two conjugates
77
M, N,       so that (4)       touches   (5) at  L.     The equation      F = 0 then
makes      M, N conjugate.          But of two conjugate points        on a tangent
ono must be a point of contact.             Hence      M or N must         be a   point
of contact distinct from           L.    In either    case the conic breaks up,
and    so   A2   is a factor of the eliminant.
    A   similar d      priori explanation of        the occurrence of         A2 as a
factor can be given in the case of each of the systems
                                 B = 0,  C = 0,  F = 0;
                                 B = 0,  C=  0,  G = 0;

     9.      In       the      third    place,   it     may bo shown                   by the geometrical
process           of   §    4    that a2&V-          is
                                                     a           factor of the eliminant.                     In that
section       it      was shown that either                  PQR, or P'QR                  is
                                                                                           a         straight line.
As       we have already seen,                   if   zero values of x or              y    or   z   are excluded
and      PQR           be straight, the conic (5) must break up.                                      But     if   zero
values are not excluded,                        PQR         is   straight       if   any two of the three
                       0. Q,
points           P,         R    coincide.        Now this may happen when a =                                  0     or
h    =   0   or   c   =         Thus,    if     PQR be straight, follows that ale
                                                                                it                            A    = 0.
Exactly the                    same      result       holds           if   P'QR       is   straight.          Hence
a-b2c-       A    2   is
                      a     factor of the eliminant, and since the eliminant must
be of order 12 in the coefficients                               there can be no other factor.
     In      a    similar way          it    can bo shown that the eliminant                             of    ("2)

complete              result of elimination, because they assumo that x, y,                                    z      arc

  1897-98.]         Mr E. J. Nanson                           on a Problem             of Sylvester's.                  155
      11. The elimination                          may readily be effected                       without any pre
  liminary transformation                             as   follows : —
      The equations (1) are
         bz2   +   cy2-         2xyz =       0,    cx1 + az2        - 2yxz = 0 ,        ay2 + bx2        - llixy = 0,
 and from              these we have
8fgJut*!/h* = (bz2 + af-)(cx2 + az2)(ay2 +                                    bx2)
            = ax%bz2 + cy2)2 + by\cx2 +
                                                                             az2)2 +   cz\ay2 +         bx2)
                                                                                                               - iabcx^ifz2
 and therefore
                                 (abc + 2fgh               -a/2- by2 - ch2)x2y2z2               = 0.
  Hence, either A                    = 0 or one of the three, x, y, z, is zero.                                       Now if
 x = 0 the             second and third equations give
                                                 ay2 = 0                         az2 = 0,
  and therefore either a = 0 or y and                                        z are   both zero.           Hence, unless
  x, y,        z are    all     zero we must have
                                     A   =    0, ora          =   0,    or   J = 0,    or c= 0.
  Thus, the elimination of                            x, y, z from (1) leads to
                                                              abc   A    = 0.
      Now          the eliminant                  of three ternary quadrics is of order                                12   in
  the      coefficients.                  Hence,            as    all    possible      alternatives            have     been
  taken into                account,         it follows by symmetry that                            the characteristic
  of the true eliminant must                                be one of the three
                                             abc A3,          rtWA2,             aWA.
      12. That the second of these three forms is the true eliminant
 is easily shown.                        For when           the eliminant of a number of equations
 vanishes, the equations are satisfied by                                         a common          system       of values
 of      the variables.                      But in the present                      case there are eight such
 common systems.                             "When a = 0 the equations                      are satisfied        if
                                         x = 0 and            bz2   + cy2     - 2xyz = 0 ;
 that      is,     there are two systems of values of x,                                    y,
                                                                                            z       which satisfy (1),
 and      these values are the tangential coordinates of the lines                                                 joining
 the point             -q   =   0,
                                 f       =   0    to the intersections of                   $   =   0   with    the conic
  (5).         Similarly,            when         6   =   0   or    c   =    0   we get two systems.                  When

 A    = 0 we also get             two systems, viz., the tangential coordinates                                                of
the two lines represented                    by (5) when A =0.     It is thus seen that
the squares of a, b, c,                   A are each of them a factor of the eliminant.

On the Ellipse-Glissette Elimination Problem. By E. J.
      Nanson. Communicated by Professor Chrystal.

   The problem in question is to determine the                                                      equation of                 the
curve traced            out by any point of an elliptic                                       or hyperbolic                 disc
which     touches          two fixed                 rectangular              axes.           Mechanically                  con
structed figures of different forms of the curve have been given                                                                by
Tait,* who      also showed that the same glissette can be traced either
by means of an ellipse or a hyperbola.                                       If    p,    q are the              coordinate
of the tracing point referred to the axes of the disc                                                           as    axes of
coordinates,     the glissette is clearly the 6 climinant of
                 (./•   -j> cos     6    +   q    sin 0)- = a- cos            -0   +    b- sin "6    \

and Cayley stated that                   it    would be found to be of order                                     S    in   x,    y.
The actual elimination was first performed by Muir,t who obtained
in the first instance               an equation of order 10.                                    On dividing                by   an
extraneous quadratic factor                             a    lengthy          equation of order                        8    was
obtained   ;   and subsequently                        Lord M'Laren                \     verified the                accuracy
of the terms of highest order in this equation.

found.       Let the chief unit vectors of                             <f>   be a,       /?,   y, and its scalars

    There are two kinds of solutions of these equations.
      First. Let    the first factor vanish                    in two of             them, e.g.,
                             S/3p =     0,         Syp =      0,       or        p   =   a.

 Then      the    remaining equation is satisfied            identically,   because   its
 second factor becomes
                             1 -  -^-1

 Thus,     as we might have           seen at once, the lines of zero alteration
 (minima) are the axes of the strain.

    [In   fact, neither the first factors, nor the second              factors,  in the
three   equations,       can   simultaneously vanish : — except in          the special
case when two of gv            g.2, gs  are equal.]

upon the greatest and least of the three values of g, gives the single
vector of maximum displacement: — the other two are minimaxes,
corresponding to cols where a contour line intersects itself.

                                Prof. Tait.
                                            (Read         July    18, 1898.)
     In       the    third Book             of Tlie           Wars       of    Vie   Jetm, Chap.            VIII.
§ 7, we are told that Josephus                                    managed      to save himself and a
companion out of a total of 41 men, the majority                                               of whom had
resolved on self- extermination(to avoid falling into the hands of
Vespasian) provided their leader died with them. The passage is
very ohscure, and in a sense self-contradictory, but it obviously
suggests        deliberate fraud of some kind on Josephus' part.
     " And now,"               said   he,
                                                "   since    it   is resolved among            you that you

makes         a definite hypothesis as to the possible nature of the lot
here spoken of             ;   so that the problem, as we have                         it,    is   really his.
     "Supposons            qu'il ordonna que comptant de                             3   en    3     on tuerait

     Thus stated,              the problem can be                       solved in    a   moment            by the
graphical process of striking out every third,                                  in   succession,       of   a   set
of      41    dots placed round                     a   closed     curve.       When three only                 are
left,    they       will   be found            to be the 35th, 16th, and 31st; and,                              if

the       process    were      continued, they would be exterminated in the
order given.  And any similar question, involving only moderate
numbers, would probably be most easily solved in a similar fashion.
But, suppose the number of companions of Josephus to have been
of the order even of hundreds of thousands only, vastly more                                          if
of billions,         this graphic method would                       involve        immense     risk of
error, besides             being toilsome in the extreme                        ;    and the      wltole
process       would        have    to   be        gone      over again         if   we    wished the
solution for the case in which the total number of men is altered
even by a single unit.
     It   is easy, however, to see that the following                           general statement
gives the solution of             all such problems : —
     Let n     men be          arranged in a ring which                  closes      up its ranks as
individuals are picked out.                   Beginning           anywhere, go continuously
round, picking out each «ith man until                               r only     are left.      Let one
of these be the man who originally occupied the                                 j»th place.      Then,
if   we had begun           with   n+   1    men, one of the              left would have been
the originally (p + m)ih, or                (if
                                              p    +   m>    n   +   1
                                                                     )   the   (p   +   m- n-l )th.
     In other words, provided                     there     are always to be             r   left, their
original positions are each shifted forwards along the closed ring
by m places              for   each addition           of   a    single man to the original
group.
     A     third, but even more simple and suggestive,                                  mode of state
ment may obviously be based on the illustrations which follow.
In    these the          original number of              each man        is   given in black type,
the order in which he              is   struck off,         if   the process be carried out to
the bitter end, in ordinary type.

and   the statement      above is obviously verified.
   To show how rapidly             the results of this process can be extended
to  higher numbers,        I    confine myself to the Josephus              question, a«
regards himself alone, the last man.                  For    the   others, the mode of
procedure is exactly the same.
   Given that the final survivor in                  41, told off by threes, is the
31st, we have
                                       n        last man.
                                      41            31
   The rule just given shows that succeeding                          numbers in these
columns are formed as              follows : — taking only           those which   com

   The value of x which makes the right hand side one or other of
1, and 2, is therefore to be chosen, so we must put x = 6, and the
result is

On     the Nature          of "Palladium Hydrogen."                         By    John
       Shields,     D.Sc, Ph.D.,            Davy-Faraday       Laboratory,        Royal
       Institution,    London.
                                 (Read March 7, 1898.)
   Ever since      the remarkable discovery by Graham in                    1 8«>6   that
palladium possesses         the power of occluding hydrogen gas in large
quantity, various views have              from time to time been put forward
to   explain the       true rjature      of   the phenomenon.           Whilst     some
observers     regard hydrogenised palladium              as an  alloy or solid solu
tion, others again consider          it  to be, or at least to contain,       a definite
chemical      compound        or    hydride.       Those    who hold        the    hitter
opinion, however, are not agreed as to which compound or hydride
is formed,     as  is proved by         the   fact that different formulas          have
been    ascribed    to it.      Graham himself recognised            the    possibility
that a definite chemical compound might be formed,                       for he says
{Researches,     287) that in fully-charged palladium there exists one
equivalent of palladium to 0 772 equivalent of hydrogen, or an
approximation        to single equivalents which            would   be    represented
by the     formula PdH.           His opinion      was, nevertheless,      opposed     to
the idea    of such a definite chemical combination, one of his chief
objections being        that no visible change          is occasioned      to metallic
palladium by its association           with hydrogen.        He regarded the pro
duct simply as an alloy of the volatile metal liydroijenium, in which
the   volatility of the one element            is restrained   by its union with
the    other,   and which        owes     its metallic aspect equally to both
constituents.
    Considerations       of a purely chemical character            have     up to the
 present   time proved insufficient to decide which of these views is
 correct.     The aid of physical methods             has also been invoked, but
 the   results   achieved are not quite            so  satisfactory    as    might     be
 desired.     On certain points, however,           evidence   of  a   fairly conclu
 sive   character     has   been     produced, and before         describing some

electro-chemical attempts which were made to solve this interest
ing problem,            a   short summary of similar attempts, and of the
views of other observers,                   may not be out of place.
  What      is    really required              is   some    criterion which         is   conclusive
either for or against the idea of chemical combination                                     or solid
solution.        Of     course, we may possibly have                   to deal with both of
these    phenomena;               but      a   third       alternative,    namely, that          the
occluded hydrogen                is   simply condensed           or liquefied in the capil
lary pores, seems to be altogether inadmissible.                In support of this
conclusion, we have the                    fact (Mond, Ramsay, and Shields, Phil.
Trans., cxci. 105) that palladium in all its different states of aggre
gation, which presumably differ with respect to the degree of
porosity, always occludes,                  under proper conditions, approximately
the same quantity of hydrogen.                         Again,   if   the occlusion of hydro
gen was merely the liquefaction                      of the gas in the capillary pores,
we should expect                 the heat of occlusion to be identical with the
heat of condensation of hydrogen.                           Although      we do not know the
magnitude of the heat of condensation                          of hydrogen, we can arrive
at the required result in an indirect manner.
     Assuming that the occlusion of hydrogen by finely-divided pal
ladium      is   precisely the same sort of phenomenon as the occlusion
of hydrogen by finely-divided                       platinum, then,       if   in both instances
we were          dealing simply with                 the    liquefaction       of hydrogen, we
would expect              the heat        of occlusion of one gram of hydrogen in
palladium to be identical with the corresponding heat of occlusion
of one gram of hydrogen in platinum.                          The numbers actually found,
however, under comparable conditions (Phil. Tran*., loc. cit.) were
 +46-4K (4640               g   - cal)
                       and + GS.8K (6880        cal) respectively.     g   -
We may therefore reject the hypothesis that the phenomenon       of
occlusion represents                the condensation of the gas in the capillary-
pores of the absorbing substance.
   A    knowledge of the dissociation pressures                           of   a   substance     pro

dissolves    a     gas the       vapour pressure varies continuously, at one and
 the same temperature,                    with the increase          of concentration of the
dissolved        gas.       The pressure-concentration               diagram will in general

 resemble         that shown in fig.            1.    If   we operate     at a constant tem
 perature,         and         start with the solid substance             containing       no gas
 dissolved in            it,   then the pressure        will   also be zero, provided that
 the solid has no               vapour pressure         of its own at the given tempera
 ture.       If    the     gas be now gradually dissolved                  in the solid, the
 pressure         will    rise continuously, as shown in the diagram,                      or vice
 versa   ;    and at any           other constant temperature the pressure                      will
 also vary        with variations of concentration, only at                    a   different rate.
    If,   on the other hand,              a    chemical compound          is   formed on bring-

ing together the solid substance                        and    the gas,   a    totally different
diagram       will       be obtained,      as   shown in fig.     2.    In this      case the   first
introduction             of gas produces         a    small quantity of the compound,
which has           a     perfectly definite vapour pressure              of its own at the
given        constant temperature.                   The pressure      therefore will imme
diately rise to the vapour pressure         (dissociation pressure) of the
compound,           and on admitting more gas more of the compound will
be formed, but the pressure                     will remain unaltered until             the whole
of the solid substance               has been converted           into the compound.             At
this point, indicated by the dotted line, the direction of the iso
thermal, hitherto parallel with the concentration axis, abruptly
changes, and             if    more gas   is   introduced into the system the pressure

 will simply    obey Boyle's law, provided that no further solution of
 the gas takes place and           that no higher compound                  is formed.      At
any other constant            temperature       the horizontal part of the curve
 will   be displaced upwards or downwards, parallel to itself, and the
abrupt change of curvature will again take place at the same con
centration,    C, of     the gas in the solid, that           is,   when the whole of the
solid has been converted into the compound.  On-removing gas from
the system the same diagram will be traced in the reverse order.
   We need not here take account                      of complications which              have
been carefully considered            by Hoitsema (Zeits.             f.   pliysilcal. Cliem.,
xvii.   1).   It will    be sufficient to recognise                 the fact that chemical
                                         Fig.   2.
compounds       are characterised       by    a      constant       dissociation pressure,
that the pressure       abruptly when, and only when, the
                          changes
maximum quantity of the compound has been formed, and that
alteration of temperature            does not affect          the point at which           the
abrupt change of pressure takes place.                   If
                                            solution of the gas takes
place before combination begins, the left-hand end of the horizontal
part of tho diagram may undergo modification but this does not        ;
apply to the right-hand end, where the maximum quantity of the
compound      is   formed.
   These rules have         amply verified experimentally in the

mann,     Ber.    deutseh.    Chem.     GeselL,   ix. 749 ; Isambert, Compt.
rend., vols.   lxvi. and lxx.), etc.
   This criterion was first applied to hydrogenised palladium in
1874 by Troost and Hautefeuille (Ann. chim. phys. (5), ii. 279),
who discovered        that the       pressure-concentration        curve was hori
zontal   or nearly horizontal — i.e.,      there existed a constant         or nearly
constant    dissociation     pressure     over  a   certain range,       from  which
they concluded that the definite compound l'd.,11 was formed, and
that the     excess    of hydrogen over           and    above    that which was
required for the formation of this compound was simply occluded
or dissolved    in the ordinary       way.
    This conclusion, however, has been called in question by Iloitsema
(ZeiU.f. physikal.        Chem.,    xvii.  1), who, from more extended             and
critical investigations      by himself and Kooseboom,               concludes    that
the measurements of the dissociation pressures                furnish no evidence
in favour of the existence            of Pd.,H, or of any definite chemical
compound.         The only interpretation which              he  can     give of the
results   obtained, and this is given under due reserve, is that two
immiscible solid solutions are formed.
    As the results obtained by the Dutch investigators arc extremely
interesting, some of them have               been    reproduced       graphically   in
fig. 3,  which shows how         the pressure    of palladium hydrogen varies
at  different temperatures with the concentration of the hydrogen.
In   the diagram the ordinates represent           the pressure       in centimetres
 of mercury,     whilst   the abscissa? indicate       the number of atoms of
hydrogen associated        with one atom of palladium.
    From a careful study of the diagram,             Hoitsema insists on three
 points, — first,  the middle nearly horizontal            part of the curves is
 not absolutely horizontal         as it ought   to be, and as     it  is in the case
of other diagrams (Andrea?, loc. eit.) ; second, the change of curva
 ture at the right-hand end of the nearly horizontal part is not
 abrupt but very gradual       ;   third, the concentration of the hydrogen
 at the point corresponding to this change                 of curvature dops not
 remain    constant but varies for each             isothermal.        None of the
 criteria, therefore, which are           characteristic of a chemical           com
 pound are fulfilled     in the above diagram.            'With reference to the

     The point       at which       the   change    of curvature      takes    place,
  however,     varies   considerably with the nature of            the   palladium
  employed ; and as        it  is difficult   to know how far the above          con
 clusions are influenced by this fact, and also by the fact that                it is
 no easy matter to determine whether               equilibrium    has or has not
 actually     set in,  it is very desirable that these conclusions should
 be checked      by some independent method.
     It   has   been   deemed      necessary    to go into     some   detail    with
 regard     to the history of this          subject, in order to       be   able   to
 explain precisely the object of the following experiments.
    Before     quitting   this part of the subject, however, it may bo
 mentioned       that there is other independent evidence              against the
 supposed formation of PJ.2H.              Favre (Compf. rend.,      Ixxvii.    649,
 aud    Ixxviii. 1257)    observed    that the heat of occlusion of hydrogen
 by palladium        remains constant throughout            the  whole range       of
 absorption,      and this observation has been            confirmed by Mond,
 Ramsay,      and Shields (Phil. Trans., exci. 105).               If a chemical
 compound, say Pd.2H, were first formed, we should expect to get a
 certain definite evolution of heat per gram of hydrogen combined
 for the hydrogen first admitted, and then, after sufficient hydrogen
 has been     added to form the compound Pd^H (about 630 volumes),
we should expect to find a different value for the heat evolved per
gram of hydrogen           dissolved,   or occluded,    or absorbed.      The fact
that no differentiation         can be observed      militates against    the view
that     Pd2H    is formed, although        the  possible  formation of a com
pound      containing     more    hydrogen — e.g., Pd3H2 or PdH — is not
excluded.        Again,   the same conclusion may be drawn from the
observation       by Dewar (Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin., xxvii.), and by
C. G. Knott (Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin., xii. 181), that the increase in
electrical    resistance   of  a palladium wire is directly proportional to
the increase in the amount of occluded hydrogen.                   Measurements
of the specific gravity and specific heat of hydrogen occluded by
palladium       (Dewar, Trans.       Roy. Soc. Edin., xxvii. 167), likewise
do not lend any support to the             view that the definite compound
Pd2H is formed.
    It   has been suggested        by Dewar (Phil. Mag. (4), xlvii. 334)
that the composition of fully-charged palladium corresponds to the
formula      Pd8H2; and in connection with this view we have the

very significant fact (Mond,                                 Ramsay, and Shields,                         Phil. Trans.,

     If     the             compound Pd^H, were formed, the theoretical value of
the atomic ratio palladium                               :    hydrogen would be                       1   -5.     The ratio
actually found varies between                                     T37 and             1"47, which               moans     that
rather more than the theoretical quantity of hydrogen has been
taken up.                        The excess, which                is       not large, as was the case with
 Troost and Hautcfeuille's                               hypothetical             compound Pd.,TI, might be
 ascribed to                    a    true occlusion, or perhaps                   a   surface         action after the
 formation of the compound Pd3H.,.
     A still                 greater      excess, amounting to about ten per cent., may be
 forced into palladium, which                                    is   charged         electrolytically,             but this
is   immediately given off again on breaking the charging current.
 Increase of pressure                              up to four               or five atmospheres                    does      not
 influence the quantity                             of hydrogen occluded when the charged
 palladium                      is   simply exposed to hydrogen gas.
      Up        to this point, therefore,                        it   still remained uncertain whether
 on the occlusion of hydrogen by palladium                                             a   solid solution or alloy
 was formed, or whether                              a       definite chemical compound was pro
 duced.                     The chief       argument in favour of the formation of the

1S97-9S.]       Dr John Shields on Palladium, Hydrogen.                           177
hypothetical      compound PdjH^             is simply the approximation             of
the above atomic ratios to the theoretical value                1 '5.
   From      the following     considerations it appeared              probable that
the electro-chemical behaviour             of hjdrogenised         palladium would
throw some light on the matter.
   It   is well known       that  if    a concentration        cell be constructed
containing silver, concentrated silver nitrate solution, dilute silver
nitrate solution, silver, the current             will flow in the cell from       the
dilute to the concentrated solution as long as a difference of con
centration remains.         In  the     light    of the modern theory of the
osmotic    production of the current, we may regard the solution of
the silver electrode      in the dilute solution, and             the  deposition of
silver on the other electrode as being due to the osmotic                    pressure
of the    silver ions (which      acts against the          'solution pressure' of
the silver     electrodes), being greater in the concentrated solution
than   in the dilute solution.
   The electromotive force         tt,   in volts, of such      a cell is calculable
from the expression,
where     R represents   the gas-constant          expressed    in electrical units,
T  the absolute temperature,          P   the solution     pressure    of the silver,
p  and p1 the osmotic        pressures      (concentrations) of the dilute and
concentrated      solutions    of silver nitrate, e0 the electro-chemical
unit of quantity      of electricity     — viz., 96540       coulombs,    and ne the
valency of the ions.      Since the solution pressures of both electrodes
are equal,    the above expression becomes
                                       RT                 V
                                              log. nat.
                                                         Pi
   The electromotive force of the cell therefore depends only on the
ratio of the osmotic     pressures     (concentrations) of the silver ions.
    In the same way we may calculate the electromotive force of a
cell, composed of weak amalgam, a solution containing the ions of the
metal forming the amalgam              (salt of the metal), strong amalgam.
The first to call attention to concentration cells composed of amal
 gams was von      Turin (Zeits.  f.   physikal.      Cliem., v. 340),   in  a paper

178          Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.               [skss.
entitled " Gedanken iiber cine vielleicht vorhandene Mbglichkeit,
Molekulargewichte         der Metalle      uach   zwei neuen Methoden          zu
bestimmen."       The same subject was also attacked independently
by G. Meyer         (Zeits. f. physikal.       Cliem., vii. 477), who con
structed concentration cells of zinc, cadmium, lead, tin, copper,
and sodium amalgams.            Knowing the concentrations of          the solu
tions of the metals        in mercury (p and pt) he was able (on the
assumption, which has been confirmed by an independent investi
gation,  that the metals       dissolve in mercury in the atomic state) to
calculate the electromotive force of the cells with the help of the
above formula.         Not only    was the agreement      between    the found
and calculated values of the electromotive force of the cells good,
but the variation with temperature corresponded              with the theory.
    If the hydrogen occluded by palladium              is simply dissolved     or
amalgamated       with the palladium it ought          to be possible    to con
struct a hydrogen concentration cell, composed              of palladium con
taining a small quantity           of hydrogen, an electrolyte       containing
hydrogen ions (i.e., an acid), palladium containing a large quantity
of hydrogen, and       if the calculated electromotive force of such a cell
agreed   with the experimental          value,  then we would have pretty
conclusive evidence that the phenomenon of occlusion was simply
one of solid solution.
    Up  to the present all attempts to work concentration cells             with
different alloys, other than liquid alloys or amalgams, have proved
a  total failure.     The reason of this is not far to seek.          It may be
due to the non-homogeneity of the alloy from the very beginning ;
or, assuming that we           could start with     a perfectly homogeneous
alloy, the moment it is dipped in the electrolyte there                  will  be
either a deposition on the surface of the electrode              of the consti
tuent metal     which      forms the electrolyte, or one of the metals
composing the alloy will be dissolved out of the surface                  of the
electrode,   leaving the other exposed, so that we would practically
get the electromotive        force   of the exposed     metal.   In the case   of
solid alloys diifusion is so slow       as  to be nearly negligible, whereas,
in the    case of    liquid alloys or     amalgams,   it can take   place   with
greater ease.      It  was hoped that       in hydrogenised palladium diffu
sion throughout the mass          would take place with as great ease as in
liquid  amalgams,       and that the above source of difficulty would not

operate    adversely.      It  has been found, however, that diffusion, and
consequently equilibrium,           does not always take place so readily as
was anticipated,     although the difficulties introduced in this way arc
not insuperable.
    Leaving out of account           a  few miscellaneous determinations of
the   electromotive      force of charged       palladium, the only literature
bearing at all    directly or indirectly on the subject is by C. G. Knott
(Proe.    Roy. Soc. Edin., xii. 181) and by M. Thoma (Central Matt f.
Elehiroteehnik,     xi. 131), but      the discussion of the results obtained
by these    observers is reserved for       a later part of this paper.
    Several   different    forms of cell were constructed,         the electrodes
consisting of palladium         wires attached to gold wires, palladium foil
kith new and      foil which      had been    thoroughly ignited in the blow
pipe flame,    palladium       sponge   shrunk on to platinum wires, palla
dium spouge and        foil  electro-deposited    on gold foil, and palladium
black existing as a layer on the surface of mercury electrodes.                 Of
these forms     of electrode one or two call for special mention.              The
palladium sponge        shrunk on platinum (or gold wires) was prepared
in the following way.           The end of a hard glass tube about 8 mm.
in diameter and 80 mm. long, was closed by means of a plaster of
 Paris plug.      A   wire was then pushed           through the plug until it
 projected 10 or 12 mm. into the tube, and held in the axis of the
 tube   until the plaster set.        After drying,     a quantity of palladium
black was introduced           and   rammed    tightly home.      The open end
 was then    attached to     a  Kipp's apparatus       supplying pure hydrogen,
 and a   current of the gas was passed until all the oxygen had been
 removed     and   the palladium         black charged     with hydrogen.       On
 now   igniting the whole tube the hydrogen was driven off, and the
 palladium     black, which decreases many times             in bulk on passing
 into   sponge,   shrunk      itself on to the wire and formed           a  rod of
 sponge.
     Although the electrodes,        consisting of    a layer of palladium black
 on the surface      of mercury, which was connected              by  a  platinum
  wire with the rest of the system, proved quite useless, they gave
 rise  to  other experiments which, although equally useless               for the
  purpose,   are worthy      of being recorded.          Such an electrode     was
  charged   electrolytically     with hydrogen.         A quantity of hydrogen
  which corresponded         with what      was  required to remove        all the

180           Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.               [sess.
oxygen from the palladium black was readily taken up.                 A hissing
noise then occurred, and the palladium disappeared            in the mercury.
Apparently the function of the hydrogen was simply to clean the
layer-of oxide off the surface of the palladium black, which was then
able to dissolve easily      in the mercury.      An attempt     was therefore
made to make a        liquid palladium-hydrogen      amalgam,     but this was
unsuccessful.        Although electrolytic hydrogen was liberated for a
considerable time on the surface of the amalgam, none was absorbed.
In another experiment           a quantity   of palladium     black was      fully
charged     with hydrogen by direct exposure to the gas, and this,
always kept in an atmosphere           of hydrogen, was gradually tipped
over into mercury contained in a bent branch of the tube.                       In
order to prevent overheating, this mercury was kept cold in a bath
 of water, but the bulk of the occluded hydrogen was liberated
 immediately and the rest on standing over night                 It  thus seems
 impossible to prepare        a palladium-hydrogen       amalgam.       Some     of
 the solid palladium       amalgam    obtained by squeezing the excess of
 mercury through wash leather had the approximate composition
 PdHg5.
     A  pair of the above electrodes of known weight which had been
 subjected to      as  nearly as possible   the same treatment,         was then
 placed in dilute sulphuric acid (n, and        in some cases    0'lrc-H2SO4
 was used).      The cell was then connected        by means of a capillary
 syphon tube with a second          cell, containing   a  platinum electrode.
 The function of the divided         cell was simply to separate        the   elec
 trode at which       oxygen was evolved from the cell proper         ;  and care
 was taken to prevent, as far as possible,          the access of air to the
 hydrogenised palladium electrodes,         or to the electrolyte containing
 them.
     In  series   with   the charging     current  was    placed    a   hydrogen
 voltameter,     so that the amount of hydrogen introduced               into the
  palladium     electrodes    could be read off    directly.    Of    course   the
 charging     had to     take place    so  slowly   that   the   whole of the
 hydrogen was absorbed by the palladium.
     In order    to determine the electromotive force of the cell, or the
  potential of either of the electrodes        acainst a normal electrode        —
  viz., zinc in zinc sulphate solution— a modification of FoggendorfTs
  compensation method was adopted,            with   a  capillary electrometer

serving     as    a   zero   instrument.      The capillary electrometer                 used
was Ostwald's form of Lippmann's                instrument, and was sensitive to
two or three         ten-thousandths of       a  volt.     The working         Leelanche
cells were       calibrated     several   time3    daily with      a  normal Carhart
Clark cell.
     In  general, the potential difference           between     the two electrodes,
immediately        after the cell had been set up, was not zero,                     liefore
beginning      an experiment, the electromotive force                 was brought as
nearly as     possible to zero either by re-igniting            the electrodes,        or by
short-circuiting the cell in itself for            a  few days.       In this way          the
electromotive        force at the start could generally be reduced to                  a  few
thousandths        of a volt.
     A   small    measured quantity         of hydrogen was then              introduced
 into one of the electrodes.          With      the different forms of electrode
 this produced       an electromotive force varying from 0'75               -0     83 volt.
 On now adding approximately the same quantity of hydrogen (the
 weight of the electrodes          being approximately equal) to the other
 electrode, the       electromotive force of the cell diminished to nearly
 zero.    Successive additional quantities of hydrogen were now intro
  duced   into this electrode.       In   most cases this produced only slight
  alterations   in the electromotive force of            the cell.     In   general, the
  alteration was       so slight that   it could safely      be considered        as   expe
  rimental    error or want of equilibrium.                Where     a  marked differ
  ence occurred,       this generally disappeared         after the cell was allowed
  to stand   for some time (in certain cases a few days were necessary).
  It  would be very tedious to catalogue the scores of measurements
  made    with the different cells and different electrodes.                 The follow
  ing set has therefore         been selected,      and may be taken as typical
   of those  obtained.
      The electrodes       in this case were      cut from palladium foil which
   had   been used       in former experiments (Phil. Trans., exci. 150),
   and   which was capable of occluding 846 volumes of hydrogen
   when exposed         to the gas under the proper conditions                  (lor.    cit.).
   The dimensions         of the electrodes       were about       30 mm. x 19 mm.
    xO'025     mm.,     and they were        known      as   /?  and    p   respectively.
   /5  weighed      0'2234    g = 0-0186     c.c, whilst       p  weighed       0 2453        g
    = 0-0204 c.c.
       After ignition, the electrodes          were    placed     in   n  - H2S04,         and

    It is to be noted, then, that the           electromotive force of the cell
gradually diminished            on standing and approximated to zero, or at
least the    initial electromotive       force.    The question therefore arises,
whether we ought to consider the                electromotive force of the cell
immediately after the charging current was interrupted, the final
value after standing for a sufficiently long time, or any intermediate
value, as the       true electromotive force.            The choice    of any inter
mediate      value    would be an arbitrary           affair, and   there   is clearly
nothing to recommend             it.  The first value, too, is very liable to be
 affected by au absence            of equilibrium      with   respect  to the      equal
 distribution of the hydrogen throughout the electrode.                       The rate
 at  which hydrogen would diffuse from one surface of the electrode
 to the   interior, or to the other surface, would depend, other things
 being equal, on the concentration gradient of the                  hydrogen in the
 plate.     For    a plate approaching          saturation, therefore, the time
 required     before equilibrium         sets in might be considerable.              The
 final value of the electromotive force of the cell is thus more                  likely
 to be the      correct electromotive force,           and   to be free from such
 incidental     sources of error, to which we          will return  again presently,
  provided we have proof that the relative concentrations of hydro
  gen  in the two electrodes          have not undergone any alteration on
  standing.      It   is   conceivable that equalisation of the              hydrogen
  concentrations      might take place, owing to bad insulation of the
  electrodes.     In  several cases the final concentrations were estimated
  electrolytically by determining           the amount of electrolytic          oxygen
  which was     just necessary to remove the hydrogen, and it was found
  that they had      practically remained unaltered.             The hydrogen con
  tained in p after standing eighteen              hours was determined in this
  way.     It  was found that about           T3  c.c. hydrogen was evolved            in
  the voltameter       before oxygen began          to appear on the electrode         p.
  The amount of hydrogen existing               in   p  must therefore have been
  equal to or    probably, since slight oxidation takes place,            a  little less
  than   T3   c.c.   We have therefore proof that             the concentrations of
  hydrogen     in the      electrode  f3  and   p were     practically unaltered on
  standing eighteen         hours.
     On the assumption that the hydrogen                  occluded   by palladium is
  dissolved in the metal, and that such a cell is to bo treated as a
  concentration      cell,   we can calculate its electromotive force               from

  184            Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                    [stss.
  the above formula.           Taking into account            the   slightly  different
  weights of the electrodes         /3 and   p, the   electromotive force        of the
  cell having the ratio of concentration of the hydrogen in                    the two
  electrodes,     14-40    should be     0  0333 V. at         17°   C.    The   actual
  electromotive force of the cell after standing eighteen                   hours was
 0 0071     V.     This   is a maximum limit, however, and               in all  proba
 bility this electromotive        force would       have    decreased    considerably
 if  the cell had been allowed to stand for a             still longer   period.
     The conclusion to be drawn, then, is that the electromotive                   force
 of such     a   cell is either zero or else closely approximates              to zero.
 In other     words, the potential of a palladium electrode             charged with
 hydrogen and immersed in dilute sulphuric                   acid is independent        of
 the quantity of hydrogen occluded, at any rate, up to near                           the
 point of saturation of the palladium.
     This result     is in  good   agreement     with that obtained by Thoma
 (Centralblatt fur Elelrfrotechnik,            xi.   131).      The potential of a
 palladium wire against zinc in a saturated solution of zinc sulphate,
 was measured        at intervals    during charging, in some cases with             the
 aid of   a  quadrant electrometer,        in others with a galvanometer,            ami
 it  was found that its potential remained constant at about                        0'CS
 Daniell (0'75 V.) until minute bubbles of free hydrogen appeared
 on its surface.           The potential then gradually diminished on
further charging to 0'42 D, but on breaking the charging current
the normal value was recovered.                On removing the hydrogen                by
electrolytic oxygen the normal value was unaffected                     until all    the
hydrogen bad been removed.
     Thoma concludes by saying that,             as  long    as  all the hydrogen       is
absorbed      by the palladium, its position in the electromotive                series
is independent of the amount of absorbed                 hydrogen, and that until
the point of supersaturation           is reached we are not dealing with                a
phenomenon of polarisation at all.                 Supersaturated palladium,           on
the other hand, gradually approaches              the position of zinc the richer
it   is  in hydrogen, but         nevertheless always remains negatively
electrified.

   There       can    be       little doubt that the first gradual diminution
observed       by Knott is due to partial polarisation of the palladium,
and that,      if sufficient time had                  been allowed for diffusion to take
place, a    constant value would have                        been    obtained up to tho point
of supersaturation.
   The gradual         fall in      the    electromotive force of the cell we have
examined (see table) is undoubtedly due to the same cause, and
therefore we are justified                in accepting         the last number of the series
as a    maximum        value, the true electromotive force of the cell, if                               it,
were    possible      to obtain           it,   probably approaching more closely to
zero.
   From the series             of experiments which                  has    just    been described,
and     from    others, the details of which                         have    not been      given,      it
appears,    then, that the electromotive force of                            a     cell, composed      of
palladium containing                a   small quantity of hydrogen, dilute sulphuric
acid (i.e., an       electrolyte containing              II   ions), palladium containing               a
large   quantity of hydrogen,                    is   either zero or^very            nearly   so.      In
any case, the        electromotive force                is   out of all proportion to what
we would       expect      if   the cell        behaved       like   a   true concentration cell,
and therefore        it   remains to be seen what interpretation can be put
on the     result         If   it   be granted that            a     concentration cell        is     not
formed, this would seem to preclude the idea that the hydrogen                                         is

simply dissolved in the palladium, forming a solid solution.                                 The
formation of a definite chemical compound, on the other hand,
would     agree     better with the facts,            for the electromotive              force
would     then be practically              independent of the quantity               of com
pound formed.             The electromotive force of a metal dipped in an
¦electrolyte,     for example,        is practically independent of the quantity
of metal employed.
   Whilst        these electro-chemical experiments would seem to                        indi
cate the formation of a definite chemical compound,                         it still remains
uncertain whether the compound so formed is Pd3H2, or whether                                 it
contains relatively            more      hydrogen    than     is represented          by this
formula.         Experiments at low temperatures,                  such   as those    already
suggested, might throw some light on this question.
  Quite recently a new criterion for determining whether definite
chemical compounds are contained in alloys, and if so what their
                   is,   has been        brought forward by Liebenow
composition                                                                          (Zeits.f.
Elektrochemie, iv. 201).
   This method, which               is   based   on measurements          of the electrical
resistance       of the alloys or on their             temperature coefficients,              is
unlikely to be of any assistance in the                case   of palladium hydrogen,
for, in order to obtain satisfactory results,                 it   would be necessary to
prepare    a    large number of alloys, ranging from pure palladium, on
the one hand, to pure hydrogen on the other                    ;   whereas, so far as we
know at present,          it   is   impossible to introduce          as   much   as one      per
cent, of hydrogen into palladium.

                                Demonstration to Large Classes.
     1.    Apparatus.          — The following              are      needed       :   — Electric       or    lime
light;       standard            hfematinometer             (i.e.,     of     1       cm.     between            the
parallel      sides)          entirely    of glass (for many pigments white glass
flat-sided            stoppered         bottles do perfectly well) ; large direct-
vision        spectroscope                 (Messrs        Hilger),      or        a     Toll en's       carbon-
disulphide glass prism (base 5 inches, refracting angle 45°) ; a
well-stretched dead -white screen to receive the spectrum 4 feet
long at least, about 12 feet from the lantern.
     Following Preyer                  (1), one can with such apparatus first of all
¦iemonstrate                the different         spectroscopic         appearance             according           as
blood is or is not diluted.                       Placing blood newly received from the
slaughter-house (defibrinated blood) in the hoematinometer, we
show that it is opaque in a thick layer, no light passes to the
prism at all, there is no spectrum,                         we can say that the percentage
of HbO.,              is,   at least,      greater than 7'3.                 Dilute          with pure cold
water until            a     faint   gleam of red light appears at the extreme                                   left,
the       concentration              of HbOL,       is    now     not less            than    1   per       cent.   ;
continue the dilution                   until      the first glimmer of extra-linear                        green
appears, the percentage                      is   now about       -9   per cent.        ;    dilute until the
first glimmer of intra-linear                        green      appears, when the percentage
is    now     -7   ;        add to this its own volume of water, making the
percentage             fall    to "35.        From this point further dilution                          caused
progressive faintness of the two bands, until the vanishing point of
the       fainter       (3    band    is just reached when the haemoglobin                                  is    -01
per       cent.   ;     continue        the attenuation until the a band                               is   alone
visible,      at       which         point    the        percentage          can        be    stated        to     be
certainly less than '01 per cent.

    Reduction of the two bands of Hb02 to the one of HbO is &
striking demonstration upon a large scale, but it is not easy to hit
upon      the precise    strength      of the Hb02 solution             that is most
suitable.
    It must   be remembered       that (1) before reduction is attempted the
two bands of the oxidised pigment must be clearly seen by all to be
two, i.e., the intra-linear green must be well marked, and (2) the
resulting single band must not be too faint when it does appear ;
for it must     be borne   in mind that it      is always fainter than either        of
the bands     it replaces.
    To satisfy both       these    conditions,      a percentage       of  "6  will be
found most serviceable.            Add to     a nearly       full haematinometer     of
blood at this dilution        a quarter of a test-tubeful of warm Arn^S,
in   a few seconds the two bands           will fade away into        one.

     1.  Neutral Met-Hmmoglobin. — Of defibrinated                     sheep's  blood
diluted 1*5 times its volume with water, 140 c.c.                     are taken and
wanned to 35° C.j to this add 15 c.c. of a 10 per cent. sol. of potas
sium ferricyanide — the most reliable substance                   for preparing this
pigment in quantity        ; stir, filter.    The band in red and that to the
right of    D  are well  seen ; the others are not to be expected                  in a
wall-spectrum.
     2.  Alkaline Met-Hiemoglobin. — To             140 c.c. of the pigment pre
 pared as above,     add   5 c.c. of NH4HO        ;  stir, filter; three of the four
 bands can be seen.        It  is misleading to describe either of these met-
 haimoglobins as
                      " chocolate coloured "            in solution, as above pre
                                                      ;
 pared, the neutral one is of a dark              port-wine colour, the alkaline
 of a ruby glow in transmitted              light.      Blood, when treated with
 several    other substances       which     form a certain amount of met-
 ha;moglobin (e.g., KC103,          K-permanganate, Amyl nitrite,^Formyl
 aldehyde), does, no doubt, look
                                           " chocolate coloured," but that is
 largely due to the fact that the pigment is present                  in the midst of
 various    proteid precipitates from the blood itself.

Stirling          (2), that acid haematin                   is   incapable       of    reduction          with

     This   is
            a       pigment not well adapted for demonstration on                                     a   large
scale,     owing to the large amount of light cut out by its broad area
of   absorption in the orange, and to the very considerable dimming
of all light to the right of                F.
     5.   Hcemochromogen.              — Of        the     above    solution take              140 c.c. and
dilute     it   to three times its volume, warm to 35°                           C,    and add 15 c.c.
of Am2S, when the dark olive-brown                                solution almost immediately
changes           to a    ruddy tint       ;     it   must        not be        overheated.           Being
ndueed alkali haematin,                    a   very striking           experiment may be per
formed       by oxygenating                some       of   it    and looking          at   its spectrum.
The       two characteristic              bands in the             green have disappeared                  and
given place to that broad indefinite                              region of absorption charac
teristic of the unreduced alkali                           haematin.       If, however, this              area
of dimming be now scrutinised, in                           a    few seconds, towards its right
lorder, the ghost of                  a    dark band will be seen to form, and to
become every moment more                            intense and definite, while                   a   neigh
bouring band             is    found to be forming, though more faintly, to the
left of     it,   and separated from             it    by an interval of clear green light
that had previously been obscured.
     6.   Acid-Himnatoporphyrin.                 — To       100 c.c. of concentrated IT ,S04

     This can only be done in                  a   glass vessel, and the liquids                  must      be
gently      stirred       to prevent any turbidity                     arising either from the
FeS04 or from particles of carbon      some of the blood becomes
                                                             if
charred. If specks of carbon do appear, the whole must be filtered
through asbestos           ;    and   if   too     dark to yield the spectrum,                    must be
diluted only by the addition                       of concentrated H._,S04                 ;   water must
on no account be used.                     This iron-free pigment                is   very stable.          It
is   somewhat        interesting that treatment of blood with this strong
acid develops the halitus sanguinis                         with considerable distinctness.

    This pigment             appears             under various chemical conditions                     ;    thus,
exposure         to the air of a thin layer of dilute blood, or merely corking
dilute blood in a large bottle,                            is sufficient to form some.                     These
solutions first become acid and show this pigment before there is
any alkalinity with putrefaction and reduction of Hb02 to HbO.
    But, as is very well known,                                 this pigment is formed when a
nitrite, even           amyl           nitrite,        or potass, permanganate, or                     KClOj,
or formyl           aldehyde, or                 a     dilute        acid (3), acts upon the blood.
The         last mentioned                is         probably         the     method by which                    met-
haemoglobin  appears in       urine, being produced in it by the
                                                 the
weak acid, for it seems certain that one never finds acid or alkali
haematin in urine, but only Hb02, or HbO, or met-ha?moglobin.
I kept Hb02 in contact with both alkaline and acid urines for
periods varying from thirty-six hours to two months, and only
found alkaline haematin                          in alkaline urine after                   the latter period.
I   never found acid haematin in any urine whatever.                                             Only strong

(carcinoma of kidney),                       I   obtained        a    spectrum which could only be
interpreted by recognising that we had both HbO., and acid met-
haemoglobin          simultaneously present.
      It                      for — (1) Am2S reduced the whole to
           was not acid-hsematin,
HbO ; and (2) dilution with half its volume of water caused the
band in the red to disappear, which is precisely how that band of
met-haemoglobin               behaves            — it    tends        to disappear         in dilute solutions
 with more celerity than any other band in the red.                                             Thus there is
 no doubt this was not a case of met-haemoglobinuria,                                          but merely of
 haematuria         in which            some met-haemoglobin                    was formed by the weak
 acid of the urine acting on the blood, either                                      in   the bladder or          after
 being passed.
      When         met-haemoglobin                    is reduced            by Am2S, it passes through
 the stage of HbO., before                             becoming HbO             :       this has given rise to
                        it         "                                                "

 ever, rather more firmly fixed in   than in Hb02.     When HbO, it
 so produced,    re-oxygenated, only Hb02

 per     i*e,  because met-hsBmoglobin          having been once reduced, cannot
  by oxidation be reconstituted.               I  fully corroborate        those observers
  who lay stress only upon the band in the red in neutral and acid
 solutions— the only ones clinically met with and spectroscopically
 identical.        The band in the red is alone to be relied on                ; and though
 it   disappears        upon dilution,     it  is  stable     compared       with the two
 between         D and E.      In many urines,        I  believe, these two bands are
 really those of HbO.,, which pigment is present along with                        a certain
 amount of met-hsemoglobin              ; for after keeping         such urines for a day
 or two,       all the bands of      met-haemoglobin          become more distinct, as
 though there had been             a progressive      conversion of HbO., into met-
 hsemoglobin.            Such hints     should be borne in mind before                    the
 serious pathological condition of met-haemoglobinuria is diagnosed.
     From the fact that both acid haamatin and met-haemoglobin                       possess
 a band in the red, these pigments may be spectroscopically confused.
The following points distinguish                    them,      apart,   of course,     from
 measuring         the wave-lengths of their bands:               —
     1.    In acid haematin the band in the red is nearer the C line.
    2.     It is usually the denser band of the two.
    3.     It is usually the broader band ; always so in strong solutions.
    4.    In acid haematin there is almost always more yellow-green
light in its spectrum.
    5.    The band in the red of met-haemoglobin                       disappears on re
duction,        that of acid haematin does not.
    6.    Met-haemoglobin
                                  " spontaneously "                          in time with
                                                           decomposes
reduction to HbO            ; acid haematin, being very stable, does not.
    In connection with          met-hsemoglobin,         it is of interest to     note that
it is the pigment present             in   the    material obtained from cases of
haematemesis         ;   of course, quite unaltered blood may be vomited,
hut     if the material       be kept for some time, a band               in   the red  will
develop.
    I  examined several          cases of haematemesis          :  in one   I  was given a
mass of soft,        jelly-like   consistence,     of very dark red, not           " coffee-
              " colour, unmixed with
ground                                       food.     It was   faintly acid, and when
first examined showed the two bands of
                                                             HbO^ but on being put
aside for 18 hours the band in the red appeared.                          Acid haematin
need never be          looked for in the material from haematemesis, since
the acid of the gastric juice is so dilute.                   In confirmation of this,

       IV. — The              Effect of a Riae of Temperature upon Hccmoylobin.
      The temperature of                         a   water-bath was continuously raised from
 10"       C,
         and the solutions of Hb02 taken from it were examined at
intervals.  Up to 40° C. there was no spectroscopic change what
ever         ;   between          40° C. and 55° C. a slight turbidity,                      but no change
in    the bands               ;   between        60° C. and 65° C. increasing turbidity,                     but
no change                  in the bands              ; at    67° C. the bands could           just   be seen
amid general haziness, thus showing that the chemical integrity of
Hb02                 is not       compromised by a temperature                     as    high as 67° C.
On boiling,                   the solution             became       quite   opaque,     and the Hb02
decomposed,                   hiematin being precipitated.

       Reduced HbO is usually made                                  by adding Am2S, with                gentle
heat,            to    a   solution of HbO.,; in a few seconds                          it   gives   the     one
broad band characteristic of the pigment.
       If
      old filtered Am^S be used, no other band appears; but if
freshly made Am.,S be used, an additional band, one in the red at
X610, appears in the course of a week or so, and persists as long as
    the pigment is spectroscopically intact.                                There is no doubt this is
    the band of a pigment, due to the presence                                  of the S, named by
    Lankester (6)                 "      At first I thought it might be
                    sulph-hremoglobin."
    due to the presence of the NH4, but found this view not tenable,
    for sulph-hasmoglobin                    can be prepared by passing pure H.,S through
    diluted            blood, when               a    pigment spectroscopically identical with
    that obtained by Am.2S is formed. Thus, sulph-haemoglobin     is not
    a pigment per #e ; it is reduced hfcmoglobin, so prepared chemically
    that  band in the red (presumably due to S) is present along with
                 a
    the well-known band of HbO. In other words, you cannot have
    tliii>       band in the red without also that of reduced HbO                               ; the   reverse
     is,   of course, not only possible, but more usual.

    1.Carmine. — Waller (7) says, "The discovery of a two-banded
spectrum is not proof positive that Hb02 is the colouring agent,
for carmine gives a very similar spectrum."                                   Dr Waller admits
that they could only be confused upon hurried examination.
    A solution of borax-carmine in standard                                  hsematinometer       was
diluted        till of   the    same transparency as a '3 per cent, solution of
Hb02      ;    it showed the following differences from blood : —
         (1)    Each of     the bands of carmine has its edges more hazy and
                      ill-defined than the blood-bands.
         (2) Carmine lets some blue light through ; Hb02 does not.
         (3) More green light passes in the case of carmine.
         (4) Concentrated            solutions of carmine allow some violet light
                      to pass   ;   blood does not            :   carmine has a narrow zone
                      of green at E.
         (5) The interlinear              green    light     in all strengths of carmine,
                                                              is,
                      deficient, while       it    is   markedly present in the weaker
                      solutions of Hb02,

    2.    Magenta.       — This aniline dye, soluble in water,                      is   in   concen
trated solutions very like HbO or Hb02, of strength greater than
1   per       cent.      On dilution,        the single broad band obscuring the
orange         and yellow regions gives way to two bands, remarkably
similar to those of hsemochromogon.                               The right-hand band in the
case     of the magenta             is,   however, broader, fainter, and farther to
the right        in the     green     than        is   the corresponding band of hsemo-
chromogen,            while the left-hand band                is    rather broader than the left
of the two of the blood-pigment.
    3.    Roseine and Fuchsine are like magenta                          ;   they remind one, at
a certain degree of dilution, of hsemochromogen.                                 The appearance,
however,         is   hardly that of two bands                ;   it   would be more accurately
described         by saying that there                 is   one very broad absorption area,
whose darkest portion corresponds                           in position    to the left-hand band

emerging from               a haze      is   in marked contrast to the very sharply
defined bands of hsemochromogen.

           (1) Both bands of coccus are broader than the correspond
                  ing blood-bands.
           (2) They thus invade more of the green region, of which
                  there is much less than in the case of Hb02, for the
                       bands of coccus                  are    far more ill-defined              on their
                       edges.
           (3) Compared with the blood-bands, there is not that rela
                 tive difference of depth that exists between the latter.
           (4) The bands of coccus,                       compared with each other, are,
                  on a first glance,                      equally broad;              if there    is    any
                       difference of width between them (the haziness of
                       their edges makes this very difficult of estimation),
                       it    is   the    left-hand            one      that is the        broader — the
                       opposite         of which holds good in the case of HbO,.

                       farther into the green region than does that of                                 HbO,
                       which does not cut out all the green rays.

                  than    the case with HbO.

no blue    light is transmitted in either         case.      Upon diluting saffranine
all the blue light passes, and the band locates itself much more to
the right,     so as to     resemble       the spectrum of urinary             or biliary
pigment.
     8. Eosine.  — In dilute solution this              gives a band in the green at
b   very similar to the fourth and most                    distinct   band of alkaline
haemato porphyrin.

     Quite fresh blood-stains,       e.g.,   before drying upon a handkerchief,
yield with transmitted          light the spectrum of Ilb02.                Stains more
 than an hour old, and therefore quite dry, yield two bands; but if
 broicn, give no bands, as haematin must be soluble and transparent
 to do   this.   Blood-stained filter-paper fourteen days old, when dry,
 gave the HbO., spectrum on the edge of the paper ; after four
 months, and only after being wotted, that of acid met-lwinoglobin.

     One must be prepared to                find, even when           the  spectrum of
 circulating blood can be obtained, only one band, as indicating
 such     a thickness     of blood      that     the     opacity allows      of the ap
  pearance of only one band.             If, for     instance,    the hand be held up
  before a powerful light, or to the sun at noon, one can see by the
  spectroscope,    directed to the crimson glow between the fingers,                      a
  one- banded spectrum as of HbO., greater than                  1 per cent. ;  similarly,
  light which has passed tlirough the human pinna, or been reflected
  from the nail, or from the rabbit's fundus oculi, yields the same
  spectrum.      If  one    uses    the     semitransparent          ear  of   an   albino
  rabbit, the blood sheet is just thin enough to yield the two-handed
   spectrum,    which fades into the one-handed spectrum of the re
   duced pigment      if  one constricts the base of the ear for 30".                    A
   two-banded     spectrum can be seen if the frog's web (prepared as
   for microscopic     examination) be interposed between the light and
   a spectroscope.      If a ligature be now tightly tied round the thigh,

one cannot got the two bands to give place to the one band, even
after three hours — a most striking                  additional    proof    of the    great
relative difference in deoxidising                energy possessed,         on    the   one
hand, by amphibian (cold-blooded) living tissue, and on the other,
by mammalian (warm-blooded) tissue.
    It  demonstrates       the very much more active                  deoxidative kata-
bolism of the rabbit's            tissues     compared with the           frog's.    Since
making these observations,              I  have seen Yeo's paper (8) upon the
respiration of cardiac muscle, in which he finds, in the beating frog-
heart, fresh mammalian blood perfused is reduced in from 30-55',
showing, precisely as one would expect, the much more                            energetic
 katabolism in a frog's heart than in               a  frog's leg.

                              Htemoglobin Derivatives.
     The following pigments yield the blue colour of this test: —
     Oxyhemoglobin,          even     in     very     dilute  solution,     neutral     and
 alkaline     met-hremoglobin,           acid    hvmatin,      alkali    ha;matin,      and
 CO-HbO.
     The following do not yield the blue colour : —
     Reduced HbO, luemochromogen, acid ha?matoporphyrin, the                             red
 ally of uro-haematoporphyrin.                This latter list   is interesting in that
 they are all more or less reduction-products of HbO.,.
     Using this test to discover the minimal quantity of Hh02 which
it could detect,       I  find that it still yields a blue with so small an
 amount    as 5   minims of blood, diffused through 750 c.c. of water                        ;
 this represents      -04   per cent, of blood, which corresponds to "0050
 per cent, of HbO., in the water.
     With    the   spectroscope       I   noticed that       on    diluting    down      one
 could detect       -625    c.c.  in   1100     c.c.   of water, and "3125          c.c.   in
  130(1 c.c.  of water, although at this point the                  fi band could      only
 be viewed obliquely:            at  •312.")   c.c. in    1500 of water the /? hand
 had vanished, i.e., the spectrum had just become                        atypical.     This
  represents    -02 per cent, of blood, which is equivalent to '0028 per
 cent, of HbO., in the urine           ;  this figure is very nearly Preyer's             for
 the   minimum visibility of TlbO.,,              viz., -003 per cent.          Since     the

'0056 per cent, by the guiac method, the instrumental                                                is twice as
delicate a method as the chemical.
     The spectroscope                   could thus detect a loss of '3 c.c. of blood by
the urine per twenty-four                       hours.
                                    X. — Urobilin and Bilirubin.
     I    believe the spectroscope                      may be of service, clinically, in                      cases
of suspected                choluria, especially in those in which Gmelin's                                        re
action gives negative results.                            In    urine, normal               as to    its depth of
colour, its          yellow pigment, urobilin, yields                           no absorption spectrum,
nor, indeed,                does an        alcoholic solution of urobilin                           (prepared by
Mlfunn's method), if only no deeper than the tint of normal
urine. With normal urine there is some haziness in the region of
the      F     line, but it by no means amounts to                               a band.            Urine     evapo
rated to one-fifth                  its bulk, cooled             and filtered from urates,                        does
yield the broad, familiar                          band extending darkly over the                            F line
and       shading away into the green.                           Jfow, it            is quite true that the
absorption-spectrum                      of     bile from            the    greenish-yellow              pigment
bilirubin            is,   at   a   certain degree              of dilution,            remarkably similar
to       that of urobilin,              and under certain conditions would                               be    prac
tically indistinguishable                     from       it
                                                          ;    nevertheless,         I       believe that in so
far as pathological                  urines are concerned,                  we tan say whether the
abnormal             pigmentation             is   due to an excessive                      amount of urobilin
or to the presence                      of bilirubin.           For, first of               all, from the fact
that unless                specially concentrated or chemically treated,                                     normal
urine gives                no spectroscopic             evidence       of urobilin,           if    one sees      in   a
urine        a      band at     F,      and no other bands, the presumption                                  is   that
that band            is    due to bile-pigment.                 All    doubt          is,   of course, dispelled
if    this urine also yields                    Gmelin's test, for urobilin                        does not give
 the play of                colours.     I         am    not forgetting              that in         choluria the
urobilin may be itself increased,                              but   as    it   is   only in highly febrile
urines          that the urobilin band spontaneously appears (and when                                                 it
does,          is usually accompanied by bands more to the left),     am                                      I
 inclined to believe that the band at                                F     in choluric urine            is    almost
 entirely due to bilirubin.                         If    this increase           of urobilin in choluria
 be      anything like              a    common occurrence,                     it    tends     to confirm the
 contention            emphasised          in   a    former paper (9), that urinary pigment
is       not     merely altered and reabsorbed                             intestinal biliary            pigment,

 for in by far       the   greater     number of cases of choluria there                  is
 diminution     of bile entering the intestine, which should lead                  to leas
 (and not more) urobilin, if the latter were derived from any                          pig
 ment in the intestine.           I   do not here raise the question of                the
 genetic    relationship     of biliary      to urinary      pigment, but shall         be
 content to point out that even with the pocket spectroscope,                          the
 presence of bile-pigment          in urine (even         when not giving Gmelin's
 test) may be detected.
    I  examined     a  number of urines in cases of undoubted jaundice,
 with and without carcinoma of liver, none of which gave Gmelin's
 test; and by comparing them spectroscopically with                          urine    con
 centrated to their tint,        I   was able      to be certain that        it was not
 urobilin that was the cause of their abnormal pigmentation.
    As   to the band at       F  in these      cases,   close scrutiny reveals       some
 degree of difference      ; for, taking bilious and non-bilious urines                  of
 the same depth of colour to the eye, we notice —
    1.  The    left   margin     of    the    broad band        at  F in    the  case    of
urobilin is much more hazy than in the case of bilirubin.
    2.  It  does not extend so near to the red side as does the latter.
    3.  Very     much more         blue-violet       light   passes   in   the   case    of
 urobilin than in that of bilirubin            ; i.e.,   while urobilin shows        more
blue,   bilirubin shows      more green.
    4.  The darkest zone of the bilirubin band is slightly nearer                        to
 the left than that of the urobilin band.
    In other words, urine with             a little bile-pigment       resembles, both
to the     eye and    with    the    spectroscope,        non-bilious urine with        an
excessive     amount of urobilin           : given two urines,         unsophisticated
in any way, both with bands at F, the one in which the band                               is
darker will probably contain bile pigment,                  for the urinary pigment,
in order to yield       so  dark a band, would either have to be                 present
to   a  most unusual amount              (such    as   is only    reached    by   certain
diseased     urines), or have to be associated                with   a degree    of   con
centration much higher than we are supposing to exist.
   The spectroscope        might bo employed to distinguish the urine                    in
carbolic-acid poisoning (carboluria) from that in choluria, for the
former shows a distinct absorption in the orange region, coupled
with   a  dimming of the entire green, features absent from the                     urine
when containing either biliary or urinary pigment.

    I   had the opportunity                of studying the urine in the rare disease,
melanuria (melanotic sarcoma).      Examined without dilution the
brown-black fluid cut out all light except some red, and hence had
no characteristic             appearance        ;   on dilution, it became so like urine
with bile or carbolic acid, that the spectroscope                               cannot be said, in
such a case, to be of much service.
    Glacial acetic acid deepened                         the tint of the band in the dilute

    I   was led to look alittle into this pigment from finding that
defibrinated blood, which has been shaken up in a 1 \ litre vessel full
of pure CO., gas, no longer gives the two bands of Hb02, and is of

some     defibrinated blood for some minutes, so as to he thoroughly
mixed        with       it,   fully      reduced          HbO      can     be seen,       though            not
without trouble,              on        account of         the    difficulty     of preventing re-
oxygenation in our attempt to examine it.                                  The following               device
succeeded.          A    stream         of the gas was made to bubble up through
the     blood in    a   hasrnatinometer,             and the froth examined in                     a   strong
light.       A    very beautiful phenomenon was seen                            :   an intact bubble
gave    single-banded spectrum, but the instant
         a                                                                    it    had   burst        it   was
oxidised, and yielded the two bands of IlbO.,.                                  The pellicle of the
bubble was          thin      enough      to allow sullicient light             to pass to form               a
spectrum,         while       the       bubble bursting           upon the glass gave for                     a
moment       a    smear of oxidised pigment before                       it   drained itself down
into the      fluid below.               The rapidity of           the oxygenation             was very
notable.

stream of C02 gas.                 The dilution had destroyed the red corpuscles by
their having imbibed water and hurst, so that under the microscope
not   red disc was to be seen. At the end of

 unite with Hb02, and yet                            doex     unite with the physiologically                          intact
 disc,      it    can only unite with some constituent of the corpuscle                                               other
 than the pigmentary.                             To this extent         I   would seem to agree                       with
 Bohr (10); though                        I   could not say the union was with the                                   globin
 any more than with the ha>matin, seeing that C02 effects no change
 upon luumoglobin in solution. In other words, CO., effects changes
 of reduction only upon blood.                                   What            is noteworthy               is the ex
 tremely unstable or loose character of this compound of CO., with
 the red disc, which can in an instant be reoxidised, i.e.,                                         0       can displace
 the CO;, very readily.                           The artificial HbO, made by reducing HbOj
 with Am.,S,              is,   in comparison,               quite "table, for          if   reoxidised,        it   shows
 the two bands, and then they fade away to the one again.
      It        is,    in short, easy               to   preserve        the        Ain.,S-HbO               intact      for
 months,           the CO^TIbO

I    am very much inclined to regard the union of C02 with the discs
as    not     a       chemical one, but much more of the nature of                                          a   physical,
interstitial, or intermolecular one in the meshes of the protoplasm
of the intact red corpuscle, — HbO., having no chemical affinity for
C02, while              it   has   a   very strong one for 0.                           This     state of matters
has       a   most       direct and important bearing upon the needs of                                                  the
body       as regards            these gases, seeing that the red corpuscle                                  of   arterial
blood must be able to carry its burden of respiratory oxygen                                                         to the
remotest              recesses of the tissues, and not                       till   then give           it   up to       the
lymph, whereas the red corpuscle of venous                                              blood must be                ready
to    part with its dissociable                      C02      as soon as         it     has reached             the pul
monary capillaries.

in large amount becomes                   changed     first to reduced HbO and then
(after five months) to alkali-haematin.                       As to its power of resisting
reduction         by Anx,S, the point of importance seems to be whether
the    CO-HbO is or is not freshly                made.       Some fresh CO-IIbO with
|   of its volume             of fresh Am.,S was put up on 18th                      February,
and after three months                    was   still CO-HbO, unreduced, whereas
some ten        days' old pigment with             \  of its volume of Am.,S, became
in twenty-eight             days reduced to hajmochromogen.                  The statement
that    CO-HbO is           a very stable pigment is           fully justified.

                             their Resistance to Putrefaction,
     In February 1895              I  examined     a  number of test-tube preparations
 of   dilute ("25 p.c.) solutions of dog's HbO., which had been hermeti
 cally sealed up by Professor M'Kendrick in 1888.                            Into them had
 been    put bits of living tissue to                see   how these would affect            tho
 pigment ; the results on that point                     are too discordant         to warrant
  generalisation,        but    the condition of the tubes            after seven years is
 interesting.          The HbO., had originally, of course, not been heated,
  but the     air above it must have been pretty well sterilised by tho
  heat necessary          to fuse the glass of the tube.
  Tube 1,    in  1888 HbOa + portion of eye, result in 1895 HbO, result in 1897 HbO.

      Of these seven, four had become                    reduced,    and of these four two
  had no         tissue    in them, while         two tubes, which after nine years
   were     still HbO., had skin in them              ;  thus   I do not think the results
   as  to tissue        action are of much value, but the significant                       fact
   remains that          a    dilute     solution   of mammalian Hb02,               practically
   sterilised,      can    remain       for   nine    years chemically        in statu quo.
   Further, those          that were HbO in 1895 were HbO in 1897; thus
   the    reduced       pigment in dilute          antiseptic      solution is     as  stable   a
   form as the oxidised

HbO...       Thus—
    Sheep's     or ox's blood in a corked bottle, even when not quite
full, loses in about twenty-four hours its crimson hue, and                  become?
claret coloured,      while in    a few hours more the spectroscope             show?
it  to be     IlbO.    This putrefaction-HbO           is very easily re-oxidised
into Hb02, i.e., the pigment itself has not become decomposed,                       its
chemical integrity lias not been compromised,                although it has      been
reduced      in and by     decomposing      blood.       The pigment cannot          be
said    to be decomposed           so long as     the   IlbO    can become       HblL
again.      After    5 months,     corked-up blood is alkaline, the           pigment
heemochromogen,          so that it must      have    passed     through the      stage
of alkali-haematin.
    The pigment in decomposing             blood probably oscillates         between
these two states according to the amount of available oxygen pre
sent, for decomposing          sheep's blood 3 years        old mixed with H.,0
in  a  hannatinornetor (for it is too opaque when undiluted), showed
the band of alkali-hsematin ; probably the hicmochromogen had
been oxidised       in the process.
    A dilute solution       (-3 p.c.) of HbO., in a test-tube        loses its bright
ness on the fourth or fifth day, becoming slightly                 turbid, of    a pale
 rusty-brown       colour,    slightly   acid    in   reaction,     and yields      the
spectrum of met-haemoglobin              ; at the      end    of   3   weeks it     had
 become      HbO, which, however,           was easily oxidised         to  HbO.,     on
 being shaken with air.              Thus, while    a dilute solution of the        pig
 ment     of    blood passes       through    an   intermediate       stage   of   met-
 hcemoglobin,      the pigment in blood itself does not, but is reduced
 as its   first change — a result evidently due to the development                     in
 decomposing        blood of some reducing materials which                 are absent
 from weak, watery solutions of the pigment alone.
    I  found that thymol, as Yeo (8) had found phenol, delayed                       the
 appearance of these reducing decomposition-products in blood.

     By the seventeenth day two specimens of it — one with and
one     without thymol — had become of the most beautiful clear ijn'en
colour, the       reaction was     alkaline, and there         was  no precipitate.
It still showed the two characteristic bands in                 the green, but had
in addition a broad area of absorption in the red (to which it owed
its green colour).
     The pure solution at the end of two years was yellowish, with
the     faintest possible band at F.           The solution with thymol had
become       alkali-hoematin at the end of two years, and was still the
*ame      at the     end of three    ; it had     lost   a   great deal  of its red
colour.

    In connection with           these    pigments    under observation for        a very
long time, it is noteworthy that in several instances, after reduction
had     done    its work,      there    was formed a precipitate of something
reddish,      while      something       yellowish    and   transparent       went     into
solution.       This yellowish liquid was noticed              in dilute solution?        of

duced solutions of HbO., or its allies.
    I venture       to    think    we have      here  a test-tube    version of      what

first   a   reduction of        the    'effete'   haemoglobin,    followed by        a de
composition of it into two portions, an iron-containing                       compound
that can be demonstrated in the liver-cells, and iron-free substances

arrived      at   in that     paper.     He    says,
                                                        " A   body very closely re
sembling        urobilin     may by prolonged and complete                  reduction be
produced        from haematin        in acid solution;"          and "incomplete         re
duction       furnishes      a   body also      resembling       urobilin,     but  which
immediately          reverts to the state of uro-hoematoporphyrin."                   This
latter    is    an    orange    pigment,      and   would       "resemble       urobilin."
M'Munn thinks that its             red  ally and it itself     are progressive      stages
in reduction         from    hrematin.      Eichholz     did not evidently         stop at
any stage       till he reached       one    resembling urobilin, but it is per
fectly possible that,         even artificially,    one passes through the stage
of a-haematoporphyrin.*               In   the   body, if this pigmentary kata-
bilism to urobilin be disturbed or incomplete, the red or orange
(a- or /3-) haematoporphyrin             may appear        in the urine      ;  sulphonal
seeming to have a powerful               influence in this direction in the case
of the red       or a pigment.

    Under this head           I  made a large number of observations from
 time to time,        but owing      to the very great        mechanic     il dilficulties
 of   examining the blood soon               enough,     I  do not fool justified        in
reporting       on any except the following          : —
    Blood from the internal jugular of a dog, chloroformed until
 respiration      had ceased, gave the onc-banded IlbO very rapidly
 changing to HbO., upon oxidation.
    A   large dog, chloroformed           till respiration      ceased,   yielded from
 int. jugular      HbO, from left ventricle HbO.,.
    A   cat, suddenly       killed by   a   blow on the head, gave with blood
 of right    ventricle HbO, with blood of left ventricle HbO,.
    In    a    month-old      rabbit,   chloroformed        till respiration       ceased,
 blood of right ventricle was           HbO with       one band rapidly becoming
 two on oxidation         ; from internal jugular HbO also.
     So far as      I  am entitled    to form an opinion,         I  confirm M'Munn
 in saying,      " the   blood in the right side of the heart and in the
  veins is reduced       as soon as the animal has ceased              to breathe,     but

after death it would be difficult            to say, but      I  find one experiment
upon the point.
    A  cat was     killed by    a blow on the head, and the               body lay for
eighteen    hours, when blood from the left ventricle gave the single
band of HbO very easily oxidised                  ;  blood from the right auricle
gave   HbO not       so easily oxidised.
          On the Crystallisation           of HbOt of Rodents' Blood.
     For  the last three years         I  have     kept crystals of HbO., under
observation.         Some were from the rat and were                  mounted both in
water and in balsam (by Stein's method, defibrinated blood mixed
with balsam).          It is interesting       that HbO._, will not crystallise in
plasma    ; the blood needs to be defibrinated, and the red corpuscles
must give up their HbO., before crystallisation can be depended on.
The relation of this fact to the needs of the circulation                        is too
obvious to require mention.              Whilst watching the familiar crystal
lisation in water of the HbO., from the rat,                   I  noticed that a con
siderable number of the spicules, whether singly or in stars, were
 colourless  ;   in every other respect they              resembled     by transmitted
 light their bright crimson neighbours.
     There were more colourless crystals                  in the water preparation
 than in the balsam         —  a fact evidently related to the higher solu
 bility of Hb02 in water.            It was also noticed that the water round
 about these colourless groups was stained deep red.                        What were
 these colourless crystals         1   It  has been suggested           they were crys
 tallised    proteid-globin ; but this involves the breaking up of
  HbO.,, and the pigmentary portion — the haematin — is not soluble
  in water.       If they were still HbO.,, colourless HbO., is             a substance
  unknown       to physiological      chemistry.         At the     same time, there     is
  no other term         by which they can be alluded to                than " colourless
  haemoglobin,"       or the   chromogen of HbO.,.              More recently,   I   have
  observed      HbO., crystals in balsam from the                    guinea-pig become
                               '             '
  within three        weeks      bleached       to   this   colourless condition      ;  it
  certainly looks like       a   reduction of the HbO., to colourless chromo
  gen,   probably effected         by changes       in  the   defibrinated blood sur
   rounding the crystals.
      On the other hand, why should not all similarly formed crystals
   of Hb0o become similarly altered? — tlie majority do not.                     I    have

 preparations       in   balsam      three     years   old showing crimson crystals
 both     from rat and guinea-pig.                  Such preparations still give the
two bands of          HbO., in the microspectroscope.                  (I  may here     men
tion that haemin         crystals do not do so.)
    It  seems evident that there are two fundamental forms of HbO.,
crystals      in the rat — (1)        the   elongated     rhomboidal       prism; (2) the
thin     flat plate    :  if   the former tapers          at both ends, we have          the
acicular;       if only    at one end,          the   clavate.     The plate may be         a
retjular     hexagon,        as   Halliburton (13) found,           so   that this form is
not     absolutely       confined       to    squirrels'   blood,     or   it  may    be  an
irregular       hexagon,        a  pentagon, or other polygon (size of rat's
regular hexagons is from "002 to -003 mm.).
    I  noticed the formation,              as   it were, of certain of the flat plate
crystals (regular         hexagons       included), by the lateral coalescence of
 radially disposed rows of granules, or of acicular or clavate. crystals
disposed       in one plane        ;   while, after three         weeks,     I saw certain
apparently        homogeneous crystal-plates breaking                    up into rows of
grannies,      radially     disposed,      or into radiating         acicular or     clavate
crystals.        Some      plates    broke up into radiating feathery forms.*
In    the    cases   in which        the    thin flat    plate was formed at first an
wch, i.e., quite homogeneously,                  it did not break up radially, but
 tracked into a number of polygonal areas, like a mosaic.                           Some of
 these    thin flat regular hexagons are after three years quite intact.
 Further,      I  corroborate Halliburton that the regular hexagons are
 formed      near the periphery of the preparation, i.e., where drying
 went on most vigorously             — the rapidity of          loss of moisture being
 evidently a factor in determining the size and details of form of                          a
 crystal.
    Guinea-pigs' blood mixed with balsam                       sometimes       yields some
 very large       tetrahedra ('05 mm. side) of a bright crimson colour.
 Occasionally one finds aborted forms — thick triangular plates with
 upward sloping          edges ('04        mm.     side)
                                                          — evidently the foundation
 upon which the pyramid was to have been built.                             Some of these
 thick plates were          yellow, not red         ; and   after three weeks became
 eroded     on the edges, which              were    previously particularly         sharply
 cut.
    *
       This breaking up of crystals into simpler elements               I have also seen in
 very old cholesterine      crystals.

Note on the Effect of Mixed Diet as Regards Salivary
       Digestion.          By W. Q. Aitchison Robertson, M.D.,
       D.Sc, F.R.C.P.E.
                                (Read  July 4, 1898.)
    The following research was made with the object of determining
whether the digestion of starch is affected favourably or unfavour
ably by its admixture with other articles of            food.
    As regards the quantity of saliva secreted per twenty-four hours,
this is stated to vary from 200 to 1500 grammes.                     Investigating
this in my own case I found that the average amount was 400
grammes.
    Method of Investigation. — Ten grammes of each of the various
foods as prepared for the table were accurately weighed out, placed
in a    large   tube, and heated      to 38" C.    Two cubic centimetres of
mixed human saliva          were then added.      A series    of these tubes were
prepared, and the whole was placed               on   a  water-bath kept at       a
uniform temperature of 38" C. At intervals                 a tube was removed,
and the condition of its contents noted.
    Porridge      forms a fairly easily digested         article of food.      The
greater     the   dilution   of the porridge, however, as with water or
milk,    the greater is its ease    of digestion   ;  in fact, well-made water
gruel is one of the most easily digested of foods.
    The reason why potatoes           are so frequently badly borne by the
 stomach is probably due to the manner in which they are pre
 pared.     If, after being boiled, they        are finely     powdered, so that
 the saliva can gain ready access to the starch granules, they are
 easily and rapidly digested.         On the other hand, when potatoes are
 sent to     the table whole,        the probability      is that   they will    be
 imperfectly masticated,       and swallowed in fragments of more or less
 large size.      In such    a case the saliva can only act on the outer
surfaces of the fragments,            and the result       is  a  very   imperfect
digestion.       Were    potatoes prepared properly,       I feel sure  that they
 might    be   prescribed as frequently as other farinaceous foods              for
invalids or dyspeptics.
    As regards the digestion of        bread, the experiments showed that

 210          Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                     [ses*.
it   was much leas acted upon by saliva when eaten alone than when
taken along with some indifferent              fluid,   as water.        The greater
moistening of the bread which results produces                 a marked rapidity
in the action of ptyalin.
     Newly-baked        bread is not so rapidly acted upon by saliva as
stale bread, but the ultimate degree of starch conversion is greater
in the former than in the latter.              So far as these          experiments
show, stale      bread     is not more easily digested          than newly-baked
 bread.
   . Bread in  a  light and spongy condition          (as is met with        in well-
aerated varieties, e.g.,      Vienna bread) is more rapidly acted upon by
saliva than when less spongy.            Such bread, however, does not ulti
mately undergo any more complete                digestion than does ordinary
bread.
     The  addition       of butter   to   bread   has    little or     no   effect   on
amylopsis by ptyalin.          Cheese,   on the contrary, has a stimulating
effect on the salivary secretion       ; and, apart from the consideration            of
its digestibility,    it  has a helpful action in promoting starch proteo
lysis.
     The addition of milk to bread causes          a  remarkable enfeeblement
of the salivary        ferment, while     broth    exerts    a   slight   restraining
influence on it.
     When   bread is chewed along with an infusion of tea, only about
one-half the amount of sugar is formed               as   compared      to the same
 proceeding     when bread       and water are alone           employed.        Coffee
 has no great effect in hindering         or slowing starch proteolysis, and
 the same is true of cocoa.
     Beer seems to exert a stimulating             action on ptyalin, as even
 from the earliest period the amount of sugar formed is in excess
 of that produced in the presence of water alone.
     Alcohol,  even      in dilute solution, retards salivary digestion of
 starch,  but the action is much less marked than in the case
 of infusions      of tea.     Whisky     permanently        lessens    the    activity
 of ptyalin.
     Wines have     a   very marked inhibitory influence on the digestion
 of starch by saliva, and this is almost wholly due to their acidity.
  Kven after three hours' digestion in the presence                  of sherry, port,
 or claret starch undergoes        hardly any conversion.

      The more dense, the less broken down, or the firmer the                  jelly in
 which the starchy food is when undergoing salivary digestion, the
less rapid and          extensive is the proteolysis.
      Amylaceous substances         are more easily acted on by saliva when
thoroughly moist than when more or less dry.

   On Torsional Oscillations                  of Wires.       By  Dr W.      Peddie.
                                      (Read June 20, 1898.)
                                          {Abstract.)
     This paper is in continuation of two others, on the same                    subject,
previously communicated to the Society.                    It  consists  of two    part?,
the first experimental, the second theoretical.
     The wire which was experimented upon was the one which                           was
used     in   the    previous experiments, and the              apparatus      was that
 described      in the latter of the communications above referred                 to.
     In    the   first paper      {Phil.    Mag.,   1894)   it was shown that          the
 equation
                                       if{x  + a) = b,
 where n, a, and b, are constants              in any   one experiment, represents
 to a very high degree of accuracy               the relation between y, the range
 of oscillation, and r, the number of oscillations.                     In   the second
 paper {Trail*.         11. S. E., 1896), the result of attempts to determine
 the nature of the dependence                of u upon (1) magnitude of initial
                         amount of " fatigue
                                                    "
 oscillation,      ('2)                                of the wire, were described.
  It  was found to be impossible, under the subsisting conditions                         as
  to fatigue, to separate the effects of fatigue, and             initial  range.
      The first scries of experiments described in the present                       paper
  was conducted under the condition of excessive fatigue of the wire.
  The effect of magnitude of initial range was found to be practically
 eliminated.          Thus it was possible to express all the results of               that
 series by a general          formula, of the above type, in which n and              b are
  absolutely constant, while a is given in terms of the initial                   range.
      In  the second paper above alluded to, it was shown that, through
  out the      series of experiments therein described, the                  product      id>
  might be regarded as constant.                 And it   was pointed out that this
  was, so far,       an accident depending           on the size of the        scale-unit.
  The importance of the result lay in the fact, that                        a scale-unit
  which made the product constant could be found                     ;  and that, if     the
   product were constant,           a  critical angle    of oscillation, at which       the

value of the loss of energy per oscillation is independent of n, must
exist.
   In    the first series described in the        present     paper, the (constant)
product of n and        6, has a value about one-half of the former, the
diminution being due to a great change in the value of                   b, caused    by
the excessive fatigue employed.              Excessive fatigue makes the value
of n tend to unity.
   A recalculation of the constants in              the formula; in Table          I. of
the first paper is made         by the method now used            ; and it is shown
that, while      nb is not constant, \og.uh is a linear function                of n —
the    two quantities       increasing simultaneously.            This implies       the
existence of a critical angle greater than that subsequently obtained,
so  that the critical angle is diminished by fatigue.
    It  is further    shown that      log.'<  may be regarded,        in each series
of experiments, as a linear             function    of n.      With    the    observed
values      of n, it is impossible to tell which             of log.//    or  log.nb   is
more accurately a linear            function    of n — though both cannot be
truly such        a  function     simultaneously.        The chief      experimental
result obtained is independent             of this question.        It  is found that
in every series of experiment*, if conditions under trhirh n had the
value unity are attainable, the value of b in abxolutrly rontstant.
This seems to indicate a quantity which is dependent only on the
nature of the substance          of which the wire is composed.
    A modification of the apparatus             was employed to compare              the
times of out and in motions during              the oscillations.        11  was found
 that the time of inward           motion exceeds        that of outward motion
 through the same range.
    It   is also shown that the            magnitude of the         total    period    of
 oscillation    has no observable effect on the values of the constants
 in the equation given at the commencement                  of this abstract.
    In    the first paper on this subject communicated to the Society,
 the equation       just alluded      to was    deduced      from the assumption
 that the defect of the          potential energy       from the value which it
 would have in accordance            with Hooke's Law           is proportional to a
 power of the angle of distortion.               In   the  theoretical part of the
 present paper the assumption is made that molecular groups on the
 average obey Hooke's          Law in their distortions, and that definite
 groups have a definite        limit of distortion beyond which             they break

down and instantaneously re-form.                 The loss of energy in oscilla
tions of the system is due to the rupture of such groups.
    If the assumption that the         breaking limit of distortion is evenly
distributed      among    groups   be made, the theory indicates that the
relation y (x + a) = b holds between range of oscillation and number
of oscillations. This is the relation which was found to hold under
great    fatigue.     Thus the effect of fatigue may be to produce this
even    distribution.      In this    case    Hooke's     Law    is not obeyed        —a
term involving       the square of the distortion          appearing     ; so   that, in
an outward oscillation, the         distortion is an elliptic function of the
time.     The theoretical law is shown to accord very closely with
the results of observation.
    In   the   second    half of    the    inward    motion, according           to the
theory, the inward acceleration is less than that at the same stage
in the outward motion by a constant amount.                       It   is always less
at any stage.        Thus we deduce         the experimentally found relation
between the times of out and in motions over                a  given range.
    Further,    if the wire, after its first positive distortion, be stopped
just   short     of the zero     and be again distorted             in   the   positive
direction, the theory shows that, while the same law connecting
distortion with distorting force holds, the co-efficient of the term
 which     involves    the  square    of the distortion       is greatly      reduced.
Thus Hooke's Law is much more nearly obeyed in the                               second
 distortion.      This is in     complete agreement           with Wiedemann's
observations (Phil.               Jan.    1880).     On the other hand,           if the
zero be passed, the wire is reduced to its original condition.
    If  the    assumption     that the number of groups which                    have a
definite      breaking    distortion    is   constant for       all distortions        be
replaced      by the assumption that it is proportional to a power of
the distortion, the term, in the expression for the distorting force,
which      represents    the   deviation      from   Hooke's       Law involves          a
power of the distortion           different     from the     second.        Thus      the
assumption, made in the first paper on the subject, that the defect
of the potential        energy,   from the value that it would have                     in
accordance       with Hooke's Law          is proportional     to a power of the
distortion, is deduced       as a consequence       of  a  certain, uneven, distri
bution      of number of groups in respect             to the     extreme      limit of
sustainable distortion.

    The general    relation between  torsion and  set  is also  dis
cussed.
    It is not to be supposed that good agreement of the results of
theory with the results of experiment necessarily constitutes a
proof of the particular theory. The aim in the paper is rather to
show how completely the general action of imperfectly elastic
materials  may be accounted for upon simple and   reasonable  views
regarding molecular statistics.

  The Strains produced in Iron, Steel, Nickel, and Cobalt-
       Tubes in the Magnetic Field. Part II. By Professor
       C G. Knott, D.Sc, F.R.S.E.

    The most       important    part of the paper         lias to do with the be
 haviour of certain iron and nickel tubes, considerably shorter and
 narrower than those discussed          in Part   I.*     Two iron       bars,  A and
 B (A being twice      the length of     B), and   a  nickel bar, B, were bored
 out by successive stages, so      as   to give    three     series of tubes     of in
 creasing    bore.   Each tube was subjected to four distinct experi
 ments.     These were —
    1. Measurements in various magnetic               fields of the correspond
 ing changes of volume of bore.
    2.  Measurements in the same fields of changes of length.
    3. Measurements in the same fields of changes of volume of the
material of the tube.
    4. Measurements in the same fields of apparent external changes
of volume, the tube being plugged and treated                  as a bar.
    Prom    these   measurements      the principal      coefficients    of strain at
the inner and outer walls were determined.                 An element originally
spherical became changed          into an    ellipsoid, whose principal axes
were parallel to the axis of the tube, parallel to the radius of                    the
tube passing through the element,           and perpendicular to these             two
directions.      The   corresponding      coefficients     of strain      are   distin

and the tangential elongation, fi.

tubes    of narrower bore.                         As the bore                 is        increased              and the thick

                                        (Read May 2, 1898.)
    The prime object of the following paper is to assist in decipher
ing    the    irregular        traces     which           represent       the       consonants in                  a
phonographic record, by investigating                               a priori, from the causes
which create the               consonant,           the      elements      which            probably           lie
entangled       in the tracing to              be interpreted.             Accurately speaking,
the difference between vowel and consonant is not one of nature,
but    of function.            To      define       either        vowel    or       consonant,           it        is
necessary first to define a syllable.                        All    human speech proceeds in
rapid alternations             of louder and softer,                  more      sonorous           and        less
sonorous.        These alternations                  vary considerably in energy                     ;        any
one    of them may be twice                    as   long, or twice             as    loud, or twice            as
sudden in its rise or             in its fall       as its    next neighbour.                They seem,
in fact, to tend both             in duration and in form and in                          energy rather
to a successive          change than to any regularity ; but each of them is
a   syllable.      A     syllable, then, is           a   wave of sonority, one climax of
sound,     with its accompanying                    rise and fall.         Accurately speaking,
this    climax          is a subjective one.                  It    usually         has     its objective
counterpart in           a   climax of amplitude, which again has its counter
part in a maximum of depth in the phonographic furrow                                          ;   but this
is not always the              case.     Noise does not produce the cumulative
subjective effects of tone ;              it      is therefore less loud than tone, when
proceeding        from        vibrations of equal amplitude.                              Every     speech-
sound is a mixture of noise                    and tone       ;    in vowels        the proportion of
noise is     very small, though never quite negligible                                ;    but in conso
nants    it     ranges       from a very small to                   a very          largo    proportion.
Hence        the irregularity           of        consonantal        phonograms reaches                        its
height       in those consonants which contain the largest amount of
noise, that       is,   of more or less irregular vibration.                           Still there            is   a
difference between noise                 and noise, though                it   is    less definite and
less assignable         than the difference between tone and tone.                                  Noises

differ in duration, in suddenness           of rise and fall, in the degree of
their irregularity of vibration, and in the average               period of those
vibrations.     This   average       period may also increase          or decrease
during the utterance of       a   given sound, and may do so more or less
rapidly.      These distinctions are all apprehensible by the ear, and
they are vital to the recognition of consonants.                The function of       a
vowel is to constitute the strong sound which forms the climax of
a  syllable.    The function of       a consonant is to connect those stronger
sounds together,     so as to       form waves of sonority, i.e., syllables.
Every syllable must have a vowel, but it need not have                      a conso
nant   ; a   vowel by itself is      a wave     of sonority, because it always
has a rise and a     fall of intensity, however brief and           feeble.
    Consonants serve, however, both to make the minima of sonority
more     marked, and at the same time                to  enable    us to    multiply
enormously the number of significant syllables at our command,
by changing the consonants.
    The essence of     a  consonant,       then, is simply to be less sonorous
 than the adjacent vowel        ;  and the essence of      a  vowel is to be more
 sonorous    than the adjacent consonants.              Some   speech-sounds        are
 so sonorous    as to be practically always used as vowels ; others are
 so wanting in sonority as to be practically always used as conso
 nants.     But  there are some of a middle kind, which                can be used
 either way.      When this      is to be done, their relative sonority           is in
practice heightened or reduced by an addition                    or subtraction of
 stress, i.e., of lung-pressure.        In   this way it is easy to pronounce
 aia or ana so    as to make      both   i  and u function distinctly      as   conso
 nants.     (I use the letters here and elsewhere           in their Latin values,
 except in spelling    English words.) But the « used in hissing, the
 sh used    in hushing, the I in bottle, the n in eaten (eat'n) each
 function distinctly as vowels, because they constitute, or have the
 power to constitute, each by itself,          a syllable.
    But   some syllables begin or end with more than one consonant.
 When syllables        are  built in this way, inherent differences of
 sonority again obtrude themselves.               The syllable is essentially a
 wave of sonority, one rise and one fall.                  Therefore    consonants
 cannot be built into it at random, but only in the order of                  a rising
 and falling sonority.      A syllable can no more begin with It or nt
 than it can end with tl or tn.            This is simply because I and n are

always more                    sonorous than t.           But in           the    contrary order there is
no difficulty              :    compare bolt with Lottie, wound                             with     wooden, and
the like.             But when               the inherent          difference of sonority is small,
the required rise or                       fall may    be created by addition                      or subtraction
of stress ; compare                    tcist and wits, rVar and star.
     The essential weakness of consonant sounds                                             is generally based
upon a relative obstruction of exit.                                 M. Mariehelle in                his excellent
little work,               La Parole            d'apres le Trace du Phonoij raphe (Paris,
1897), makes this the universal test of the difference between vowel
and consonant.                       But     there is practically no              h   in French, otherwise
M. Mariehelle would have seen that this criterion is faulty.                                                          The
exit of h is generally                       just    as wide as that of the following                            vowel
(r.   infra).              Phoneticians, however, use this fact of constricted exit
to   classify consonants in two different ways, first,                                         as to the         mode,
and secondly, as to the place                           or places of the constriction.                               They
then divide them                     a     third time, according to the manner in which
the larynx                 is    concerned in their respective                            production.           Under
the first head                 it   will   be simplest to regard at first only three chief
categories — fricative, plosive, and                               nasal.        A    fricative       sound such
as   c     or   It   is   distinguished by the frictional rush of breath through                                            a
more or less obstructed opening                           ;    a   plosive, such as p,                b,   t,   or    </,   is
marked by              a       sharp percussion, the result of the sudden creation or
sudden               removal of            a   complete       stoppage       ;   a    nasal        also    implies          a
complete              stoppage         in      the   mouth, but with free exit through the
nose.
     Under the second                        head,    the places            of constriction               normal to
English and                    Scotch        pronunciation           are     fully         enumerated           below.
Under the third head there are three well-marked                                                    categories              of
consonants — toned, whispered, and                                 spirate.           In   a   toned consonant
the larynx                is   vibrating — producing
                                                tone  in whispered consonant
                                                                         ;        a
it   is    in   a    hissing position — producing whisper in     spirate conso        ;        a
nant       it   is    wide open— giving nothing but      full supply of breath.
                                                                              a
Of the examples already given,                            s,  /,    h,   p, and       t    are spirate     ;    and         v,
z,    b,   and       d     are ambiguous, because                    they may be either toned or
whispered.                     But   the     toned and whispered classes are precisely of
equal           extent;         it    will     suffice, therefore, simply to remember                                that
every toned                symbol has always              a   whispered value, acoustically very
different             from the toned value, and highly important to this in

tongue and palate,         (4) a frictional constriction between lower teeth
and upper lip.          The words frictional and non-frictional are (and
will be) used to indicate that the issuing breath does or does not
produce      audible friction.         The above        conditions are exhaustive                 ;
and they are essential.           If   the  nose is open, the breath flows out
that way, either silently           or in a nasal aspirate          ;   if   the     larynx      is
open, but not breathing,             there  is silence     ;  if it   is breathing, but
not freely open, there is either tone or whisper, and the                          /   is trans
formed into a toned or whispered              v ;   if  the tongue       is moved up, so
as to   make the inner passage at all frictional, the                 /   is changed         into
6; and       if the outer constriction is relaxed till it                     ceases to be
markedly frictional, the         /melts away into            a  kind of       h.      It  ought
to be possible, starting            from these        completely determined con
ditions of     /, to discover something about the resulting sound.
      In/ there is but      one source of sound          ; it  is the frictional           noise
 of the breath straggling through the narrow interstices between the
 teeth and the lip.         But this    noise awakens resonance                in the cavity
 behind ; and though this resonance               has not the perfect regularity
 of a musical      tone   it is regular enough to convey                   a    less     definite
 sensation of its own frequency, i.e., of its pitch.                    In      this respect,
/ serves     as a  preliminary      type of all fricative         consonants.             Every
 fricative consonant contains frictional noise, and resonance                             conse
 quent upon it.         The simplicity of      /   is that     it  has friction in ono
 place only, resonance          apparently in one cavity only, and no im
 perative alteration        either in the friction or in the resonance,                       i.e.,
  neither of them need change            in character from beginning                 to end of
  the consonant.         These fricative resonances             have    some important
  features in common.           One and all, they are prompted by irregular
  noises,   in cavities of somewhat irregular                  shape.        Such        cavities
  never have an exact proper tone,                 like a pipe, or           a    string, or      a
  tuning-fork;      they respond to any stimulus which                       is sufficiently
   near to     their   proper tone.        Hence       the character            which      these
   resonances present to the ear.             They are weak              through mutual
   interference ; they are        indefinite,    so that       it is impossible to fix
   their position    in the   octave    by ear to an exact            semitone         ;  and to
   what octave       they belong it is always utterly impossible to say.
   Xevertheless,     when they are forced by any change                     of articulation
    to change   their pitch, the      change   in    the whole body of resonance

 uncertain           ;     that of / in fall is             about    /—   five semitones         lower.              But
 it is     best to study the consonant                          / apart from any vowel.
      It   is   a    further good reason                    for beginning with / and                  those frica
 tives which most resemble                            it,   that they can be produced in isola
 tion, and prolonged ad libitum without                                   at all losing their charac
 teristic effects on the ear.                           It    is a   long time before the phonetic
 observer acquires                   the     conscious        separate      command of each of his
 organs       — velum,              nares, larynx and tongue.                    After   the consciousness
 of their separate                   action comes the                 consciousness           of their several
 positions, at any given time.                              This     consciousness       grows in accuracy
 by actual inspection and handling, and by nothing else.                                                   But   it   is
 at first quite unreliable, and must be trusted no further than                                                 it   can
 be tested by the mirror, the probe or the finger, or by diagrams set
 out from the testimony of these.                                When    these cautions are observed,
 the following observations may be carried out concerning                                             /.
    When freed from connection with any vowel, the resonance of/
 can be carried   long way both up and down in pitch, without at
                                a
 all spoiling the itself. Its whole range in the individual speaker
                              /
 is   about two octaves                 — an     octave each way from the              /        in   fall.       Add
 to this range another octave for the                                 difference between infant and
 adult resonances, and                     it   becomes clear that               the essential            quality     of
/is      but vaguely linked with the actual pitch of its resonance.                                              The
 quest made in that direction                          is    therefore    a   vain one    :     we must look
 elsewhere            for the acoustic               essence of        /,   or of any other fricative.
 But     it     is   not vain to ask whence that resonance comes.                                          It   seems
 clearly to arise in that free passage between the tongue and palate
 which        is     an essential part of the articulation of                     /.      This       is   evidenced
 by tho fact that  in the upper octave of                                        its range       this passage
 lengthens or shortens itself in proportion                                 to the fall or rise of the
 pitch of the resonance.                         It    is    impossible to lengthen the passage
 any more than this                   ;    and the further fall             is   secured by bulging the
 passage,           till      at last   it   becomes         a     considerable cavity.               The upper
 octave, with   its simple lengthening and shortening of tube, affords
 some criterion of the real pitch of the resonance.  In my case, the
 tube at its longest    about 100 mm., at its shortest about 50 mm.

Its effective length will always be rather longer, because it has
some       width, and does not open at both ends abruptly into free air.
The highest            resonance           in my case is therefore doubtless,/*, 2816
v.d.; and the lowest,/2, 704 v.d.                                     The former is the pitch of                  a
narrow pipe 60 mm. long.
     The      whole sound of                /,    in isolation, appears                 to consist     of this
single resonance and the original friction at the teeth.                                          Three other
sounds in our table seem to enjoy an equal simplicity of composition.
Not    till     these       are being treated                   can we profitably ask wherein                     /
differs acoustically from every other consonant.
                                                               9.
     This is the th in thin.                     Its relationship            to   /   is shown by the fact,
already stated, that                 if,   during the articulation of an ordinary                         /,    the
point and blade of the tongue are moved slightly upwards, so as to
create an       aerial friction             between,            the tongue            and the upper teeth,
the   /is     then transformed into                       9.        The resonance        rises at the same
time about         a   semitone.            This       appears to be due only to the alight
fore-shortening of the tube, which now ends inside rather than
outside of the upper teeth.                           This slight           difference       persists in con
nection       with given             vowels,      e.g.,        my    6   in theme gives        V,   1080 v.d.     ;
in thaw       it     gives/3*         1491 v.d.                With      these compare         those of     /in
fee and       fall.      But when           6    is   tried in isolation           it   is   found to have       a
rather less range of possible resonance than                                 /.        The reason for this,
however,         is    not acoustic,             but physiological            :       the tongue tip       is   no
longer free        ;   it   must remain always in close proximity to the upper
teeth.        This stiffer position prevents                             the tongue          from    acting      so
freely as before            :   it   especially        prevents that sinking and withdrawal
of the        tongue-tip, by which                        the bulging         of the passage can                be
carried so far in           /.       Thus the range of the                   $    resonance     is   shortened
considerably           at the lower end.                       In my       case   it    reaches      only from
a-, 880 v.d. to f*, 2816 v.d.
     There      is    no evidence           that      6   contains more than two audible ele
ments, namely, this resonance                             and the original friction             :    and there
is   no essential difference                 in pitch between this resonance                          and that
of/.        Such differences               as do       exist seem due to physiological acci
dent only.             Where, then,          is   the acoustic difference between                     6   and   ft

length of the frictional         passage is at most       the thickness of the
teeth, about 3 mm.         But in    0 it is from    4 to 6 times this length        :
the resistance to the breath is much greater            : and these conditions
are essential   ; for if the application of      the tongue is relaxed in such
a  way that friction      only takes    place against the tip, and not also
against the blade of the tongue, the sound becomes much more                    like
/ than   0.   Whether this difference in the exciting noise leads also
to any marked difference in the resonance excited, it would be
premature to say. The ear testifies that in passing from to 0, the    /
slight rise in pitch is accompanied by          a great increase    in shrillness
of quality.      This  may be due only to the new friction.             But the
narrowing of the tube has made it more capable of producing an
overtone.      Some    trace  of the first overtone might reasonably be
looked for.
    Here the matter must rest until the phonographic traces of                      /
and   6 have    been sufficiently magnified and accurately compared.
The   successes of    Dr Boeke and M. Marichelle in obtaining magni
fied photographs of phonographic tracings justify great hopes of
successful   comparison.       But such     a comparison      will be very   diffi
cult to follow out, unless care is taken that the resonance is at the
same pitch in both examples.            This might be secured pretty nearly
by recording them in connection with an identical vowel.                        But
there are pitfalls in all pronunciations of connected sounds, which
will be noted by and by ; if they could be recorded at the same
pitch in isolation, it would be much better.               The frictional noises
will   doubtless    come out in the phonogram as distortions of                  the
resonance.       These ought to be much longer and deeper in              6   than
in   /;  and   if  there  is an    overtone,    it ought to show itself in a
tendency of the resonantal vibrations to flatten or notch themselves
in  the middle.

    These are the sounds of ch in the Scotch words licht and loch.
They are heard also in German words like ich and dock.                  They are
very much alike in sound,           and are best examined together            ;   for
they differ little in analysis, except in the actual pitch of resonance.
But German phoneticians             agree    in representing them by two
 different signs, and there is in practice         a  certain physiological gap
 between    them, which      will be explained later.        As in / and    6,    the

conditions of their production are four.                  Two of     these are the same
as   in those cases, namely closed nares, and                a  larynx fully open and
breathing      ;   and the     other two         are identical    in kind,       namely,      a
frictional constriction          and     a Tesonant     passage.       But    there  is this
broad distinction,         that the frictional        constriction is now situated,
not     at the outer, but at the              inner end of the resonant passage.
This     has an       important       influence on the acoustic result.                   Tin;
frictional       noises   of  /   and     6  work backwards upon the resonant
passage ; but they also              work forwards to the            listening ear, and
make their own direct, unmodified impression iipon it.                           In x   and  \
this is not so.         The frictional noises can only reach the ear through
the resonant passage,            and the result is that they are all more or
less damped,         except those to which the resonance                   of the passage
just happens to respond            ;  and these merge themselves               into the rest
of    the   resonance.        The      longer     the   passage     the greater       is   the
damping       of the noises, and the nearer does the resonance approach
to the regularity          of musical tone.           Hence the resonance           of    \  is
notably less rough in quality, and more definite in pitch, than that
of x.      But this     does not appear to arise from any considerable                     dif
ference in the original noise.               The    \ constriction     is formed against
the soft palate, and the x constriction against the hard palate                         ;  but
the degree of obstruction               and the length of the frictional passage
seem to be        fairly constant, and          to resemble    those of 6 rather than
 those of   /.      The dorsum       of the tongue        is incapable of framing             a
 short frictional       orifice against        tho   palate, like     that framed by         /
 against the teeth.          When       tho resonances are listened to          in isolation
 there is found to be no necessary gap between                   x and x : they extend
 in   me  without     a break from       f%     2982 v.n. down to cl 528 v.D. ; but
  this lower     limit  can only be reached by vigorous rounding and pro
 trusion of the lips.           The resonant passage is found at the same
  time to undergo a progressive             change of shape, very similar to that
  described for      / and  6

  longer found behind, but before.                 For this  reason     it  is much easier
  of inspection,      and its changes can be noted             by the most unassisted
 observer.        Its range of transformation is greater than that of                   8, be
 cause    the tongue-tip is again           free, and the bulging of the passage
 can be    carried out to its fullest extent.             Measurements in the upper
  octave   of resonance         are much         the  same as      before.       When      the

obvious       :    the 6 passage sharply converges ; the                              \    passage sharply
diverges,          and the      /   passage does neither.                      After the    changes of this
upper octave have been noted in the x and x passage by the eye,
those of the 6 passage are readily imagined, for the same octave, by
conceiving          a reversal       of the passage, end for end.                          The cause which
creates in practice a certain gap between x and x is the organic
facility of creating a frictional passage, either (1) just behind the
alveolars, or (2) between the post-dorsum and the velum. The so-
called     " front " vowels,
                          such as i and e, connect themselves most
easily with the former ; but the

latter.           Thus it is the vowel in Held and loch which determines                                         the
consonant,       making the one x and the other x-
     A    question here suggests itself to the investigator, which must
be considered             before         going further.                 The resonances           of   / and        6
came from behind the constriction.                                      How      do we know            that no
resonance           comes from behind            of x and x 1 To

this question it is impossible to answer quite positively. The ear
does not            recognise        any such secondary element.                              But      a weak
secondary           element         might conceivably be there, and be essential to
the x and x, though not separately                                 audible.      In whispered fricatives
there is such a secondary                          element, which at first escapes separate
recognition, but may easily be felt by comparing                                       / with whispered
v,   or   0   with whispered                   cf,      or any similar pair.           The secondary re
sonance           in x or      x>
                                    if   it   exists, must be weaker still, for                       it   eludes
the ear under all circumstances.

essential         that   a     resonant        tube shall have been framed                   ;   inside that
of x or       x     the formation                  of such         a   tube    seems to      be sedulously
avoided.            The observer,                  feeling inside the x constriction,                      is    sur

tion is maintained by a strong pull of the muscles                                                       running from
the inner surface of the lower                           jaw        to the tongue-bone                        and root of
the     tongue.     The growing contraction of                                   those         muscles              is to be
easily felt outside, when the resonance                                      of x is raised               step by step
to its highest.             It   seems to be of the essence, therefore, of                                            and x,
that their constrictions                        shall open as abruptly as may be into the
pharyngeal         cavity        ;    and thus the formation of                           a   resonant tube in
side the       constriction,               resembling that of                   /    or       0,     is avoided, ap
parently        with intention                  and effort.             Something of the same kind
happens with        / and             6.         Their resonant                passages cannot open                             so
abruptly        into the pharynx                   as that of x, because                           that is not their
constricted end         :    but the same sharp declivity may bo felt at the
inner end of either passage                         ;    and the same co-operation                                    of    the
muscles       under the jaw may be felt externally, when the pitch of
either resonance             is carried towards its upward                                    limit.           If     any of
these    consonants,             /,   6,    r,    x, does          possess       an inner, weaker reso
nance,       it is certainly of low pitch                     ;    for the larynx is wide open, the
body of air to be agitated                       extends right down to the lungs, and its
aperture is relatively small.                           It    remains to bo seen whether any
such elements        can be detected in phonograms.                                       As       for the principal
resonance of x and x,                      it   does not differ essentially from that of                                        /
or   8; the difference must again be sought, not in the resonance it
self,   but in the nature of its distortions.                                   These will probably bo
less random        and less violent than those of either                                       /     or 6, especially
in x.

breath.         These two conditions hang necessarily                                         together          ;    for the

These are (1) the friction, and (2) the resonance.    It is the dis
tinguishing feature of the h friction that it does not take place at
any definite point                     :   in fact it is convenient to regard as the                                      purest
or most typical h that                          kind of       aspirate which creates friction                              at all
points of the voice-passage, from the pharynx                                                  to the external air.
This implies that in                        such        an   h    the degree of obstruction                           is fairly
uniform            ;    and this in turn implies that the resonant                                         passage            is of
fairly uniform calibre throughout.                                          This position of                    the organs
does not materially differ from that which they naturally                                                                 assume
in sighing              ;   and thus the pitch of a sigh differs little from that of
this typical h.                    In      me it seems to be about                       e3   1320 v.d.
     Leaving h for a moment,                                 it may         be remarked that not only                               h,
but every fricative, tends to what may be called                                                     a     neutral         type,
when pronounced in isolation.                                      Underlying all our                      articulations,
there is the principle of economy                                       of adjustment.                   "When we start
from       a state           of rest and end in                   a state       of rest, the articulation                        de
parts usually from the position of rest, the ordinary silent                                                          position,
so far as is necessary,                         and no further.                 Hence          /,   0,    and    x>
                                                                                                                       no       less
than h, have what may be called a neutral pitch                                                            in        every in
dividual.                   In myself           I   find that this neutral pitch                         is,   for   /,    about

steady rise from                   h       to   0    corresponds            well with the changes                          in   the
oral passage.                    In   Ii    the passage embraces the whole distance from
the pharynx                                 external air, and                            wide all through

it   is    slightly foreshortened, and much narrowed at one end                                                           :      \
it   recovers           a    little length forward, but loses considerably in                                             length
behind                 and in      6       foreshortening               again        occurs         in stronger               form

no longer quite neutral h to the            ear, when      it   is drawn much away
from this unbiassed         articulation.       And the       reason       is clear.      This
far from that arrangement             in any direction, without making                      the
passage    distinctly narrower in some places than in others                        ;   and if
narrower, then more obstructive and more                     frictional.         "Whenever
the   friction of    h is thus localised,      it at   once      departs        moro or less
from the simple neutral            sound of h.          Yet this        is the kind of h
which usually occurs          in actual     speech.       "Whether           the departure
from type can be recognised by the hearer or not, depends                              on the
extent of the departure,           and the acuteness            of    the listening        ear.
One    kind of departure is patent to everybody                  :  it is when the con
striction is so local and so tight as to transform the h into a x or                          \.
Precise and forcible speakers          may often be heard to pronounce he
who as art
                x&.     But A.     J.   Ellis, the translator               of Ilelmholtz,
noticed     many years ago that a mere ordinary                     7/ often carries        the
impress    of the   following vowel.         In other words, if             the pronuncia
tion of a    word beginning with            h is arrested before the vowel is
actually begun, the ear can often recognise,                from the          h alone,    what
vowel was going to follow.
    This phenomenon is only one instance of                   a   habit of language           so
wide-spread      that it may be called            a  law.      It   is simply that tho
organs     are always      endeavouring        during     the      articulation       of any
phone, so     far as the conditions of that articulation                      will allow,     to
put    themselves      into   the   readiest position          for     commencing the
articulation     of the next phone.            Conceive in your mind tho in
tention of pronouncing the           word Hue       :  you will find your tonguo
in the   I position before you       have     even    begun to sound the               h.    In
the phenomenon          called umlaut,      so   important to all the Germanic
languages,     this influence extends even further back                  ;   for it modifies
the preceding      vowel.      The reason       why our h conveys,                as   a rule,
 not only the     sound of h, but an inference of tho following vowel,
 is simply     that the organs       have     already, during           the h, assumed
 something like the prospective vowel-position                 ;   so much so, indeed,
 that the oral or     forward    resonance      of the vowel is produced and
 heard,   with the distinctive breathy timbre of the h.                       Thus    a  quick
  ear infers the   vowel, though it does not really hear it                    ; for the ap

propriate hinder (pharyngeal) resonance                             of the vowel is wanting,
being impossible           with       an open larynx.              Even the h which is here
called neutral carries                with it the      same inference in actual speech,
for it arises before

this Society, vol. xxii. p. 99).
   Whether there is any hinder resonance                                in h is another question.
The only thing certain is that,                  if   present,      it is not       the same as the
hinder resonance               of the following              vowel.       The openness                  of the
constriction favours the exit of such                        a resonance        :   but the ear does
not testify to the presence                     of any second resonance,                 though on
whispering hi, ha, ho, etc., it does recognise easily that, in passing
from h to the vowel,      new (hinder) resonance has been added.
                                       a
Wo arrive therefore at the same conclusion for h as for /, 6, x, and x,
that, if it has      a second resonance,               it    is deep and very feeble.
  It    follows       from what has just been said that, in connected
speech, the resonance                 of h will be simply the oral resonance of the
following vowel.                   Certain qualifications of this statement must be
made    later    ;   it   is absolutely          true only of that part of                        h     which
immediately adjoins the vowel.                        But this shows that             the resonance
of h has at any rate the same range                           as   that of the oral resonance
in vowels, which               I   have tabulated from phonographic data                          {Journal
of Anat.       and Phijs., vol. xxxi.                   p.    251)       as   extending, in adult
male organs from /4 2816 v.d. down to                              d1   287 v.d.       This result is
roughly corroborated by the observation that every fricative yet
studied can be turned into an h by sufficiently relaxing its constric
tion, and reinforcing the breath.                       This observation is             best carried
out with x and            \,       because    their range is the widest                   29S2 v.d.
down to    c2    528 v.d.).                When their articulations                 are relaxed into
the h position a               fall of     resonance        can always be heard               ;       because
the passage is always widened and lengthened.                                   But the fall is un
equal, because the widening and lengthening are unequal                                   ;       they are
greater in x than in x.                    Hence the lower limit of the h resonance
drops further below that of the x resonance                                   than its higher limit
drops below that of the x resonance.
                                                                                                  7/,
   Still, in    the greater part of its range, the resonance                             of             covers
again the same ground which we have                                seen to be covered by                 /,   6,
x and  \  :    and again the characteristic of the consonant                                      is    found,
not in     the       pitch          of the     resonance,          but in the         nature of its

    modifications          and        distortions.               Wherein,        then, do          those     differ      ?
    The ear affirms at once that there                              is a total loss of those                    high,
shrill, hissing vibrations which are produced by the forced passage
 of air through             narrow apertures.                      When       we are able              to compare
sufficiently           magnified           phonograms of x or                    \   and h       (if   possible,    at
identical          pitches       of resonance),                  we shall probably                find the         dis
tortions        of   h     to be relatively                long     and gentle.              Overtones, also,
are    apparently not to be expected.                               The fact that the friction does
not originate            in one place, but traverses                        greater and less portions
of    the                                          have some characteristic effect on the

phonogram,             but of what              kind    it     would be rash to prophesy.                        The
phonogram              of this weak sound                  h will probably be very difficult to
obtain       in    a    very clear form.                   It will be easier to recognise that
frictional disturbance                     is   weaker in the resonance                     of   h     than in the
other fricatives                here studied than to find out the nature of the
disturbance            itself.
                                                       *   and    f.
     These are the              sounds of         s   in   see    or so, and of sh in site or show.
It   is   convenient,                at    this stage, to treat               them         together,        because
they have          a    curious parallelism, resembling that which has been
seen to      exist in   /        and       6.    But they           are     just     as distinct        from each
other     as/      and     6,    and far more distinct than x and                                 \,    which are
really complementary                       rather than parallel, and together constitute
only      one      series       of similar            sounds.          In    the     table       of consonants
already given,             it   is    seen at      a    glance      that the articulation, both of
*   and/,       is   somewhat more                     complex than that of                    /,      9,   s or    x-
Each      of       them      has          two constrictions            ;    it     has     not only         a   close
approach        of     a   certain part of the tongue                        to      a   certain part of the
hard palate and gums,                      but   it   has also an approach                of the lower to the
upper teeth.               When this             second constriction               is    not properly carried
out, both       s    and/        become           much feebler, and lose nearly all their
distinctive timbre.                       The organic effect of these two constrictions
is to create            between             them in both consonants                        a     fore-cavity        of
small       size     and        extremely             irregular        shape.            The      shape      of its
aperture        is   more irregular still, being                     framed between tho opposed
edges     of    the teeth.                The    office of this cavity does not appear                          until
the rest of the            articulation           is   explored.

     But even when the inner constriction, and what lies behind                                                             it,

observation at first.                  It    is      easy to discover that                    in both of            these
consonants          (as      in
                             /         and        0,      but not        as    in x and             x)      there      is   a
resonant passage                  behind the constriction.                           This        passage          is     less
accessible         to observation than any such                           passage that has been yet
examined.              But   it   is       evidently subject to exactly the same kind
of modifications which have been seen in all the other                                                   cases.        The
resonance          can be made              to move,           by modifications of the                         passage,
through two octaves of pitch.                                And that          the modifications are                        of
the    same,   kind       as before,         is      evidenced externally, at the upper                                  end
of   the scale by the same tension in the muscles                                             beneath the jaw,
and at the lower end of the scale by the same vigorous rounding
and protrusion of the                       lips.         Internally          also the lengthening and
shortening of passage which creates the upper octave of resonance
can be directly               observed           ;     and     though          the      bulging           of   passage
which creates the lower octavo                            is   less accessible            to direct observa
tion, the same muscular feelings are                                      experienced               as       in former
cases.        Therefore when the resonance                               is    found to extend through
two octaves, from                 g   to    g,   we conclude as before that the real range
is   from    ;/'   31G8 v.d. down to                   g"    792 v.d.          We expect                 a   slight rise
above        previous resonances,                     because       the        passage           has      again been
foreshortened by                  a    few millimetres,                  through the retreat                        of    its
orifice from the teeth to the alveolar ridge, and the result stated                                                         is
cousistent with that expectation.
     Up      to this point             there         is     nothing       to indicate any difference
between        s    and   f.          There are accidental differences                                 to     be noted
presently      ;    but just as in          /        and      6,   so here        no essential difference
is   to be found between                    those      two consonants,                  except in the nature
of the frictional exit from the resonant                                 passage.             In ythis         orifice      is
framed on          a   much larger scale than in                          s.       It    is   not only wider,
but it_extends much further back.                                   The       s   orifice     is    as   short      a    one
as the tongue can possibly frame.                                   It   is    also framed against the
ridge of the alveolars                ;     so    that the inner passage widens immedi
ately into non-frictional                        dimensions.              But      if     this      s    is    changed
into   f,    the tongue at once arches                         itself upwards,              so    that the          whole
fore-tongue         is   brought close to the upper slope of the alveolars,                                              and
thus     a   frictional       channel far longer than that of                                   s — longer             even

are naturally    deeper and stronger than those of *.                    It  is doubtless
in compensation for the greater               resistance       of so long a channel
that it is at the same time made less narrow than that of
   During   these observations          the office of the fort- cavity begins to
reveal itself.    It   appears     to act chiefly as a resonator.                This    fa<".
does   not come to light in ordinary circumstances.                       In    fact   mo*!
investigators have        thought that the chief phenomenon                       involved
was the impact of the out-going air upon the teeth                         ;  for within
ordinary limits there is no sign that this resonator                     is adjusted in
any way to reinforce the              sounds     poured into it from the inner
passage.    But that      is apparently        because a cavity so irre_r*ilar              in
shape, and     of such       irregular     orifice, has a certain considerable
range of resonance,        within which it will continue to respond fair'.y
well,   without readjustment.             But when either            *  or   / i-    carried
through the whole range of its resonance, there is                     a  very palpible
instinctive readjustment of this fore-cavity, and especially of its
orifice.   When      the resonance,        either of       s  or /,  is carried to the
highest point, there is an evident effort to increase and disencumber
the orifice,   by widening and spreading the lips. But when, on
the   other hand, it is carried to the lowest point, there is stror.c
effort to diminish       the    orifice   and     to    increase    its resistance,        by
pursing and protruding            the lips.      The aim of these adju-tEv-r.te
seems    manifestly to be a kind of tuning, whereby the proper pitch
of the cavity     is roughly       adjusted, so        as   to reinforce the so:nd-
which it is receiving from the inner passage.
   It may    be   remarked in           passing     that the       Gerrnm           (<W<)    is
frequently articulated with rounding and protrusion of lips.                            It i-
therefore   probable that it has            often    a   lower resonance         than the
normal    English f,    about    to be described.            The neutral      /    and    the
 neutral * have greater importance than any of the sounds hitherto
called   neutral;   because neither       «  nor  /  allows itself to      be so     readily
 drawn away from its neutral articulation (and for the individual,
 neutral resonance)        as any consonant             yet treated.         Already, in
carrying either     s ox   f   through the whole range of its resonance,
 the articulations at both ends of the scale, but especially at the
 lower end, have      been found more           laborious      ; whilst the resulting
 sounds have    been     less powerful.          Why should          these    two con.-o

Hants tend more          strongly to      a  fixed type of articulation             than any
previously described         1
   It is simply that there are now two resonances                           instead of     one,
and that these two resonances                  have     to be adjusted so as to rein
force each other.          It  is no longer permissible to arrange                  the avail
able  air-space      into any shape which will produce a resonance                          ; i;
must    be   arranged        into     two    portions whose           resonances     shall    be
nearly identical.          This     is a problem which,              were     it not for    the
above-named       devices of spreading and pursing the lips, and for                        the
considerable     range which the resonance                of the fore-cavity        possesses,
could only    be satisfied       by one specific         typo of articulation.           Such
an articulation would be as fixed as that of a vowel, and for the
same reason — that the resonances                 are not severally free, but must
be more or less        accurately adjusted to each other.                    In   English, in
fact, this seems to        be  almost the case with            8  and   / ;  for all English
speakers    have a strong aversion to employ either rounding or pro
trusion of lips in ordinary speech                ;  and, though the range              of the
resonance     of    the    fore-cavity is considerable, there is always                        a
natural preference          for the middle of that range, because it                     gives
the strongest      resonance        and the most forcible consonant.                    Hence
the resonances         both of      a  and   f   appear      to be far less mobile, in
English at least, than the resonances previously studied.                            They are
drawn aside like the others, no doubt, by adjacent phones, but                             how
far and how quickly can only be ascertained                         from    a  study of con
nected phonograms.
   When it     is endeavoured to determine for                      s  and    f  respectively
this neutral type,       a  curious difference          reveals itself — the accidental
difference already referred to            ;  the neutral pitch of /"is some             4 or 5
semitones    lower than that of           s.    This is     heard at once when           % and
/are    articulated in immediate succession,                     in either order;        and a
careful comparison of the articulations                    discloses     the reason.       It  i^
evident that the upward arching of the fore-tongue, wliich                                takes
place in passing from           s  to  f (see   ante)     disposes      the organs      to   the
formation of      a   longer palatal passage          ;   whilst in      s the necessity of
 avoiding friction        in    that    passage     causes the tongue             to hold ofl
 somewhat from the palate, and disposes                      it   to trend more rapidly
downwards into           the      open    pharynx.         Thus it happens           that the
 most convenient        f   passage is about £ longer than the most con

venient * passage,                  and    its pitch about              4    semitones         deeper.          An
additional convenience                    is that the same movement                          tunes the fore-
cavity also         ;    for it draws the tongue-tip                  2 or        3 mm.       backwards, it
enlarges the space under the tongue, and thus creatos the required
fall of pitch in the fore-cavity without                            any other movement what
ever.
     My neutral s has a pitch of                      e4b      2500         v.d. to     e*   2640 v.d., and
my        neutral/         one of         bh 1980 to          r4 2112         v.d.       The remarkable
thing about s is that its neutral pitch                          is nowhere near the middle
of its possible range.                    The other consonants,                   it   is true, have        their
neutral pitch somewhat above                         the middle of their range, but the
neutral       pitch        of      s is    within    3    or    4       semitones            of its    highest
extreme.            The old tinfoil           phonograph              failed more conspicuously
to reproduce             the keen sounds             of   i    and      «    than      any other phones.
It    is,   therefore,          quite according to expectation when we find                                  «   to
possess      ordinarily            the    highest resonance                 of all       consonants,            and
!    of   all vowels, and when we also find that their height                                              is   not
dissimilar       (i     has one resonance about                f*    2810 v.i>., see table in fra).
     But    it   must be always remembered                      that this high pitch                  is   not of
the essence             of the sensation called           .«
                                                          :     it   is     merely an accident, and
not even      a      universal           or necessary accident, of human physiology.

                    and/        but every consonant yet treated, can be produced

does their          difference from the rest, and from each other, reside                                         1
It   is   easiest       to answer this question                by remembering that                    *    differs
from/, and       f        differs from       $,   chiefly in the possession of                   a    resonant
fore-cavity.             It   is   the reinforcement derived from this cavity which
gives to      both of them                their great superiority in sonority over all
other       spirate        fricatives.       Tins     fact      has         its    counterpart         in       the
relative         depth        and distinctness of their                      phonograms.              But the

the ear through           the resonant cavity, which must modify                them
immensely.         An influence of this kind has           been   already noted in
the case of x and x : but the influence of the fore-cavity of s and                  f
is probably much stronger than that of the divergent tube of x and
X-      The effect of that influence will be to damp all the frictional
noises which are either graver or more              acute than the range       of  the
resonance       of the cavity     ;  whilst all   noises  within that range will
be more or less exaggerated.
     In  the phonogram of        /,  therefore, we ought perhaps to find the
 resonance      subject to      very   strong distortions, but none of them
 either much longer or much shorter than the waves of the reso
 nance     itself.    The same remark does not quite apply to s; the
 original frictional noises are so much acuter and weaker as not to
 afford the groundwork            for similar results.       The frictional     noises
 are perhaps renewed at the teeth.               In any     case the ear seems       to
 testify that they survive in an acuter form than those of               /      Here,
 as elsewhere,       the appearance      of good phonograms must be awaited.
                           Effects of Combination     :  Glide*.
      It is necessary      to say something here about the effects of com
  bination with other phones            upon the acoustic      composition of the
  class of consonants        just treated.    For though the spirate fricatives,
  and, indeed,       all fricative consonants,     can be produced and studied
  in an isolated form, they are never found isolated in actual speech.

  The very name             consonant     indicates that in ordinary language
  they are never sounded           alone.    There are some consonants          which
  it  is difficult, or even impossible, to sound alone.            Such sounds are
  essentially connective and transitional.              Unlike  the fricatives,   they
  never     consist,   and never can consist,       of a succession      of similar
  sounds     : it is of their       essence to change      continuously   ; in other
   words, they are not continuant, but gliding.                But there are con
  ditions of combination in actual speech, as will perhaps have been
  already gathered, which cause the fricatives themselves                    to  glide
   through very considerable changes, even in the duration of a single
  utterance of any one of them.              We cannot consider their possible
  combinations at this point exhaustively,               because   all other conso
   nants remain yet to be explored             ; but we can consider their com

binations        with vowels, which                  are not only             in themselves                 the most
important combinations, but which also serve, for the reason above
indicated,          to facilitate         a   subsequent study of those consonants
which are always and essentially of a gliding nature.
     Limited as our problem here                      is,   three classes of cases at once oiler
themselves          for solution:          (1)    that of        a      spirate fricative beginning
from silence          and ending in   (2) that of such
                                                 a   vowel,
                                                         fricative                                      a
leading from  vowel to silence, (3) that of
                      a                       joining two vowels.             it
The last case varies greatly.   If the two vowels connected aro
identical, this case            is   simpler than the other two                        :   if   not,    it   is   mom
complex.            Let    us start from the simplest case, remembering always
that the principle             which rules the process of articulation                                 is   economy
of adjustment — so long as that adjustment                                        suffices       to attain the*
sound desired.
     Before attacking            this problem         it    is   necessary             to lay aside           certain
prepossessions,           derived from orthography, which, from an acoustic
point of view, are more or less misleading.                                    AVc are apt to                   think
that the combinations                  asa or two contain but three                               sounds          each,
a-n-a and o-*-o       ;    and the ear seems to confirm this impression.                                             But
a    little consideration             shows that there                  aro really              five    sounds          in
each case       :   there are not only two vowels and an intervening con
sonant, but also two brief, yet inevitable, gliding                                        sounds,           the one
connecting the first vowel to the consonant, and the other connect
ing the consonant to the second vowel.                                  When           the pace of articu
lation     is   sufficiently relaxed, the existence                       of these glides becomes
quite     evident to the ear          ;    and the reason of their existence                                becomes
evident too.             The posture of the organs in the a or                              o     articulations
is   very different from their posture                       in    s.        In    passing         from       a    or   o
to   «,   two principal         movements            have to be carried                    out—        a   complete
opening         of the larynx,        and     a   raising of the tongue-tip some                                12      or
20        mm.       These       movements            are,     of        course,         attempted simul
taneously.          It    is   the duration of the longer one, therefore, which
determines the duration                    of the glide.                In    this case the tongue-
adjustment probably takes the longer time of the two.                                                      There        is
generally an instinctive                  effort to make glides                   as    short      as       possible.
They are by-products, necessary                       evils, which the speaker produces,
one may say,          against his will, and stifles                     as    far      as he      is    able.        As

Consider that the whole duration of the                                           s    may be only               ^   sec, and

half     as   long       as the consonant.                       How        is   it,   then, that the glide                is   not
separately             heard?              This         arises         chiefly         from       the    persistence              of
auditory          sensations.                   The         sensation            of the vowel does not                       sub
jectively        cease          at the point where the vowel                                     vibrations terminate
in the        phonogram.                   It         persists      during the whole duration                             of    the
glide, and practically blots                             it   out      by its more powerful timbre.                              It
follows, however, from the principle that the duration of the                                                               glide
is   the duration of the                        longest movement involved, that glides                                           are
not normally of at all equal length.                                         The combination                     hi in      blue,
already instanced,                    is   practically glideless, because the                              I     articulation
ran be, and               is,   framed inside the                     h   articulation, and simultaneously
with       it.       In combinations of                          //    +    vowel, there                is   a   real      glide,
because          the      larynx must                    have       time to shut before                      the     h    can    be
transformed into                    a     toned vowel            ;     and there            is   inevitably          a    certain
portion of this time during which the                                             h     has been spoiled by the
narrowing of the glottis, though the chords are not yet vibrating,
and the toned vowel                         is,       therefore, not yet begun.                          But this         period
must be exceedingly short                               ;   and in speaking of such combinations
in   a    former passage we have neglected                                             it   (see    also     infra).            But
sometimes            the transitional movement                               is    much more cumbrous than
these,        and takes               much longer time.                          At     times,      indeed,          it   is     im
possible,         by any attainable rapidity,                                    to prevent the                  glide being
audible to           a    quick ear.                   Take the English word,                        eel.        During          the
ee   the tongue             is   presontod              convex to the hard palate, with                              a   passage
of some 50 sq. mm. section                                     between them.                       For   I   this must            be
entirely          changed.                 The          tongue-tip           must           be     withdrawn              to the
alveolars        ;   the passage must be shut up, and new passages                                                        opened
at each          side     ;     the       convex curvature of the tongue-blade must                                               be
exchanged for one slightly                                    concave.            Hence the sound of                       the     ee
and the sound of the                       /    are never contiguous, and the                                dull    interven

quire so great a change of curvature.
   But something depends here on the speaker.                          Some    speakers
exert themselves much more to minimise their glides than others.
Southern English           pronunciation       is conspicuously        less alert than
Northern English in this respect             ;   and French is more alert than
either.     It    is through     this fondness for gliding            articulations   in
Southern       English that nearly all its vowels have developed                        a
" tail " of                  sound which        almost   makes      them into diph-
               obscureT
   Besides     these    preliminary       remarks on     glides in general,        it  is
necessary also to make some general remarks                      about      vowels.     I
have elsewhere (Phomtisclie             Studien, 1890-2) examined the articu
lations of all the cardinal vowels in detail, and have shown that
they appear        to be in every      case designed    to produce at least         two
resonances,      the   one proceeding from the oral, and the other from
the pharyngeal, part of the articulation.              For our      present    problem
it suffices to know very little about              the latter, but the details of
the former are important.              The following list of oral (adult male)
resonances is mainly          compiled from my table of such resonances,
all calculated from phonographic               data of sung vowels, in          Journal
of Anat. and Phyx.,            vol. xxxi. p. 251.         But these agreed          well
with those which         I   had previously derived (lor.           rit.) from direct
observation.         I have,  therefore, added, from direct observation, two
resonances of English          vowels (marked *) which arc wanting in the
other list.

sible to the oral resonance                        of the vowels covers largely the                                 same
ground       as the       range      possible to the               several        resonances          of      each       of
the     spirate fricatives               themselves.             And       the     reason       is not far               to
seek.
      In Phonetische Studien, vol. iii.                               p.   264,    I   showed                that     the
mechanism which                     produces           the    declining scale of resonance                            ex
hibited in this table is precisely that which has been seen to vary
the resonance           of each of these spirate fricative consonants.                                               The
oral articulation of close                    i    is a pipe-like          passage        along the            palate,
about 50 mm. long.                    This         passage increases              up to open            e,    when it
is about         100 mm. long.                The further fall of resonance is produced
step by step, by bulging the passage, and contracting                                              gradually             its
two apertures — the labial, by which it opens into the outer air,                                                     and
the     velar, by which                  it communicates with                       the      pharynx.                The
diagrams in Journal                      of Anaf,             and Phys.,          vol. xxxi., show                    the
same thing.
      The passage in which                        these       modifications are made                         is almost
identically         the    same passage                 in which,          by similar          modifications,
the resonance             of each spirate fricative has been conducted through
a series         of similar         changes            (see    ante).      Jliere      is,   therefore,             as   a
ride,      for   every spirate fricative,                    a possible articulation               approximat
ing more or             less    closely,          in resonance, form, and position,                              to   the
oral articulation              of   any rotrel which may happen to                             be adjacent                to
it.
      Recurring now to combinations of the type found to be simplest
(asa, olio,        ifi, etc.),      it   is       evident, from the principle                      of        economy,
that the articulation of                 a    consonant          so     situated will depart                   as little
as possible        from that of the vowel by which                                it   is    flanked on             both
sides.       I!ut when         it   is   asked how much this least                          possible          amounts
to, the answer varies somewhat with the vowel, and                                            still     more with
the consonant.                 There     is       one region of the articulation,                            however,
where        the same things happen always                                 in combinations                     of     this
class; this        is   the    pharyngeal region.                       Four things always                     happen
there, the closing of the larynx to form the first vowel, the opening
of    it   to form the         consonant,            the      closing of     it    again for the second
vowel, and the opening of                         it   at the finish.             It   is    the    second and
third of these four which concern us here, because they help                                                             to
create       the   on-glide and the ofT-glide, respectively, of the fricative

consonant.              But   there is        in   most cases another element                        in both of
these   glides, resulting from the changes taking place simultaneously
in    the oral       part of the articulation                      ;    and where             this stronger
element is        present, it will perhaps be                      hopeless            to look for any        dis
tinguishable traces of the brief and feeble glides developed in the
pharynx.
     But in the combinations of                     /(,   ihi, >Jf, a/ni,         <//«»,   ulu,    these glides
may possibly            be decipherable, because                       they are the only necessary
glides involved.              The oral articulation of                   h       need not change in the
least from that of the vowel by which                                    it      is    flanked.      The only
necessary change              is   the opening and shutting of the larynx.                                    Tin-
opening of the            larynx puts          an end to two things, — the tonic vibra
tions of the chords, and the                        resonance           of the pharyngeal cavity.
But the latter,           at least, will not perish quite instantaneously                                     ;   it
has   a     period       of    280       to    800 v.d., and doubtless has                             time       to
undergo     a    rapid fall of force and change of period, even during the
swift opening           of the chords.
     Next in simplicity              is   the      case of  /      and its compounds, in, etc,
a/a, ofo, ufu.            One effect of the remoteness                            and disconnection of
the hps      from the other vocal organs                           is    that the articulation of             /
and all other labials               interferes relatively little with that of other
kinds of sound            with which they                  are associated.                 The only move
ment which              takes place in the cases here to be considered                                     is     a
slight raising of the lower                   jaw and lower lip,                   enough      to bring       the
latter into contact with                  the tips of the upper teeth.                            This raising
is   greatest for        a/a and ofo, because the jaw   lowest in a and           is                          o   ;
and   it   is   least   for i/i and ufu. The reduction of the labial orifice
will tend in every case to produce some drop in the oral reso
nance  but the greatest reductions (in a and
        ;                                       will also have great             o)
compensations in the reduction of the  bulk of the  oral cavity.                                              1   n
no case,        probably, will the resonance                    of the      /         be carried very far
away from          the oral resonance                of the adjacent vowel, except per
haps    in ufu    ;     for u has often an oral resonance                              lower than that of
 any possible      /.      But note what             is    said below about u6n, etc.
      Very similar results hold good                         for       6,    when          placed     between
 identical vowels.            "We note again, however,                      in   reforenco        to tiOtt, that
 whilst the resonance               of   6    could not be carried below a- 880 v.d.,
 the oral resonances               actually recorded of u are only 314—287 v.d.

The gulf here apparent is not really so wide as it looks.                        Relatively
to most of the resonances              here studied, the resonances               of vowels
 are much less mobile          ;   but they are not all equally wanting in
 mobility.       Mobility increases in the same order that oral resonance
•decreases    —  t, e, a, o, u*       All the resonances of u yet calculated
 are    for isolated     u.  There can be no doubt that between conso
 nants     m   will show much higher oral                 resonances       than these.      It
 would not be hard to phonograph the syllable &u6, and show at
 once how far the 6 is able to            pull  the u resonance         upwards, and how
 far the u is able to pull the             6 resonance       downwards.         The consti
 tution of the glides in such           a   phonogram would also be              very inter
 esting.       So also, in their own degree,                 would     be phonograms        of
 6o6 and Odd       ; but the mobility of          i  and   e is relatively slight.
     The combinations of x and                  — ixi,    exe,   a^a, o^o,     u^m,   show a

¦further increase       in the intractability of the consonant, especially in
 x.     The resonance of x in a^a, o\o, uyu, can be heard to fall step
 by step, though hardly pari passu, with the fall of the oral
 resonance of the vowel, but in x, whether the adjoining vowel be
 close t or open t, close         e  or open     e,   or front a, the convenience           of
 articulating against the alveolar ridge is such that the x resonance
 is not drawn very far away in any case from the                         " neutral " value,
  due to that position, and estimated                 below for myself at 2500 v.d.
 "When       the oral articulation          and resonance          of the vowel are        far
  away from these, e.g., in the case of open                    e,   or front a, adjusting
  movements are needed, of some duration, and there will doubtless
  be two glides, of rising and falling pitch respectively, corresponding
  to them in the phonogram.
      The like combinations of f and              f   appear to exhibit a       still further
  decrease in the power of the adjacent vowel to make the resonance
  of the consonant conform to the oral resonance of the vowel.                              In
  the combinations isi,       ese,   ifi,  efe, this intractability of the consonant
  is not much observed,          because      all the    resonances      lie near together,
  in the four-accented        octave.        But this is by         no means     the case in
  the    other forms, asa,        oso,    iuw,   afa, ofo, ufu. In these there is a
  wide gap between the neutral resonance of the consonant, and the
  oral resonance        of the vowol; and the consonant refuses                       to give

way very far.             Under       these      circumstances there is a palpable on-
glide and off-glide added to the consonant, as described for x —
longest, of course, for u, and shortening                            for       o   and a successively.
     The       above     results     can       be    conveniently                  represented             in       their

                as a

     The higher          the position          of a consonant in the above list                                        is,
the more closely does                 the       oral resonance                     of the vowel succeed
in assimilating           the      resonance         of the consonant                           to itself       ;    and
the lower, the less closely.                     But in           the latter case the transition
is    not abrupt, but gliding, — much                             more     so than appears                      to the
ear.
     The other possible combinations of                             spirate             fricative      and vowel
need       not detain        us     long.        They         are        all       to     a     certain extent
more       complex cases, and had better wait until we have actual
phonograms to               work       from.             It       seems        likely           that   a        spirate
fricative,       beginning          from       silence,           will begin from the neutral
type,      where that           type      is    strong        ;    but     less          near to          it,   where
that type          is   weak.       But     as      it   approaches                the vowel the same
mutual influences will pass between them                                           as    in the case where
the vowel flanked the consonant on both sides                                             :    and     if   there      is

  any   great     difference      between         its    initial      and     final      resonance,
  there    will   be    a   gradual      change        in    the    resonantal           vibrations,
  right   through       the    consonant.           It    is    no    longer        a   continuant
  consonant,       consisting      of    similar        parts      repeated         many        times,
  but   a    gliding      consonant,        consisting        of     parts      gradually           and
  steadily changing.           But    it   is   not     a    <jlidc   in     the special         sense
  here  attached to         that   word — the sense               of a purely connective
  sound  ;  every part of it belongs               to the     consonant, because                every
  part of it contains           that     special       or specially          situated        friction
  and that special distortion               of the       resonance          which        make       the
  consonant.       Such      a  consonant, however, may also                          need a true
 glide to connect         it with     the     following        vowel, but           such     a glide
 never     contains     more     than     a    brief fading-off            or growing-up             of
 the characteristic friction           of the consonant.
     The case of the spirate fricative                 loading from vowel to                  silence
 is the reverse      of all this, and may he left for the reader to work
 out.    The case of a spirate fricative between dissimilar vowels                                    is
 the   case    most     frequently       occurring         in    actual speech           ;   and     in
 most   cases    it will      naturally      produce both             a    gliding       consonant
 and a pair of connective glides.
    Looking      back on the rude .sketch                 of connected           speech       which
 we are now able to put together,                     from      the     limited material             of
 vowels     and    spirate fricative          consonants,         we      are   struck by          the
 way in which all its elements                  tend to          link and       interpenetrate
each other.
    Sometimes       the    resonance      of the consonant becomes                      absolutely
identical with one resonance                of the adjacent vowel                 ;    sometimes,
again, two such resonances draw nearer without becoming identical                                      :
but even then the gap is bridged by a ladder of gradual                                    changes.
There is plenty          of room       for    such      ladders     ;    for   the      absolutely
inaudible glide, not             sec.   long, has room for scores of successive
resonantal waves, each differing imperceptibly from its neighbour.
    Bearing these facts in mind, it is possible to understand the view
which M. Marichelle has taken of consonants (op. cit., p. 128),
" Les
        periodes de la consonne, soumises a Taction continuellement
modificatrice de la fermeture ou de Touverture                               progressives,          ne
sont que les formes memes de la voyelle, plus ou moins alterees."

in    their character of independent,              self-sustaining sounds,             it   is
impossible       to endorse this statement in its literal meaning.                   But to
anyone starting from the phonographic end of the evidence, it
may well seem that the vowel so interpenetrates the consonant
 that the latter       is only a modification       of it.       But we       have seen,     I
 think, that the        consonant also interpenetrates the vowel, and lias
 also its own independent           acoustic  foundation.
     It  is unfortunate that         M. Marichelle's         beautiful enlargements
 do not     comprise     one single specimen        of    a  spirato fricative, either
 singly    or in combination, though         for/   at any rate, he lias evidently
 (note,    p. 87) some legible phonograms.             Only four of his           numerous
 diagrams contain any consonants at all                 :   they are phonograms of
 the combinations aja (Ft. aya), oka, ha,                 and      >ra    (Fr. oi). But j,
 k, h, and     to  are all too     complex to be taken             as    initial studies of
 consonant-sounds:          j is fricative,   but toned:        k is not toned, but it
 is   plosive,    and therefore essentially gliding              :  b    and    w  are both
 toned and gliding. None of these could bo profitably studied till
 the simpler case of the spirate fricatives had been dealt with. I
 am sorry that they can be only dealt with here so imperfectly.
  The    need     of precise    phonographic evidence is manifest in every
  detail: and even in principle there are probably lurking errors
  which will only be corrected by objective facts. Even there, how
  ever,   the refutation      of  a wrong hypothesis may at once reveal the
  alternative and true view of            the case.       The notes on which this
  article   is based were made        about four years ago, but they seemed
   to  be, in parts,      so perilously deductive — it seemed, in short, so
   rash   a   thing to construct phonograms a priori,                       when the      real
   thing   might be published         any day and        confute them — that they
   were laid    aside, to await objective confirmation.                    Direct objective
   confirmation       has   not yet come      ;  but   the     fine       phonograms just
    mentioned       have a certain        relationship,       though         disguised and
   broken, to       those   of the sounds studied here                 ;   and they have
    prompted me at length to publish these notes, in the hope chiefly
    that they may direct the attention of          those engaged on phonograms
    to these simplest consonants,        hitherto universally neglected,              though
    by far the      most   likely subjects for successful                analysis.    I   hope
    now, after this      necessary   preface,   to be able shortly to take up the
    more complex sounds which remain.

 Note on Crystalline Hydrates of Sodium Thio8ulphat».
        By W. W. Taylor, M.A., B.Sc.                       Communicated by Pro
         fessor    Crum Brown.
                                  (Road June 20, 1898.)
     During       the  winter session      I  had occasion       to  prepare several
 supersaturated solutions for lecture demonstration.                   Among them,
 was    a   solution made by fusing            crystals of sodium thiosulphate.
 Next day this solution had deposited                 a  considerable     quantity    of
 crystals, but had not solidified.            The crystals were separated        from
 the     liquid,    washed,      dried,   and     analysed.      Their   composition
 agreed      approximately       with the formula         Xa.,S.,03,  2H20.     Other
 crystals having this composition were then obtained by driving off
 part of the water from fused                crystals of the pentahydrate,         ami
 allowing      the solution to cool.
     They were analysed by conversion into sodium sulphate.

    In order      to find out the temperature condition for the            formation-
of this hydrate, a solubility curve was constructed from the data
given by        Mulder* and by Kremers.f                There appeared       to  be a
change      in the curve between 50' C. and 60°            C,    but the data were
insufficient to fix the temperature with accuracy.
    I  therefore made       a series of   solubility   determinations, extending
from    0°   C. to 100' C.       The form of apparatus           used  was   that de

  contact     with Na.,S.,03, 2 H20 ; and at 50° C. solutions were pre
 pared     in  contact with each of them, and found to have the same
 concentration.
      The analysis of the solutions was carried out                   as  follows: — A
 weighed quantity of the solution was made up to                    a known volume,
 and    portions of 10 c.c. were            titrated    with starch and standard
iodine.       The mean of two or more titrations was used in the calcu
 lation.

Tha     Freezing-Point of Aqueous Solutions of Sodium
      Mellitate. (Preliminary Note.) By W. W.Taylor, M. A.,
      B.Sc.     (Communicated by Professor Crum Brown.)
                              (Read   July   18, 1898.)
   As   is well known,      the molecular          depression of the          freezing-
point of aqueous solutions of electrolytes is greater than                 1 -87, van't
lloff's   constant,   with which       the    molecular        depressions     of non-
electrolytes have been found to agree extremely well.                      This is in
accordance      with the dissociation theory           ; and for binary electro
lytes the molecular depression            may approximate to 1'87 x 2, for
ternary     electrolytes to     1 -87 x 3, etc.,      but     cannot exceed        these
values.
    Substances     such as potassium ferrocyanide, which, according to
the dissociation theory, might be expected to give values approxi
mating to T87 x       4 or T87 x 5, have not been found to give mole
cular depressions greater than          I "87  x 3.     This    has been held to be
 an objection to the dissociation theory.
    At Professor Crum Brown's             suggestion,     I    have   determined the
freezing-point of aqueous solutions of sodium mellitate in order to
 ascertain    whether    its molecular         depression       approximates to the
 theoretical maximum,       l"87x7.
    Sodium mellitate was prepared             as follows     : — A slight     excess   of
 mellitic acid was added         to a boiling        dilute      solution  of sodium
 carbonate    ; after expulsion of the carbonic anhydride, the solution
 was    exactly    neutralised     with      pure dilute         solution   of sodium
 hydrate, using phenolphthalein            as indicator.         After concentration
 over sulphuric acid, crystals separated           out.     They were washed and
 twice recrystallised from water.
    Analysis    of the air-dried crystals gave numbers corresponding
 to the formula Na0C12012, 17H.,0.

    The formula         given in Beilstein's      Handbuch      der Organuchen
 Chemie, on the authority of Erdmann and Marchand,*                   is Na,.C12012)
18H20.         On reference to their paper, I found that the loss on
heating to 160° C. is stated to be 38'88 per cent., which closely
agrees    with    the formula given above.        As   at that time the formula
assigned to mellitic acid was C4H204,           the 38-88     per cent, loss was
nearer     6H20 than to 5II20.
    Erdmann and Marchand gave              no sodium estimation.
    The salt dissolves in water without               any indication      of hydro
lysis   ;  the most dilute solutions that were used were neutral to
phenolphthalein.
    The arrangement of the apparatus               was a modification of that
used by       Abegg.f
    The glass cylinder of 200 c.c. capacity was supported by cork
wedges      in  a metal     air-chamber, the depth of which              was   much
greater than that of the glass.
    The metal cylinder was fixed in the wooden lid of                        a  large
porcelain      cylinder,     which, in turn, was       surrounded      by    a  large
wooden box packed with waste.                The freezing mixture of pounded
ice,   salt, and water was placed in the porcelain cylinder, and the
temperature        remained constant to within 0-l° C. during a series
of determinations lasting several           hours.     The stirrer consisted        of
 a  platinum disc provided with two stout platinum                      wires fused
 into glass      tubes,    which    moved   vertically in    brass    slides.     The
 length of stroke of the stirrer was         easily adjusted to the        depth of
 liquid by means         of a movable eccentric on         the driving pulley.
 The stirrer was worked by an electric motor, and the rate was
 kept constant at 32 strokes a minute throughout                   all the experi
 ments.

On     the Electrolysis of Ethyl Potassium Diethoxy-
      succinate. By Prof. Crum Brown and Dr H. W.
      Bolam.
                              (Bead  July  18, 1S98.)
   The method of electrolytic synthesis of dibasic acids described
by Cram Brown and Walker has hitherto boen found to be
applicable to dibasic acids of the formula           CJl^    (COOH)2,    whether
normal or with      side   chains, and to camphoric acid, which is no
doubt   a  saturated cyclic      compound.         In all    other  cases   which
have   been tried the anion is oxidised and broken up.
   One of us long ago found that this was the case with tartaric
acid, and in 1894     v.  Miller and Hofer showed that when              the salts
of monobasic hydroxy-acids         are electrolysed       the anion is oxidised
and broken up.         They    showed that this is the case also with
methoxyacetic    acid, so that it would          appear that the replacement
of H   by OR', where R'      is an   alkyl,   leads   to the same destruction
of the anion   as does the replacement of          H by OH.        We examined
ethoxysuccinic    acid, and found that here also no ethereal layer is
formed on the electrolysis of the ethyl potassium salt.
   Very different    was the case     with diethoxysuccinic acid.
   Professor Purdie has      shown that it is possible to add the elements
of alcohol to fumaric and maleic ethers by               means    of sodium and
anhydrous    alcohol     (Tram. Cliem. Soc, 1885, vol. 47, 856, and
1891, vol. 59,   468).     He gave us permission to apply this method
to acetylendicarboxylic        ether,   where,      by   the   addition   of two
molecules of alcohol, diethoxysuccinic          ether should be formed.
   Acetylendicarboxylic       acid was prepared according to Baeyer's
directions  by the action of         alcoholic    potash on      dibromsuccinic
acid.   On treating this acid with alcohol and sulphuric                 acid the
acetylendicarboxylic      ester was obtained      in small quantity, the yield
being from 25 to 30%.
   The acetylendicarboxylic        ester   was then mixed with twice its
weight of alcohol, and then         a  small quantity        of sodium ethylato
dissolved in alcohol was added.             The solution usually remained
alkaline for 36 hours, and then        a  further    small quantity of sodium
was added.      After allowing       to stand at the ordinary          laboratory

256             Proceedings      of Roycd Society of Edinburgh,                  [sbs.
temperature for          10   days   the    solution was     still alkaline.      The
quantity of sodium added varied somewhat, but did not exceed                      one-
fifth of an atom of sodium to one molecule of acetylendicarboxylic
ester.
    On pouring into water an oil separated,                which was shaken         out
with ether, the ethereal solution dried over ignited sodium                 sulphate
and     the    ether distilled     off.     On    fractionating     under    reduced
pressure the whole of the product               came over     within two    or three
degrees, and the boiling           point was fully 25° higher than that               of
the acetylendicarboxylic            ester,   namely,      145-146°     at   17    mm.

    The     .same  diethoxysuceinic ether was obtained by the action                  of
 sodium      ethylate in alcoholic solution in the cold on dibromsuccinic
 ether,    prepared from fumaric acid by the action of bromine                     and
 subsequent       esterification.    Rather more than the calculated            quan

 a  fortnight.       Tin:   oil  thus got      boiled at 144-145°       at   16 mm.
 pressure.
     On hydrolysis        with alcoholic      potash   a  white pearly     potassium
 salt was formed, insoluble in alcohol, but easily                soluble in    water.
  From     the aqueous       solution the insoluble lead and calcium               salts
  were    prepared     by double decomposition.           Analysis    of these     salts
 gave numbers agreeing            fairly well with       the theoretical     numbers
 for salts of diethoxysuceinic acid.
     The diethoxysuceinic         ether prepared in these ways is the          unsym-
  m<^trical    body, the acetal derivative of oxal-acotic ether.              Michael
 and Bucher have already shown that this is the case (Ber.                       1895,
  2511).

 acetic acid.
    The half saponification of the diethoxysuccinic ether was effected
 in the usual way by means            of alcoholic potash       in the cold.       The
 ethyl potassium salt is easily soluble in alcohol and in water.
    Upon    electrolysis      of the concentrated        aqueous       solution,    the
number of volts being            12 and     of amperes       3  to 4, an oil was
formed, which was soluble to a slight extent             in  water.     This oil was
removed     with   ether,     and the ethereal solution dried over ignited
sodium     sulphate.     On     distilling off    the   ether    a  faintly    yellow-
coloured    oil was left, having        a  strong odour.       From     this oil, on
standing in the desiccator,           large rhombic plates crystallised out,
these were drained off, freed           from oil by pressing in filter paper,
and dried on porous tile.
    Anatysis    gave    numbers which         agreed    fairly closely with         the

Note on the Passage of Water and other substances
   through Indiarubber Films. By R. A. Lundie, M.A.,

                                   (Head December 20, 1897.)
     Indiarubber         lias come to be             so    nearly synonymous in popular
language with waterproof that it seems almost as much of                                  an imper
tinence to inquire whether it really is so, as it would                                   be to ask
whether lead is heavy or iron strong.                                 The question, however,
came before me           in    a   practical shape         ;   and     I   have made out        some
facts, in attempting to answer                  it,   which may bo of interest.
  A       water-bed      is   simply     a   hollow indiarubber mattress, capable                    of
being filled with water and secured                            by metal screws.           Such beds
are largely used in the treatment of paralysed and feeble patients                                   ;
and   it      is   well known        to nurses and others who have much                         to   do
with them that they                 need     every now and then to be filled                    up   in
order to keep them comfortable.                       I        first became acquainted          with
this fact in the course of medical work at the Longrnore Hospital,
where there are always many of them in use.                                  Every    three months
or   so   a   considerable quantity of water needs to be added                               to each
of them, because          it   becomes so slack that the. patient sinks through
the cushion of fluid and rests on the solid mattress                                  below,   at the
points where pressure              is   greatest.         It seemed        to me that this circum
stance was worth inquiring                   into.        Is   it   simply due to stretching         of
the material, or          is   there an actual transudation through the                        india-
rubber?            As    could get no answer to the question from                          people or
                   I I  determined to interrogate Xature for myself.

           the                              was enabled to per         I
form some experiments on the subject in the University Physical
Laboratory.
I      took some of the thin indiarubber balloons used                                as playthings,
filled them with water, secured                           the necks by          a   double tie with
strong thread, and weighed them from time to time.                                         Different
sizes and different makes were used, but all gave very similar results.

      It   was soon             evident that the balloons all lost weight at                               a rate
which was fairly constant for each under                                        the same conditions.
Some were                 exposed to the air of the room, some placed in                                        a
chamber kept saturated                          with water-vapour, and               some in a chamber
kept dry by sulphuric acid.                              The loss fell in the moist chamber to
is    or ?cr that            in ordinary air, and was more than doubled in                                    the
dry chamber                (see PI. figs. I. and II., and Tables A., B., F.).
     The thickness of the rubber films,                              in their distended condition,
varied from                O'l       to 0'025 mm.             The extremes           of the observations
made are as               follows      :    the numbers represent for twenty-four                           hours
the decrease              in radius of           the balloon in micromillimetres                    (fi   = metro
x
     10"'")   ;     or,    which       comes         to the    same thing, the amount passing
through per square metre reckoned                                  in cubic    centimetres     :
               In the air of the room                          .       .         .    11   and 32

These are the extremes recorded.                               For    each balloon the divergence
is   less.    The         loss was not proportional to the thinness of the rubber;
though the thicker balloons, on the whole, lost less than those of
thinner make.
     One of the balloons showed                          a   small leak when         it   had been filled       ;
it    occurred            to    Dr Knott         to close    it    with   a   piece of gummed              paper.
Next day             it        was    found       to have been            leaking     a    little
                                                                                                ;     but the
leakage ceased, and this one behaved afterwards                                       in the air of the
room       just like the others.
     It    seemed clear, then, that the loss observed was closely analogous
to    evaporation,              for   it    depended on the pressure of water-vapour in
the air surrounding                        the balloon, not upon the hydrostatic pressure
within        it,   which was practically the same under all the conditions.
      These experiments were all performed between the                                              19th    July
and the 6th October.                         This month (December)              I      find that similar
balloons of thickness                       0   025 mm. lose weight much more slowly —                          ¦
at    a    rate representing                4   to   6   cub. cm. per square metre per day, or
only about            1        of that which obtained with corresponding balloons
during        the         autumn.               This difference no doubt               depends            on the
lower temperature                     and consequent lower vapour-pressure of water,
under ordinary conditions, at this time of year.

260              Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                [sess.
    During this month           I   have also been making similar experiments
with indiarubber of greater thickness. With pieces of indiarubber
tubing, though        I   have found a gradual loss of weight in most cases,
I have     not had sufficiently satisfactory results to enable me to speak
of definite numbers           ;  but with football      bladders, about 0"5 mm.
thick in their distended condition,                I  find a loss of weight cor
responding         to an     escape     of from 0'75 to        3 cubic cm.    per sq.
metre per day.            I am    sorry  I did not try these thicker balloons in
summer, when higher temperatures                and larger differences in weight
 make the results more satisfactory.              But, taking and averaging the
 results that are comparable,             it appears   that rubber twenty times
 thicker than the toy balloons allows almost               \ as much water     to pass
 through it      ; the loss is     thus very far from inversely proportional to
 the thickness of the rubber.              This  suggests     that the resistance    to
 the passage of water through indiarubber                    is probably to a large
 extent a surface phenomenon, whether the obstacle be at the inner
 or the outer surface, or at both ; and that its diffusion through the
 substance       of the rubber is comparatively easy.
     I have     estimated,     from the rough data given me by the hospital
 nurses, that       in order      to explain   the slackening of the water-beds
 actually observed by leakage of water alone, it would be necessary
 to assume a rate of loss about as great as was found to occur from
 the thin balloons in ordinary air during summer                  ; and seeing that
 these     beds    are    made      of rubber at least      1   mm.  thick, it seems
  hardly likely that the transudation can be as rapid as this.                     The
  loss must, however, be rather greater              in a water-bed in actual use
  than in     a  laboratory experiment such as           I  have made at the same
  air-temperature       ;  for the temperature,        and therefore vapour-pres
  sure, of the water inside is raised a little by the body-heat of                  the
  patient lying upon it.
      Some escape of water through the indiarubber                    there certainly
  must be      ;  and it gives, at all events, a partial explanation of the
   usual behaviour of water-beds.
      I  thought it would be interesting to find out at the same time
  whether other liquids could also pass through the indiarubber films.
   I chose    alcohol, as it has no sensible action on indiarubber.
      On filling similar balloons with absolute alcohol and methylated
   spirit,  I  found that the loss was enormously greater than in the case

of water.           Here, however, it did not remain constant, as with the
water balloons, but showed              a steady and somewhat rapid diminution
at each weighing.              It  was influenced      in  the same direction, but to
a very      much less extent, by exposure to dry and to moist air                     ;   that
is to say,      it  was increased     a little in dry air,     and diminished in moist
air (see     PI.    fig. III.,   and Tables    K. and M.).          The clue to this is
probably given by an interesting and unexpected result.                           When        a
water      and spirit balloon        were placed together in the moist chamber,
the water balloon not only did not lose weight, but actually gained
slightly      ;   and on one occasion,          when one of the spirit balloons
happened           to burst in that chamber,          the gain of the water balloon
beside      it  was very considerable (fig.        I. B., and Table B.).        Similarly,
 no doubt, when a balloon containing alcohol is placed in an atmos
 phere      containing        water-vapour, water-vapour            passes through         the
 film    in  consequence        of the lower pressure of water-vapour within it.
 In    a  moist atmosphere          this effect must be increased,          and in a dry
 one abolished or reversed.
                                      ....
      Taking       the    first observations in the case of each balloon, the
 figures, reckoned in the same way as for water,                     are as follows     : —
                                                               Extreme rates of loss.
              For alcohol,                                       369/a and 516/x
              For methylated spirit,         .      .        .   339/* and 497/a
  — that      is to say, from 15 to 30 times as great as the loss of water
  under similar conditions.
       It was noticed in the course            of the experiments that while the
  outside of the balloons was free from pigment at the beginning of
  the observation, stains of the same colour as that with which                             the
  balloons       were     dyed frequently appeared             on the   paper on which
  they were standing;             and sometimes         there was sufficient colouring-
  matter on them to soil the fingers.                 I   therefore determined to try
   whether       any diffusion of salts in solution in water took place.                       I
   filled bladders         with strong solutions of            magnesium    sulphate and
   ammonium           chloride.     The former speedily began            to leak, appar
   ently from some chemical action of the sulphate on the indiarubber                           ;
   but the latter showed no leak, and in ordinary air lost weight just
    like the water-bladders.             They     were      then immersed in jars of
    water, and         there gained weight slightly             but steadily  ;  while the

 262          Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                   [ssss.
 water in the jar showed a slight             hut decided and constantly
increasing reaction to silver nitrate solution, showing the presence
pf a chloride in the water surrounding the bladder.
    These balloons began to leak by minute apertures three or four
 weeks after they had been filled.          But in spite of this, they           con
tinued to gain weight when immersed in water, though more slowly
 than before.
    I am   indebted to Professor Crum Brown for giving me references
 on the subject, especially to papers published           in  1866   by Payen*
 on the question of the permeability          of indiarubber,      in which        he
describes    experiments of the same kind with bladders filled with
water.      His  papers deal mainly     with the microscopic structure of
indiarubber, which he found to be penetrated by fine pores                   ;  and
he maintains the theory that these explain the well-known                   results
of Graham with regard to the diffusion of gases through india-
rubber, as against Graham's own theory that the gases pass through
the membrane       in a state of solution.
    Payen's balloons were, in their distended condition,           '5-1    mm. in
thickness, and the results varied with the state of the rubber.
   Pure (unvulcanised) rubber allowed 23 c.cm., vulcanised rubber
only 4 c.cm., to pass per square metre in twenty -four hours.
   The temperature       was   15°   C, not very different from the tem
perature at which my experiments were made in summer.                           The
rubber with       which   I   have worked       has   all   been   more   or less
vulcanised.
   With regard       to the explanation of the phenomena observed,                  I
would only remark : —
   (1) That though Payen finds pores in the indiarubber, he                    fails
to show that they are continuous throughout it.
    (2) That the fact that carbonic acid penetrates a rubber
                                                                         film,    far
faster than other lighter gases, even than hydrogen, seems                         to
require some other explanation           than is given by assuming               the
rubber to behave        merely   as  a porous    septum.
   To   summarise     my results, then,   I think   I have shown —
    (1) That indiarubber, at least in layers up to           05   mm.   thick, is
steadily, though slowly, penetrated by water.

    (2) That the rate of penetration depends upon difference of
pressure of water-vapour on the two sides of the indiarubber, not
upon hydrostatic pressure, and increases considerably with increase
of temperature.
    (3) That indiarubber  is similarly, but far more rapidly, penetrated
by alcohol.
    (4) That it also permits diffusion of some substances dissolved in
water.
    These facts may need to be taken into account in dealing with
indiarubber,   both in medical and scientific work.

     In geodetical and astronomical computations it frequently
happens that we have to use the logarithmic                                                          sines      or tangents of
small arcs, or to find the small angles                                                corresponding to their arti
ficial sines or tangents                    ;         and in all trigonometrical tables directions
are      given to guide the learner in these operations.                                                      It           might seem,
then, superfluous to refer to such a matter.                                                        A   variety of methods
in the solution of a simple problem has, however, sometimes advan
tages,      and the method                      I      have       been in the habit of using,                                             though
obvious enough, is not usually given.
     In Vega's           great      Thesaurus Logarithmorum                                             Completus                         (1794),
based on           A. Vlack's               Tables,              the   rules for the functions of small
arcs make use of second differences ;                                     * and the 7th and later editions
ofHutton's Tables (1830, 10th                                     ed., 1846) follow                      the same method.

closer approximation to x.          And for       arcs very near 0° or 90°    when
the functions vary rapidly and the use of third differences                  would
be required,      it is recommended        to find the      corresponding natural
sine, tangent, etc., for which          only first differences       are necessary,
and     then to find the logarithm           of this, in order to obtain the
correct values.        These processes are cumbersome.
   In Hutton's Tables (10th ed., p. xxxvii.) Maskelyne's rules, given
in his introduction to Taylor's Logarithms (1792), are stated as "often
useful," but no examples         of their use are given.           These rules are
quite empirical, but for small arcs, under 2°, they are very con
venient and accurate,         and have often been published, as in Gal-
braith's     Mathematical       Tables     (1827),      Shortrede's    Logarithmic
 Tables, etc.       They are expressed by the formula; —
           log. sin. a" = log. sin. 1" + log. a"     - ^(log. sec. a" - 10)
           log. tan. a" = log. tan.   1" + log. a" + g(log. sec. a" - 10).
 When     a = 5°, or    a"=  1800",   the error in the 7th place of decimals
                  is -5,611 or 0"-023;
     „    a =10°, the error in the 6th and 7th places of decimals is
                   - 90,428, or 0"-757      in sine and 0"-71    1  in the tangent   ;
     „    a=    10° 34', the  error in the 5th, 6th, and 7th places of deci
                  mals is  - 112,861, or 1" in sine        and 0"*966 in tangent     ;
     ,,    a = 15°, the error in the 5th, 6th, and 7th places of decimals
                  is - 463,445,   or 5"'9 in sine and 5"'5 in tangent, etc         ;
 the divergence       rapidly increasing above 10°.

   The method       I have   found most useful in all cases is nearly                  as
simple as this,     and does not require the use of the secant.                     It  is
represented     by
            log. sin. (a + x) = log. sin. a + log. (a + x)          - log. a  ;
            log. tan. (a + x) = log. tan. a + log. (a + x)          - log. a.
Where a and a + x may be stated                  in degrees, minutes or seconds,
and    decimals     of the    same      denomination          : Thus,    taking   Vega's
example,     to find the arc of which              5-6271691       is the log. sine, we
                            ....

   But, while the usual tables give the sines and tangents for each
second    up to about       2",  few of them give the values for seconds
beyond this, and some not even                 for the first      2°.    We may, how
ever,   apply this method with            a    correction that will enable us to
rind the values      for any    arc in the quadrant.
   For the sine we readily find                 the     difference between       5' + 60"

    This value is correct to the last figure of the decimal.
    For all     angles   to about      50°, but especially for those above               20 ,

           25°              + 403.13S
    To about 8° the correction would                  be   +14,8 per degree for       00 , or

    But for larger         arcs, the above differences               do not yield a simple
empirical     formula,* and as the log. cosine is easily obtainable by
the usual process,           it is better,      in  cases where extreme accuracy is

On the Theory of Archimeric Segmentation and its
   bearing upon the Phyletic Classification of the
   Cvelomata. By A. T. Masterman, D.Sc.
                                       (Read    June       0, 1898.)
  In       a    recent        paper   embodying the results of my work                             upon
Actinutivcha*             1    was led to suggest            a   theory of the segmentation
of coelomate             animals, the essential                  features of which             were      as
follows : —
  1.    There can be demonstrated, in the morphology of the Celo-
mata, two distinct types of segmentation                           —
                                             (a) a primitive or archi
meric type, having in its constitution certain evidences of a radial
origin, and        ('<)   a secondary or metameric segmentation,                             superposed
upon the former and bearing evidence of                                a   bilateral origin.
  2.    A       certain number of the Cwlomata retain, under varied                                    dis
guise, the archimeric segmentation throughout life, together                                      with      a
number of other primitive                    characters           in common.             These   groups,
being genetically                allied,   may        bo    conveniently          classified     in    one
division, for which the name Archi-calomata                                     is proposed.
   3.      In   the truly segmented             animals, such as the Annelida, Arthph
pod a, and En-chorda, the bilateral or metameric segmentation                                            (of
the posterior archimeric segment)                          tends    to completely replace               the
archimeric.              In    at least    two of these groups                  there    has been        an
independent evolution of metameric                            segmentation.
   In attempting                to bring forward            facts in support of tliis            theory,
one may approach the subject from three stand-points.
      (A.)      Firstly,      an attempt may be made, by general                          reasoning,      to
construct        a   hypothetical ancestor of the Codomaia                          as   a   group.      In
this way may be obtained                    a   schematic         outline of an organism               pos
sessing each system of organs in its most archaic condition.
      (B.) Secondly, taking this                 as   a    central typo of the organisation
of the Arclii-cwlomata,                   several of the lower divisions of the                       coelo-

 mate   animals may be shown to possess a greater or less number of
 these  features, such that they will naturally fall together under the
one   major division, conveniently termed the Archi-ccelomata. These
features may be morphological or ontogenetic.
    (C.) Thirdly, evidence may be derived from morphology and
from ontogeny of the metamerically segmented                      groups that a
secondary segmentation has been phyletically                superposed     upon the
primary.        Thus, these      animals may be shown to pass through
ontogenetic      stages which      closely resemble the archi-ccelomate         type
(and, in consequence,        some of the Arehi-calomata),         and to possess
in their morphology more or less vestigial traces             of the archimeric
segments.
    (A.) In the classification of the THplohlastira the only sound
hasis of phyletic value upon which to rest is the condition of the
mesoderm       or third layer, and bound up with this              is the   ccelome
and its segmentation.          It is impossible to enter here into the whole
discussion     of the theories with respect to the primary origin of the
ccelome,    but   I  would adhere      to that originally    propounded by Mr
Sedgwick* as the most in harmony with the facts of morphology,
ontogeny, and physiology.
    Its essential feature is " that the somites of segmented                animals
are   derived from gut pouches,             which    are homologous with         the
pouches of Cwlenterata."
    Not only are there       a great    number of morphological and onto-
logical facts which point to the truth of this hypothesis, but it is
confirmed      by physiological considerations.          Thus, the pouches        of
the    Actinozoa      present special differentiations        of    the   primitive
endoderm, the walls of which              perform the functions of the mus
cular and reproductive systems, and the cavities of which contain
a  nutritive circulatory fluid.          In  the lowest Culomala       the ccelome
 performs precisely the same series             of functions, and only differs
 essentially   from the      'pouch' of the        Cedent (rata   by its loss     of
 organic continuity       with    the   endodermic gut-wall, whilst          in the
 history   of   the ccelome      in   the   higher    Cwlomaia    each     function
 becomes    differentiated and confined to        a special  area of the organ,

    I  allude in particular to the suggestion that the coelome is to be j

 that a mass of reproductive cells have, in the course of phyletic                              \
 history, lost their sexual specialisation and given rise, in the same
 individual, to muscles, connective            and other mesodermic             tissues of
 the differentiated coelome, there is surely no impediment to assum
 ing that the Cwlentcrata have been derived from the Cn Jomata, or

     Intimately bound up with Mr Sedgwick's theory of the                          coelome
 is that of      the   blastopore.       To quote          the   author's words — " it
  necessarily    follows    (from the         consideration of           the    Peripaiu*
  embryo) that        the  mouth and          anus      of    the    Triploblastica      are
  derived from the gastnea            mouth,       i.e., coelenterate      mouth." *        I
  need not quote the arguments            which were adduced              for this theory
  by its author     ;  but, since it was suggested,              further    research has
  only afforded     additional evidence in its favour,             f
      This mode of derivation of the triploblastic                     mouth and       amis
  assumes     the   existence    of   a    radial     coelenterate      ancestor    of   the
  Cwlomata.        In other   words,     an organism          in which the parts       were
  arranged     in radial symmetry, about              an axis passing        through     the
  mouth to the aboral pole.              We, therefore,         go no further than the
  theory to suppose        that the gut-pouches              were    also radial, which
  implies that their number must have been at least three.                            Their
  possible number appears to lie between                  three, four, and five.        The
  higher numbers,       which are multiples of either of these, must                   have
  been derived from a prior stage with the lowest factor, whereas                           a

simplest factor,             i.e.,       three.         We     are,      therefore, left with the
tetraradiate and pentaradiate forms of symmetry for consideration.
     All
      the lowest forms {Coelenterata) present a tetramerous sym
metry, both pelagic and sedentary, whilst the Eehinodermata are
the great pentamerous                     group.        Besides being of higher organisa
tion than the Coelenterata, these forms give evidence of owing their
pentamery to           a sedentary           past and a peculiar hypertrophy                      of one
side   of    the bilateral ancestor.
     As the hypothetical form we                              are discussing          must    have been
a    Coelenterate           or little above             it,   we are apparently justified               in
assuming        that   it    was tetramerous.
     As     regards        the   habitat of this organism,                      its radial symmetry
indicates either            a    pelagic or sedentary existence,                       and there are
numerous        reasons          for holding that              it   was the former.            Brooks *
has insisted upon                  the    importance of the pelagic                    habitat    as   the
dwelling-place of the primitive                         types, and on this assumption                  the
pelagic stages of the littoral fauna acquire                              a   phyletic significance.
      Some time ago         t      several reasons were                  adduced   for regarding tho
pekgic ontogeny of certain of the fishes to be primitive and of im
portant phyletic significance, and the demersal                                 type of ontogeny to
be     secondarily acquired.                 The same considerations apply to                    a   largo
extent       to the invertebrate                  forms with pelagic               larva?.     Amongst
these,      perhaps,         the     most     important             is   that   the    typical    pelagic
ontogeny        is   without yolk,           a    secondary means of nourishment which
cannot have its phyletic equivalent.                            As       an important factor in the
 recapitulation        of phyletic history an egg must, by the nature of the
 case, have         no yolk, and must, from its earliest existence,                               obtain
 its own nutriment,                  so that, as these              conditions are most           nearly
 approached           in    a    typical      pelagic         ontogeny, wo are justified                in
    regarding   the pelagic habitat as primitive.
      Lastly, we are attempting to follow the evolution of tho highest
    and most    progressive types of living beings, and                          it   is   very question
    able how    far   it    is   possible         for   organisms            which have to any con
    siderable extent adapted themselves                          to      a   sedentary existence,       to
    again become free,           and thereafter attain the highest position in tho

have     again acquired a locomotor habit                  tend to    show that the
loss of organs undergone during               the sedentary stages       is irremedi
able   and limits the further          advance      in differentiation.       In   other
words, as has been recently pointed out,* we have no proof that
organs once lost have ever been re-evolved.
    It therefore follows that although there are numerous instances
of sedentary types again assuming                 a pelagic or    littoral existence,
yet the ancestral history of such forms as the Arthropwla and
 CJiardata     probably     has    been   passed      in   the  pelagic or littoral
regions.      In   the case of this earliest coelomate ancestor, its radial
symmetry        leaves   us   no    choice between these           two;      a  pelagic
environment is the only possible                alternative.
    We     are   therefore led to regard the remote                 ancestor     of the
 Cmlomaia       as having      been     a  radially     symmetrical       tetramerous
 ccelenterate    with   a ventral axial       mouth (with functions of mouth
and anus) and four gut-pouches separating off from the alimentary
                                                                                          '

    X By this it is not implied that this organism was morphologically compar
 able to the medusw of the present day.          To this view (Kleinenberg, Balfour)
 it has been objected by Korschelt and Heider (pp. 342-343, English transla
 tion) that the medusa presents a higher type of locomotion, and we may add
 of ingestion. Another indicated difficulty is the absence, in medusa", of an
 apical nervous system.      It has been assumed below that the apical ganglion
 was present in the pelagic coelomate ancestor, and that in such a form as the
 trochosphore    it has become secondarily shifted to the new apical pole at the
 apex of the pre-oral lobe.       For figure of this Stage I., see Quart. Journ.

in the two radii at right angles to them.                 If we  assume the former
presence of an ectodermal involution                (coelenterate   stomodseum),    as
in the Acfiniaria, then the fusion of the walls in two radii would
leave the ectoderm        as a pair of ectodermal funnels, the metazoan
stornodaeum      and proctodaeum,           connected with        the functions     of
ingestion and egestion         respectively.       In   ontogeny, the stornodaeum
and proctodaeum       would naturally arise as separate invaginations.
   Thus a secondary axis, from mouth to anus, is believed by many
morphologists      to have been acquired          in the history of      the Metazoa
(Heteraxonia), and accepting             this  as a   theory with    a great  amount
of probability,     we may inquire as to the further fate of the four
coelomic pouches.
   The acquirement of the secondary axis of symmetry implies                         a
rearrangement of the organs                 bilaterally    about   this axis, more
especially as the differentiation           of an ingestive aperture implies a
locomotion     in that direction.         There are, as far as       I can see, only
two   alternatives     with     regard to       the arrangement of the           four
ccelomic pouches      in relation     to the new axis of symmetry.             Either
the axis   will  correspond      to the septa between the coelomic pouches
and the     latter   will   become      symmetrically       arranged as a pair of
anterior    and   a  pair of posterior pouches,            or the axis will corre
spond to the centre         of  a  pouch, and they will become arranged
so  that one will be pre-oral, two as paired lateral, and another
post-anal.
   Of these two alternatives there can be little doubt that the latter
is the correct one.        So far as     I know,     all the Actinozoa except the
Antipatlmria       have the terminal mesenteries              arranged in pairs on
other side     of the main axis,          and in the medusae          {e.g., Aurelia,
Lucernaria, etc.), in which the mouth shows a tetramerous sym
metry,    it is in   the   axes intersecting         the gastro-vascular pouches
(per-radial).     Thus we have some justification               for supposing that
upon the assumption of bilateral              symmetry about an oro-anal axis
the  four primitive       coelomic     pouches     became     arranged so that one
was   pre-oral,   two were lateral, right and left, and one was post
anal.    In  correlation to this, the ccelomate ancestor will present a
 body of three segments,          one pre-oral and two post-oral.             Organs
arising  in  these segments        will at this      stage be symmetrical about
 the long axis,     and others which, like the ccelomic pouches,                  had

progression of the alimentary canal until the anus was terminal.
       Primitively,          each of the archicceles               will   open to the exterior by                  a
monocytic egestive                opening, in connection with                         which an             ecto
dermal excretory canal will be secondarily acquired, thus forming
primitive nephridia.              t On the assumption of bilateral symmetry                                   the
protocoulic            and metaccelic       nephridia will become secondarily                           paired,
and as the gonads                become         confined to the metacades                     (as pointed
out below), the metaccelic                  nephridia alone               will continue to            function
as gonaducts.                These three pairs of arehi- nephridia are to be found
surviving          in such        varied organs           as       proboscis-pores,          collar-pores,
nephridia, and even as oviducts.                               Those forms which retain                       the
mesocadic              pores (collar-pores of Balanoglosmut,                       and C?j>haIoditcut,
and stone canal of Echinodermata),                                 as   a rule, have the metaccelic
pores completely metamorphosed                           into oviducts, whereas those                     forms
which lose their collar-pores (Brachiojioda,                                  Phoronis),             as a rule,
retain the metaccelic nephridia with gonaducal functions.
       Let     us now inquire into the condition of the ccelomic pouches in
this Stage             III.*    The protoccele is pie-oral, and is therefore in                               the
most disadvantageous position for the                                   direct supply of nutrition
from the alimentary canal, and the metacceles, enveloping the                                                 gut
for their whole length at                   a     part where digestion is effected, will
be         in the most advantageous               position.             Their walls will              therefore,
be         bathed with nutritive fluids supplied direct from the alimentary
processes.              The mesocceles will in this respect,                  as    in that of         location,

be intermediate          in character.       The reproductive cells will, there
fore, be no      longer found in the protocoele, but will be confined to
the metacoeles        ; whilst, on the other hand, the protocoele will lose
the   reproductive function and will be entirely devoted to muscular
differentiation.          In other words,       the protocoele      will become more
'animal' or katabolic in form and function, the metacoeles more
anabolic.        One curious anatomical peculiarity follows from this —
the    circulatory vascular system not being             as  yet fully differentiated
 the main      excretory organ will be in connection with the protocoele,
 where     the metabolism is most             active, and not as in the highest
                                                                     '        '
 animals, in the metacoeles, which in them form the                    animal    organs.
 I  have    attempted to show elsewhere* that the function of excre
 tion primitively          arises in the ectoderm,       and in this hypothetical
ancestor, the ectoderm of the stomodoeum                  probably came into close
 connection      by an invagination with the protocoele and the vascular
sinus     in its neighbourhood.             This primitive excretory organ may
 be termed       the subneural gland.           We have now two important sets
 of organs      the evolution of which are yet to              be   followed, namely,
 the vascular       and the nervous          systems.    They may well        be   taken
 together,     for they      are intimately connected.         In   the paper already
 referred to, an attempt has been made                  to show      that the vascular
 system arises phyletically as a system of spaces between                  the limiting
 epithelia, ectoderm and endoderm,                and the mesoderm,       and that the
 vascular      fluid is primarily         excretory in function.          The nervous
 areas being,      by their very nature, areas of active metabolism,                their
  course    is largely followed by the vascular vessels immediately below
  them.
     In   Stage    I.   the nervous system         must   have    been upon a radial
  principle,     and although,       as  in the present     day pelagic Orient' rata,
  consisting of a diffuse nervous plexus in continuity                   with   the ecto
  dermal epithelium,           was probably concentrated           in certain    areas in
  relation to the ciliary ingestive and locomotory organs, and had a
  tetramerous arrangement, four inter-radial nerves meeting a ring
   round the edge.           Where the four radial nerves meet at the aboral
   pole  it is reasonable to suppose, from the analogy of Cteruiphora,
   that a central ganglion would be developed.                    Immediately below
   this ganglion would be the principal              blood-sinus (subneural sinus),

and from this would lead four inter-radial sinuses below the nerves.
On the assumption of bilateral symmetry, as described, two of                               the
radial nerves, with part of the ring nerve, would form                   a pre-oral band,
the other two between mesocoeles and metacoele would form a post-
oral band, whilst the rest of the ring-nerve would form ventral cords
and       a  post-anal ring.         These    three    nerve-rings        are   connected
with the formation of three archimeric ciliated bands which, sooner
                                       or later, replace       the   diffuse ciliation         of
                                       earlier stages    ; one     of these is pre-oral,
                                       the prototroch (syn. cephalotroch), and
                                       two post-oral, the mesotroch (or brau-
                                       chiotroch) and the metatroch (peri-anal).
                                          These bands do not persist in present-
                                       day Archi-caelomata, but are found in
                                       their     ontogenetic stages.           The       main
                                       ganglion would be moved forward into

                                       organ, the protoca'le, and the sub-neural
                                       blood-sinus      would        follow     the      same
                                       course.

     We can, however, find evidence             of its existenco,    and more espe
cially of its leading        feature, that of archimeric segmentation             and
its attendant phenomena,            in  the anatomy and ontogeny of present-
day species.
     (D.) We are thus led to the general                 characters     of the Arclti-
adomata as follows : —
                                     Morphological.
     1.  Body divided into three more or less clearly defined segments,
 one    pre-oral and two post-oral.
     2.   Mesoderm        forming     ccelomic    cavities corresponding to the
 archimeric     segments,      and primitively        opening to the exterior by
 ciliated ducts.      The first or protocoele is essentially muscular, sensory,
 and locomotive, and is present throughout                   life or only in early
 stages,   — the   second or mesoccele connected          with food ingestion and
 primarily produced into a series of post-oral tentacles which may
 (Braehiostoma)         or may not persist         (Balanoglossus, Chcttognatha),
 and may, upon atrophy            of the protomere,        assume the locomotory
 function      (Echinodermata), — the third or mctaccele                    connected
 primarily with the gonads and the vegetative functions.                      A chon-
 droid mesoblastic         skeleton is of very general occurrence.
      3.  Xervous system mostly in continuity with the ectoderm,                   and
 consisting     of   a  protomeric ganglion (brain),          a mesomeric     ganglion
  (sub-oesophageal),        and   a   post -oral,    mesomeric,     ring   connecting
  them.      A diffuse plexus in          parts,    and  more    or   less prominent
 metameric       bands,     which are unsegmented.
      4.   Vascular      system,    if   present, very      simple,     consisting   of
  sinuses    between the cuelomic          epithelia (dorsal and ventral trunks
  and    a post-oral ring-sinus), and a central archimeric heart or sub-
  neural sinus,     in  close connection with which there           may or may not
  persist the     primitive      archimeric      excretory organ,       or sub-neural
  gland.
      5.  No indication of      a true metameric segmentation.
      6. Gonads      arise from wall of metacceles, and in some cases have
   idiodinic   ducts (probably         derived    from metaccnlic       nephridia), in
   others, the metaccelic      nephridia function       as gonaducts.

                                               Ontogenetic.
     1.   Those species with larval                       forms     have        simple     larvae,    with
the hody divided up into three segments,                                one       pre-oral and two
post-oral.
     2. The    mesoderm            arises         by archenteric invagination,                 or by a
simple modification of it.
     3. There      are     often in the free swimming                       larvse three        ciliated
bands, one pre-oral and two post-oral.
     In   order that species                  retaining         this archimeric          segmentation
should have survived, they must of necessity have adopted certain
habitats, in which              naturalists are wont to find primitive                               forms.
In    this category         are pelagic, deep-sea,                   burrowing and sedentary
habitats, and amongst the animals affecting these are found forms
agreeing      with our type.                  In    the    case of sedentary animals,                   the
degeneration and great                    anatomical             modification          involved,      often
disguise,     in     the    adult,        the       features wo wish              to    find, but       the
ontogeny comes to our assistance.
                                   Chcetognatha                {Pelagic).
     The isolated position and primitive characters of this group are
usually acknowledged, and in their anatomy we find the coelome
divided into paired protocceles, mostly muscular, paired mesocceles,
and paired mctacoeles (fig.                        1).    The mouth         is   terminal, and the
protocoeles are greatly reduced.                          The mesocneles are predominant,
and contain the female                   sexual elements,             which may be correlated
with the post anal position of the mctacoeles, in which the male (or
katabolic) sexual elements arise.  This condition may be      primi                            a
tive survival of Stage                 II.,   but    is   more    likely    a   return to this con
dition from Stage               III.    by    a    movement formed of the alimentary
canal and anus, correlated with                          the    muscular development of the
mctacoeles      as   a     means         of locomotion              through the tail-fin,             as   is
paralleled in the fishes.
     The nervous system                  presents         the central ganglion in the proto-
mere, the post-oral ring, and the mesomeric                                 ganglion, all in con
tinuity with the ectoderm.
     The ontogeny          is   usually regarded as direct, but the coelome still
arises by archenteric diverticula.                         The protocceles are derived from

 these    diverticula by constriction,*             and   how the mesocceles and
 metacoeles are separated       from each other
 does not     appear    to have      been      clearly
 made out.
    Altogether, the anatomical evidence
is   in favour of regarding the Chcetog-
natha as animals which have                 retained
a  primitive pelagic habitat and a primi
tive archimeric segmentation,! although
both the anatomy and ontogeny show
some     deviations from the original type,
in the addition of sets, lateral and tail-
fins, and sense-organs.          It   is interesting
to    note   that   Gourret    J     describes       an
excretory      organ in the head.
    The peculiar backward extension of
the    archenteron, resulting in a division
of the metaccele into two parts, appears
to    point to    a former extension of the
alimentary canal to the posterior end,
and agrees with the theoretical explana
tion given       above,   of the fact that in
the     Archi-coelomata      the      metacoele       is
frequently paired.

band, one pre-oral and two post-oral, and the ca-lomic cavities                   of

process.      In Tornaria      the three bands  — the prototroch,     mesotroch,
and metatroch— can be discerned, and the development of the five
cculomic elements       appears to be reducible to the type of archenteric
diverticula.       The full significance of Tornaria will          be  discussed

into three parts, consisting of (1) the pre-oral epistorne, which is
greatly elongated laterally, (2) the rest of the lophophore, pro
duced laterally into two arms, which have cirrhi or tentacles,                and
(3) the rest of the body (see figs. 4 and 6).            These three segments
can be directly compared           to the three archimeric segments.        Each
contains     a special  section of the coelome, the relationships of which
to each other have been carefully worked out in Crania by               Joubin.*

 into this sinus, and hence into the protoccele.
     In this manner both        the protoccele and the mesocoeles no longer
 open to the exterior, but communicate            secondarily with the meta-
 cceles,  which, on their part, lead to the exterior by the           'nepbridia'

a simple nervous system which at least in some (Argiope,                Shipley)*
is  in continuity      with the     ectoderm.     It  consists,   typically, of a
protomeric ganglion (supra-oesophageal)             a post-oral mesomeric     ring
with   one or two mesomeric         ganglia (Van Bemmelen,t Jouhin), from
which the posterior part of the hody is supplied with simple nerves.
The arms of the lophophore, consisting of epistome (protomere) and
mesomere, are supplied by nerves from both the supra- and the sub-
oesophageal ganglia       (Van Bemmelen).
    The vascular system,       if existent,  is in the rudimentary condition
(Blochmann,|      Hancock      §)  of simple sinuses     between the coelomic
walls, or splits in the mesenteries.             In   several   forms there has
been described,     between     the protocoele and the mesocoele,        a compli
cated peri-cesophageal       sinus or plexus of sinuses, which is in direct
connection with, and forms the posterior part of, the protocoele, with
which the blood system             comes   into connection.        More definite
knowledge is required upon this point, but it is possible that further
research   may reveal      a trace    of the archimeric heart or subneural
sinus in this position.           (C/., specially Shipley, loc. cit., pi.       39,

the adult, at least,       there appears      to be no trace      of  a subneural
gland.
    The gonads     are confined       to  the metacoeles and the metaccelic

prove the annelid affinities of the group (fig. 12).             This comparison

   There are two difficulties to be mentioned.             The coelomic pouches
have not been described as breaking             up into four archicoeles, and
hence the larval segments         are not considered as segments by some.

condition of the mesoderm,                      as   in fig.   13.      Apart,      however, from
these doubtful             examples,      it   has been        seen that the mesoderm                   in

correspond in major details with the segments                                  derived from            the
larval segments.

 follow from before backwards           along the primary axis as normally
 as in   any chaetopod larva, and apart from the fact that the rneta-
 meres are perhaps         bent   upon themselves,      their inter-relationships
 are   unaltered in the adult.         The Brw.hiupoda         are   still placed by
 some    writers with the Tolyma and Phoronis,                as the Mulluscoida
 (<•/., Hatschek), and it is interesting that at least one specialist                on
 the group,    Van Bemmelen*          regards   them as allied to the Ctiadog-
natha.       Mr Shipley,! in criticising his        arguments,       points out that
 there    are  no lophophore, shell, or stalk, in the               latter.    On the
theory here put forward             we must    assume    that the Ctuetognatha
are an     ancient group which have remained in                  a  free swimming
pelagic     habitat,    and     the  Brachiopoda,      another archaic          group,
which has,     for  an enormous      period,  become adapted          to a sedentary
existence.
    The presence of a ventral pedicle of attachment, the lophophore
and shells     may be legitimately        connected with the adaptation to
a  sedentary    environment.         We are justified in this assumption by
a  comparison     of Balanoglossus and Cephalodiscus,              and their respec
tive    habitats.
    The Cephalula         larva, representing the neo-embryonic stage of
Hyatt, reminds one, in many features, of the typical Archi-codomaia,
and     is evidently     its phyletic    equivalent.       After this       stage   the
development       diverges from all other known             types, so that we are
justified    in supposing that       the Brachiopod       group only meets the
rest of the    Cwlomata at the archi-ca'lomate st;ige.
                                   Echinodermata.
    The Echinodermata          are usually regarded as owing their radial
 symmetry      and some other features           to a descent       from sedentary
 ancestors.     There appear in the greatly modified present-day                 forms
 to be representatives       of the right and left rnetacoeles, the left (and
 right?) mesocoele, and even the protoecele (axial sinus, parietal
 canal).

simple,     and the gonads are confined to the metacoeles, possibly to
the left metacoele.*          Here,  as in the  Archi-clwrda, the      gonads open
directly to the exterior, and the metacoele                no   longer has paired
nephridial       openings.      The vascular system when present consists
of simple inter-coelomic          spaces, and there appears to be a trace of
the archi-coelomate        central blood-space,     though there is some doubt
as to the true nature of the organ,           t   As in Phoronis and Brachio-
poda,     so here the    nco-embryonic stage of the free swimming larva
(Dipleurtda)       forms   a  culminating point in the elaboration of organs
upon the bilateral archi-coelomate           type.     The larval forms      will  be
referred to later, but we need only note here that there is clear
evidence of the penta-coelomic           condition of the mesoderm.
     The anterior enteroccele         or protoccele     was   first recognised,     I
believe,     by Bury   %  as such, and the presence of two hydrocceles or
mesocceles by Metschnikoff            in certain larval forms, whilst the two
metacoeles have always been easily identified.
     Bury,§ however, in        the construction of his free        ancestor   of the
Echinodermata does not appear to recognise the presence of a well-
developed        pre-oral lobe or protomere,         and indicates the anterior
enterocosle as no more prominent in this stage than in some of                    the
present-day Echinodermata.              Macbride|| has, however, by a happy
comparison of the            anterior enterocoele and hydrocele with the
proboscis-cavity and left collar-cavity of Balanoglomis respectively,

becomes vestigial, the mesomeres (or, more                probably, only the      left
one) become         much branched, and serve first as ingestive organs,

    In    the adult the hody-form, as           in   the Brachiopoda, has under
gone great        modification, and differs little from fig. 4 in general
features, whilst fig. 6 shows the inter-relationship                of the archicoeles.
As in Brachiopoda, the            protocoele      communicates       secondarily with
the mesocaeles, and the metacuelic               pores are nephridial         and gona-
ducal.
     The simple nervous system,            in continuity         with    the  ectoderm,
 with     a  protomeric     ganglion and a post-oral nerve-ring, and the
arrangement of the vascular system,                    are   all in   close   agreement
 with the      archi-coelomate   type.     The true zoological position of this
 group will be discussed          in  a paper upon its anatomy now                in    the
 course of completion, so that its claims to be considered one                    of    the
 Archi-coelomata can alone be dealt with.
     The actual fate of the five archiccDles                in Actinotrocha has         not

dently acquired.        These comprise        the   reduplication of the gut (which
is   apparently      dorsal in Phoronis,           Ectopror.la, and     Brachiopoda,
but ventral     in Entoprocta),      a reduction       of the protomere   to a vestige,
the   epistome, or to extinction, and               the  forward projection of        the
tentacular processes       of  the mesomeres to        form a lophophore.       It is not
difficult to derive these characters               as directly due to the environ
ment of a       sedentary animal, by a consideration of types like the
Cirripedia, Tunicata, Sipunevlids,                and the groups      under consider
ation.
    Such being the case, the systems               of classification which depend
upon such      characters as these are of the same nature                  as  those    in
which     all triploblastic       forms of an elongated             type  aTe    thrown
together     as   Vermes.
    Thus all the community of structure                  in  the Mollmcoida,      which
to not  directly traceable to         a  similarity of environment, is no more
than that     which exists in         the other phyla of the Archi-codomafa
cited here,     and this fact, taken in conjunction with the consider
ation   that there are very marked differences                   in structure in      the
groups,    justifies    us in assuming        that the Drarhiopoda, Ectoprocta,
and   Phoronida       are separate phyla of the Archi-coelomuta.
    The evidence with regard to the Entoprocta is somewhat of the
same    nature     as  that in the case of Rotifera and Sipunculids, to                 be
referred to later.

    In connection with            the    gastroea theory       of Haeckel,    there    are
shown to be         in   existence     a   great number of animals, which, ex
tremely      diverse in habits and in structure, yet retain the diplo-
Llastic    structure of the gastrula,            as   an underlying      basis of their
organisation.         These animals, in their own ontogeny,                  do not     by
any means,         without     exception, show the typical mode of forma
 tion of this diploblastic         condition, the second          layer being formed
 in different cases by unipolar              or multipolar ingression,       by delami-
 nation or by true embolic invagination.
     In  the case in point       it will not      be necessary     to the truth of the
 theory here put forward,             that all the forms which have an archi

 should show an ontogeny in which the mesodermal               layer or ccelome
 is formed in the phyletic manner.           At  the same time,     it is remark
 able   to find that most       of the Archi-cwlomata       agree  in  one parti
 cular method of mesoderm formation.
     As early      as 1876  Huxley    suggested   an alliance of the Entero-
pneusta, Echinodermata,          Brachiopoda,     and Chcttognatha together
under the title Enterocwla,          to emphasise    the development of the
 ccelome     in   these groups by archenteric diverticula.*         In Plioronu
 there is said to be a modified form of this method         t and   the develop
 ment of Cephalodiscus         is unknown.      In the Mollusca the         meso
derm is broken up and largely replaced by blood-spaces,                    and in
many of them an archenteric method of mesoderm                     formation       is
pursued.
     From the preceding portion dealing with the suggested derivation
of the mesoderm         of the Archi-coelomata from archenteric diverti
cula,   it  is evident that for     a correct repetition     of phylogeny the
archimeric segments         or their mesodermic      elements should arise as
follows : — Four diverticula of the gut should arise in a horizontal
plane — one pre-oral, two lateral, and one post-anal.            The post-anal
should then divide into two to form          a pair of metacceles.
    This method is closely followed by such             a type as Balanorjlot-
siis, in the demersal larva of B. KowaJevski.
    The other Archi-caslomata do not, as far as is known, derive their
mesoderm        in such a typical manner, but    if this method of formation
be assumed to be the primitive          and phyletic one, it is not difficult
to derive the other methods of mesoderm-formation as modifications
due to secondary        ontogenetic processes.
    According       to our theory, the axis of radial        symmetry in the
primitive      ccelomate    corresponded    with   the   central axis of         the
archenteron, and the four archimeric coelomic pouches                arose   sym
metrically to this axis and at the aboral end.
    On the assumption of bilateral symmetry, the main axis of the gut
by an elongation in one direction came to lie in           a  horizontal plane,
and hence at right angles to the archimeric axis of symmetry.
    In  a  truly phyletic ontogeny this     change should be brought        about
by an elongation of the blastopore in the direction at right angles

to the axis     of the     gastrula and the closure             of its intermediate
portion to form a pair of apertures,          the mouth and anus.
    In  ontogeny,     especially in larval forms, the assumption                of the
secondary axis of the gut is greatly hastened,                   so that the blasto
pore instead     of  becoming     closed    in this manner, becomes carried
over to form    the mouth or anus alone,            the other aperture       (anus or
mouth respectively) being formed later by secondary                     invagination.
The natural result of this acceleration is that, whilst the arehen-
teron is  only just sufficiently differentiated to give off its coeloniic
diverticula at the distal or aboral end,              its main axis has already
become     parallel   to the    bilateral    axis and the proximal              end   is
already formed into the mouth or anus.                  If  the former takes place,

then the coelomic       pouches  will   arise from the posterior end of the
gut as   two diverticula, which will move forwards in the horizontal
plane, and will give rise to paired rudiments of the protocoele, then
the paired niesocoeles,      and, finally, the metacoele (fig. 18).             On the
other hand,      if the latter    takes   place,    i.e., the blastopore      becomes
precociously    the anus alone, then the mesoderm                 will arise from the
distal extremity       as before as paired diverticula,             which will move
 backwards and       will  give  rise distally     to paired metacceles, paired
mesocoeles,    and, lastly, an unpaired protocoelo (fig. 17).
    The   former method of archiccele            formation is apparently pur
 sued  in the C/ivtognatha and the Mollmca (ralella),* and the latter
 in a great number of the Echinodermata.

loses all connection      with    the epiblast, then         it will not     be affected
by the distorted sequence of events, and will give rise to the                      arclii-
cceles  in the primitive     manner as separate            diverticula.       The    same
result will occur     if the blastopore forms neither mouth                   nor anus,
and in each of these cases there is apparently no essential                        reason
why the archicceles should not arise in quite                   as  typical   a manner
as  in the phyletic ontogeny, in which the blastopore becomes                         both
mouth and anus.
   The facts again agree with this deduction, for in BaJarw'jlotiut,

 Thus in these,            in   accordance           with the law stated above, the archi-
 cceles      arise from the distal (front) end of the arehenteron, and give
rise      backwards             to metacoeles,             niesocceles,      and protoccele.               The
main        irregularity         consists      in the fact that           the right rnesoecele (right
hydrocoele) may be                     absent        or vestigial,         whilst      there arc in the
various groups variations with respect to the relative time of division
 of,   e.g.,     the metaccele into its two portions, and of the metaccele
from the other                 archicoeles,         and,     in addition,      the formation            of the
protocoele           has not been         so   clearly followed in some                 as    in others.
   It       is   usual for       a    pair of vaso-peritoneal vesicles                   to bu formed,
which each divides up into mesocoele (hydrocele)                                         and nietaccelo
(enteroccele).*
     In Synapta            t    the metaccele          is    at first unpaired, and only later
divides into two, but, in addition, the assumption                                   by the arehenteron
of     the secondary axis on the one hand, and the formation                                            of the
protocoele           pore on the other hand, are both                        so accelerated          that the
arehenteron at one time appears to have two apertures to the exterior,
the    future anus, and the water-pore.
  It        can scarcely be maintained                      that the hydrocoeles               and entero-
cueles         of    the    Echinodermata                   are    not    respectively         homologous
throughout            the group, and their variations                       in development              appear
to be       inexplicable          except       as    modifications of            a   primitive type of
archicoile development, such as suggested here.
     The archimeric segmentation                            may, therefore, be described                 in its
ontogenetic            characters as consisting primarily                        of four archicteles,
sometimes secondarily divided                          into five or six, which                 ari.so    prim
itively as four archenteric diverticula, but which may by                                         a     simple
modification           arise     as   a   pair of diverticula, which later divide up
into the archicceles themselves.

       In certain       pelagic       larvae, e.g.    Bipinnaria,         the functional       crsophagus   is
early formed although not actually part of the                           blastopore.     In   these the two
lateral colonies        move forwards later to form the protoccele.

                                 The Larval Forms.
     One outstanding feature about the Archi-ccelomata is the con
stant occurrence        of free pelagic larval forms, and the comparison of
the demersal       larva of Balanoglossus Kowalevski with a Tornaria,
and    a  Bipinnaria or Brachiolaria with the                demersal    type of larva,
such     as that of Asterina        gibbosa, enables         one to conjecture to a
large    extent what are the secondary or ccenogenetic                      features of
these     pelagic   larvae.    We    have     assumed       that the archi-coelomate
ancestor      was pelagic in its habits, and            with this fact in view the
pelagic habits of so great a number of larvae in the Archi-cailomata
acquire     a  phyletic significance.       In other words, the vast majority of
the Archi-ccelomata pass through                a pelagic stage in their ontogeny,
because their common ancestor               was pelagic.       Amongst these larvae
 there    are   endless    instances of the archimeric segmentation into
 three    parts,   protomere, mesomere,           and metamere,        whether exem
 plified by actual division          of the body into three parts by con
 strictions,    as in Actinot rocha (fig. 7), larval Balanoglossus (fig. 8),
 the larval      of the Brachiopoda           (figs.  9, 10,    11,  12),   or whether
indicated by the structure of the three ciliated bands, prototroch,
 mesotroch,      and metatroch,     as in Tornaria, Echinoderm larvae, Actino-
 t rocha,   and Polyzoan larvae.
     This constant occurrence of archimeric               segmentation,      in however
 modified a manner it appears,                must indicate       a common        descent
 from    a form with this archimeric segmentation fully developed.
     (0.) Evidence maybe derived            f rom morphology and         from ontogeny
 of   the metamcricaJly segmented groups that a secondary                      segmenta
 tion (metameric)        has been phyletically       superposed upon tlie        primary
 (archimeric).        Thus,   these  animals may         be shcncn     to pass through
 ontogenetic stages which closely resemble the arclii-ccelomate                 type,  and
 to possess in their morphology more or less vestigial traces                       of  the
 archimeric segments.
     More than two years ago           I  remarked *      : — "I believe that these
 resemblances       will all eventually find expression in the constitution
 of one primitive         group   ....       having the mesoderm             divided     up
 into one pre-oral and two pos-toral coelomic pouches, all, primitively,

of nephro-gonaducts.                              From this type,         by segmentation
of    the trunk        or third segment, are            derived    the        Annelida and
Cfiordata."
     Later on*        these views were       given in detail, and the groups                 of
Archi-chorda           and Eu-chorda       were       shown to differ, among              other
features, in the fact that, in the latter, the third segment or trunk
became secondarily bilaterally segmented, and that the other archi
meric     segments       became      reduced      by a migration          forwards of the
newly formed metameric segments.      The justification for this view
lay in the presence of a pre-oral archenteric pouch in Amphioxus
larva, which early divides into two, and which has been compared
by many writers          to the proboscis-cavity of Balanoglossus, the rest
of the    mesoderm        being formed by a series of somites                     arising from
the posterior         end of the archenteron.
   The main difficulty in the comparison lay in the absence of
collar-cavities in Amphioxus, or its larva. This difficulty has now
been     removed by the discovery in this form of                         a   pair of arch-
enteric pouches which have been identified with the collar-cavities
of Balanoglossus.^           The author remarks — "The whole process of
mesoderm formation            is,   therefore, referable to the type formed in
Balanoglossus, the main difference being that the pouch correspond
ing to the trunk coelome of Balanoglossus becomes segmented," and
his work        is,
             therefore,  direct confirmation of the views to some
                              a
extent put forward by Morgan, and later, but independently, by
myself.
     Professor Macbride's work will undoubtedly give strong support
to    "the theory of        the descent        of the Vertebrates             from    a   form
somewhat like Balanoglossus"             ;   but, from the views expressed else
where, I        look to Actinotroclta        as   a   proximate morphological pre
sentment of the          " form     somewhat       like Balanoglossus
                                                                              "

Tornaria.
     The archimeric segments            persist in the adult       as the         head-cavity,
and    the pre-oral pit, representing                 the   protoccole,       and the first
myotome and metapleural cavities, which are the mesocceles (see
figs. 19 and 20).

 externally, but in Amphiozus          they have become       no longer defin
 able,   except in their mesodermic elements.
    Owing probably to the fact that Amphioxus has degenerated                  to
a   considerable     extent, especially in the nervous system,          one can
find more traces of the archimeric segmentation in the Holochorda or
 Vertebrata.       Here the neural tube, very typically and very early,
shows a segmentation into three primary vesicles,             the explanation
of  which has been obscure.        In  the light of the theory here put for
ward, the fore-brain corresponds         to the protomere,     and is evolved
from the protomeric ectoderm.          Such being the case, it is not surpris
ing to find that its actual wall gives rise to sense-organs (olfactory and
optic), the protomere of the Archi-ccelomata being typically sensory.
   Again, the mid-brain         corresponds to the mesomoric           or collar
nervous ganglion,      with its two   nerves  (III. and  IV. cranial), supply
ing,   respectively, the protoccele      (pro-mandibular     somite)   and the
mesoccele     (mandibular somite), just as nerves direct from the
collar-ganglion or archimeric central nervous system supply the
protocrjole   and mesoccelo in Adinotroclta        or Balanoglosgus (muscles
of proboscis     and post-oral ring).
   Posterior     to this is the elongated nervous tubo          or neurochord
with its   front   end forming the     hind-brain.    This corresponds with
the  greatly specialised dorsal ectoderm of the metamere,            a  subordi
nate   part of the body in Archi-chorda supplied with simple chords,
but forming        almost the whole of the body in the Eu-chorda.
These relationships        are even  better brought out by        a comparison
of other    organs in Aciinotrocha and in the lowest Eu-chorda.             This
comparison      is justified, because    Cephalodiscus,    Phorcmis, Balano-
glossus,    Timicata,    and Amphioxus       all have    either sedentary or
burrowing habits, and just to the extent that they are adapted for
these   habits do they differ in structure from the archi-vertebrate,
which, at least for the greater       part of its history, must have been
pelagic from Actinotroclia       onwards.
   This cannot be further followed out here, but enough has been
written to show that there is good          evidence   for believing that the
Eu-chorda have been derived from the Arrhi-rlwrda by secondary
segmentation       of the third archimeric segment          or metamere      and
gradual atrophy of the protomere and mesomere,              as closed   ca'lomic
 pouches, though their walls persist as muscles.

   In  the other groups of segmented              animals, namely, the Annelida

 cirri) which    recall to mind the post-oral tentacles                  of the    Arehi-
 ccelvmata.     This   is especially the case          in certain of the sedentary
 or tubicolous     forms, such as Magelona.                   In  the   Archi-anndida

the     peristomium             is   simple,          but     well-defined        and    prominent
(fig- 22, 2).
   Thus, morphologically,                   the    peristomium differs markedly from
the hind-segments, and ontogeny shows a still greater                                    difference.
This 'segment'              I   would homologise with the                     mesomere           of the
Archi-cwlomata,             whilst all the segments                 posterior to it are second
arily formed from               a bilateral segmentation of the metamere                         or last
segment (fig. 22, S).
   In the young of Nerine                       and other species, the peristomium is
found     to bear          long bristle-like               provisional   setae,   which     are also
found in adult fossil forms.                      The suggestion          has been made that
they    are survivals of organs belonging to an unsegmented                                ancestral

and. they may then be at once compared with the mesomeric                                          setae
of the Brachiopod larvae. On this view, the three segments of the
latter are morphologically equivalent to the prostomium, peri
stomium, and the rest of the body of the Annelid.                                  Thus, both the
Brachiopoda and Clmtognatha,                               as also Balanogloums,         may,      in    a

sense, bo described as                     worms            with three     segments       only, but
these three are not equivalent to the first three of the Annelid.
"We must rather regard the Annelid as consisting of three archi
meric     segments,          in which           the    third is hypcrtrophied              and seg
mented.
   In     the    ontogeny of the most primitive                          Annelida       (e.g.,    Poly-
gordius), the larval trochosphere has a pre-oral,                             a   post-oral, and a
peri-anal       band of cilia, which we may regard as the prototroch,
mesotroch, and metatroch respectively.
   The first two have nerve-rings in connection with them, and the
post-oral nerve-ring apparently forms the peri-cesophageal                                   ring of
the adult       (fig. 15).
   The trochosphere is thus to a large extent divided                                      into one
pre-oral segment, the pre-oral lobe, and two post-oral (fig.                                     15,    I.,
II., III.).
   Internally,        the cavities of the first two appear to be continuous,
because         the mesoderm               in   these        segments    is   in the monocytic
(mesenchymatous)                 condition.           It    is   only later that the definite

Pileolaria, which evidently belongs
to the mesomere,          and   through the
 peculiar prostomial organs found in
so   many species (fig. 23).
    As regards the nervous system of
 the   Annelida, it is evident that the           TST-

 the Euchorda,       the supra-cesophageal
 ganglion     is the only part of the annelid              nervous system      which
 is represented      in that of the Eu-c7iorda.
     In  the higher Annelida,         the   Arthropoda,      and the Eu-cltorda,
 there is the same tendency            to a   reduction of the first two archi
  meric segments,       and a gradual migration forwards of the meta-
  meric   segments,     and at the       same    time these      tend to become
  grouped into regions        in which the       segments     themselves become
  more or less unrecognisable.            Thus, the archimeric, or primitive
  pre-oral,   head disappears      altogether, and its place is taken by              a
  metameric      secondary head, and in the same way the archimeric
  thorax    or mesomere      becomes     replaced by a metameric thorax.
     It will  thus be seen that      if the trochophore        be held to be the
  larvalised    representative     of the archi-ccelomate         type, then       the
  Rotifera, Entoprocta,        and some smaller groups,          such   as Echino-
  deret, can   claim to be placed in the Archi-ccelomata, and the same

applies to some at least of the Sipunculids,              though more know
ledge is required with regard to the origin and arrangement of the
coelome    in  these types.*
    These groups are all placed with those which have been above
referred to as one group, Vermidea, quite recently by Professor
Delage,t and it would be superfluous to add here his arguments for
this grouping.        For  the present,    I would  not weaken the argument
by definitely claiming to be included in the Archi-ccelomata, other
than the groups previously dealt with, as showing direct indications
of an archimerically         segmented     mesoderm,    with the other primi
tive characters cited.
     We now have       to inquire what bearing the above facts can have
upon classification.
     The Platyhelminth.es, Nemertea,          and Nemathdminthes,          all are
groups or phyla of the Triploblastica,             which show more or less a
 monocytic condition of the mesoderm,            and there is at present         no
 evidence    for regarding them as having degenerated           from ccelomate
forms.      The body-cavity        of the Nematoda        approaches     in some
 respects    a   coelome,   but more      evidence is required.          For con
 venience sake, they may be placed together as Pseudo-caela.                   The
 rest   of the     Triploblastica     give evidence of either being archi
 merically     segmented     or of having     passed   through an archimeric
 stage.
     Those which remain with the primitive characters            narrated above
 may be included         in  one group, the Archi-ccdomata,        which would
 comprise the Echinodermata, Archi-chorda,              Chcetognatha,    Brachio-
poda, Ectoproda, and possibly the Endoprocta and Rotifera. From
 forms allied to the Archi-chorda, the Eu-dwrda have been further
 differentiated by metameric segmentation and further elaboration
 of structure, whilst from forms allied possibly to the Chatognatha
 and Brachiopoda          have arisen the Annelida        and Arthropoda,       the
 further elaboration of structure in this case also involving                meta
 meric segmentation.          Apart from this feature,      the  Archi-anneluia

These have not become metamerically segmented                ;  they retain the

almost every other feature of the Archi-coelomata,                 so that they
must    be   regarded   as    having   progressed     above    this group, but
without    the aid of metameric        segmentation.      If   the presence    of
archimeric segmentation        without the metameric     be the sole criterion,

courtesy   of Professor Schinskewitsch,         had my attention called to     a
paper read by him before the International             Congress   at Moscow in
1892,    Sur  les Relations    genetiques    de   quelque   gronpes   des  Mela-
zoaires.    In   this he attempts to bring together very much the
same groups as     I  have done above, and in a similar manner he lays
emphasis upon the divisions of the coclome.              He, however, derives
them from     a common     ancestor,  the Enterocwlula        with one pair of
" sacs coelomiques,"     and regards    the subsequent       divisions into two
(Tentaculiger),      and later into three,       as secondary,     whereas   the
essential part of the above theory is that the divisions are primary
and comprise      a form of segmentation which            the Metazoa owe to
their descent from axially (radially) symmetrical animals.                I have
been able to add a number of morphological and ontogenetic facts
which have become known since            1 892,  and feel justified in leaving
the term Archi-Ccelomata as emphasising the views here expressed
of archimeric and metameric        segmentation.

On a supposed Resemblance between the Marine Faunas
      of the Arctic and Antarctic Regions. By D'Arcy
      Wentworth Thompson, C.B.
                            (Read May   2,  1898.)
   The view that a peculiar likeness exists between the northern
and southern extra-tropical faunas, and particularly          between   those
of the Arctic and Antarctic        regions,   was suggested     by ThtSel in
discussing the remarkable deep-sea group of the Elasipoda,             whose
discovery we owe to the Challenger             Expedition.      A somewhat
similar view is hinted at or referred to more than once in other
Reports of the same Expedition.            It was afterwards stated    in an
ampler way by Pfeffer       ( Versuch   iiber die Erdgeschichtliclie     Ent-
urickelung    der jetzigen Verbreitungsverhaltnisse unserer Thiei~welt,
1891), and has of late        been   dealt with in great      detail, and in
relation to the antecedent causes that might have             led to such   a
phenomenon, by Sir       John Murray.        On the other hand,      Dr Ort-
mann, considering the hypothesis from the point of view of our
knowledge of the distribution of Crustacea, has rejected it entirely
("Uber Bipolaritat in derVerbreitung mariner Thiere," Zool. Jalirb.,
1896;     cf.  also "Marine     Organismen      und  ihre   Existenzbeding-
ungen," ib., 1897), and     Dr Chun, dealing with        the pelagic   fauna
("Die Beziehungen zwischen           clem arktischen    und antarktischen
Plankton," Stuttgart,     1897),  while showing how in truth a certain
small number of forms are common to far northern and far southern
seas, holds that the facts are sufficiently accounted        for by the con
tinuous distribution or. gradual intermixture of forms in the depths
of the intervening      oceans   under present     conditions, without our
needing to have recourse        to an explanation      of the phenomenon
in the different conditions of      a former age.
   The    mere circumstance that so simple an issue should be open to
question as the correspondence         between the Arctic and Antarctic
faunas on the whole, and the existence         or non-existence of a largo
proportion of actually identical species in the two, is in itself clear

or indeed from any other relation that could be clearly                                    demon
strated    between        the       polar faunse and specific              lines or. areas          of
distribution       in   the other oceans, exemplify on the zoological                             side
the magnitude of the general                    problems that deep-sea exploration
has yet to solve.
     But we are impatient to know, and we are tempted,                             even in the
absence of definite or adequate                 knowledge, to discuss, how far                    this
Antarctic       faunse       extends into           other    seas,   to   what degree it             is
kindred to the marine fauna of the north, how temperature,                                  ocean-
current, or other causes may distribute or circumscribe                                    it,    and
whether existing phenomena                    are adequate, or past conditions of the
globe     are necessary,          to account        for the facts we find.            I,   for     my
part, hold with Ortmann, that an actual community of forms                                  is     not
proven,     save for      a      very few forms, some peculiar to the extreme
depths of the       sea, and others           that inhabit the surface of the               ocean
in colder latitudes while                 represented        in the deeper         and      colder
waters of tropical           seas   ;   and
                                          I     hold with Chun that the necessity
has not been shown for invoking, in explanation of such community
and intermixture of forms as actually exists, the hypothesis of                                      a
remote     community of origin                  under       different     conditions in pre-
tertiary times.
     Sir John Murray              has given in his paper,             "On     the Deep and
Shallow "Water Marine Fauna of the Kerguelen Region of the great
                         "

identical from northern and southern waters, though absent from
tropical   seas.        Had we anything like so great                a    list to deal with of
well-marked and unmistakably identical forms, the                              case   would         be
indeed     a   remarkable one.                But    though      Sir John Murray                  has
shown that the forms tabulated in his list were sometimes recorded
not as identical but as distinct varieties,                  and that in other        cases        the
identification was admittedly dubious,                 I     do not       think that       ha has
at all   fully allowed for          the extent to which the basis of his theory
is   weakened       by the          aggregate       of dubiety       in    these   and other
individual     cases.    I       think that     we should be very reluctant indeed

  have   frankly acknowledged, or from minute species in polymorphic
  groups, where species          are distinguished        by minute characters and
  very often    by characters       drawn only from           a shell without examina
  tion   of  the    animal      itself.      Of the forms which               remain after
  deduction     of such       as these,     it  seems    to me very important                 to
  discriminate between those whose affinities appertain to the fauna
  of the    North Pacific          and of the        North Atlantic respectively.
  For   the fauna         of the North          Pacific    presents      many unknown
  problems    to us     ; but this we do know, that it contains in part                        a
 northern circumpolar             fauna, and in         part     a   fauna very distinct
 from that       of the North Atlantic and peculiarly                       linked      to the
 fauna    of the      Southern       Ocean.       And     we know         a  little,   though
 not much,      of the manner in which this continuity is established,
 along    the western         shores    of the American             continent, in waters
 singularly    cold for the latitudes under which they lie.                         There are
 not a   few forms that seem to come into the same category                              as  the
 genus    Seroli<,     the penguins, the          sea- elephant, the          sea-lions,     and
 the fur-seals    — I might add          the giant sea-weed            Macrocy4U — that,
 from a circumpolar             habitat in the Antarctic, seem to creep up to
 varying     distances far along           the "Western         American coast, to the
 Galapagos,       to    California,     or even      to   the      northern      islands and
Japan.       The work of American naturalists, and, in particular, the
explorations        of the "Albatross," have of late years added very
largely     to our knowledge            of this area of distribution.
     In this paper I          have    attempted firstly to weigh the evidence
for the particular           cases   that Murray has quoted                as examples of
¦species    represented in both northern                 and      southern      seas,   though
absent    from the intervening tropical areas               :  and   I think    that the evi
dence     so weighed persuades            us to recognise       that many,       if not   most,
of those     alleged cases of identity were extremely dubious,                         even    in
the eyes     of those who first described them, while others, in regard to
which the describers expressed               no doubt, seem dubious at least to me,
by reason      of the insignificant          size or comparative poverty in well-
marked discriminative characters                of the organisms themselves.                 We
know much more than wo did when the Cliallenger Reports were
written of the difficulty attending the identification of such forms
for instance         as   the Ostracods         or the Polyzoa,          two      groups     that

figure largely in     Dr Murray's list.     And if we   needed (as we prob
ably     did   need)   another object-lesson to teach       us the danger     of
identifying and classifying species from inadequate material, or from
inspection of external characters alone, we have lately been taught
that lesson in a very forcible way by Mr Moore's research on the
Molluscs      of Lake Tanganyika; where he has shown that many
Molluscs which had before been identified by their shells alone, and
had, on such evidence, been ascribed to lacustrine types, come, in
 the   light of anatomical study, to yield the clearest evidence of
 affinities and of sources unsuspected before.
     The   facts   here   brought    together also   show,     chiefly  on   the
 authority of American naturalists and of the explorers of the Bay
 of Bengal, that in several cases the          known     range    of particular
 species or genera has been of late extended, so that          in  some groups
 of which before we knew only northern and southern representa
 tives,   we now       discern something     more    of   their   cosmopolitan
 extension across the depths of the tropical           sea.
     I have also sought to show, but very briefly, how, in the cases
 that are left to us, we have apparently to deal with facts for which
  one general    explanation will not suffice, but which        deserve   to be
  examined and if possible explained one by one according to the
  special characters or circumstances of each.
      Lastly, leaving aside the examples chosen by Sir        John Murray, I
  have tried to bring together what we know regarding the             Antarctic
  fauna in certain groups, especially the Fishes and the Crustacea,
  groups in regard to which our knowledge is of considerable extent,
  and in which specific characters are comparatively plain and unmis
  takable.     In  these groups   I can find no trace of evidence in support

knowledge of this species                      is   scanty,        and that the fragments which
are     assigned to         it,   both from the Southern Ocean                                  and from the
West Indian, were in both cases only conjecturally                                                assigned      to
the same species              as    the    more          typical fragment from the neigh
bourhood           of the Kermadecs.                     As   regards the generic                 distribution
of this form, we have well-marked                                  and     well-known            species from
Japan, while fragments are assigned                                 to the same genus (Schultze,
i.e.,  327) from the Gulf of Mexico, the Island of St Thomas,
        p.
and from the coast of Portugal. Such    distribution has various         a
parallels      among other Hexactinellids.

we know nothing of the gonosome,                          and therefore the reference                of
this species to the genus Campanidaria is merely provisional.                                         A

specimen         recorded from 1950 fathoms, lat. 53° 55' S., long. 108°

northern         specimens         were     so preserved       as to be,   according to the
describer,       "of
                 very little practical use" (Report, p. 77). Under
these circumstances, and bearing in mind the extreme difficulty of
specific     identification          of sea-anemones           when preserved,              however
well preserved             they may be, we              may here again,          I   think,       hesi
tate    to     accept      the      evidence        before us; while, in so far as we
may accept         it,   it   would merely serve to extend the distribution                           of
these two Actiniae             to the extreme           south of the Japanese region.

 definition    of the genus]    ; it is most probable that this form is a
 distinct species from    L. Wyirille-thomsoni, and this         seems    still more
likely    on considering     the nature of the sea bottom             (sandy mud
instead of globigerina-ooze) and the comparatively inconsiderable
 depth at which the animal was found living."                  The other species

The two small specimens                    were immature, and " their characters
too undefined for satisfactory description"                         (Trans. Roy. Soc., 1874

   Sir Wyville Thomson (I.e.) speaks of this " singular little urchin
to which       I
           have given provisionally the name Pourtaletia phyale."
The single specimen                collected by the "Challenger" measured only
18 mm.       long; it came from 1975 fathoms in lat. 62° 26' S., long.
95°    44'    E. The original description by Wyville Thomson is ex
ceedingly brief, and is accompanied by no structural figures.                                           The
genua    is one of the most remarkable of the Spatangoid Eohinoidea,
with peculiarly interesting affinities to certain fossil forms.                                         The
type     species,       P. rimanda, was described by Agassiz from 349
fathoms       off   the Tortugas, while other species                    are known, all from
deep or very deep water, in various parts of the                                   world     :   one, for
instance,     P.    rosea, in the equatorial Pacific                ;   another, P. la<junrula,
from     the North, South, and equatorial Pacific;                                 P. htipida,           P.
erratopyga, and            P. earinata, all from the Southern                        Ocean in from
34' to 62° south latitude.                 In    regard to Wyville Thomson's speci
mens no information                 is given as to their size, but he apparently
leaves      it to   be understood that his figure,                  which          measures           nearly
two inches long, is of natural size.                   This     is in sharp contrast to the
dimensions          of the "Challenger"                    specimen       from       the         Southern
Ocean, and, together               with    the   inadequacy of the original descrip
tion, seems          to     render the specific             identity     of the         two a very
doubtful       matter.        The genus, however, is manifestly ancient, and
is,   in fact,      a   typical example of             a   form that         is    at once ancient,
abyssal,      and widely           distributed     through northern, equatorial, and
southern latitudes.

  approach even more nearly that of                 P. mimicus from the North
 Australian      sea are      very striking,     and, at the same time, highly
 suggestive     of the genetic connection of the three forms."               P. mimi

     Dytaster      exilis, Sladen. — This asteroid belongs to               a    widely-
 distributed genus, all whose species come from deep water {in one
 case only from so little as 800 fathoms) from the North and South
 Atlantic, North and South Pacific, and the Eastern Archipelago.
 In regard      to the species        cited, the type came' from 1375 fathoms
 between Valparaiso             and Juan     Fernandez.       A    form was got in
  1900 fathoms off Tristan d'Acunha, in regard to the single example
 of which the describer says (Etp., p. 68) : — " Tliis                   I propose to
 rank provisionally as a variety of this form, although it may after
 wards be found to merit recognition as a distinct species " ; while,
 lastly,    specimens       were    taken    in    1700   fathoms      in  the    North
 Atlantic, off Maryland,           which are described as         a variety consider
 ably nearer than the other to the type-species.                     "We have to do,
 in short, with a very widely distributed form, very variable, or
 rather comprising forms only provisionally linked together                    ;  while,
even     if  wo   still   do   link  them,   the range      of distribution       is not

 Melbourne,        and from 2900 fathoms, lat. 35° 22' N., long. 169° 53'
 E.,  between       Japan and the Sandwich Islands.                   It   is a very tiny
 species,     with    a disc about 3 mm.            across,  and a spread        of about
 5 cm.      It  is the only Comatula described in the Cliallenger Reports
from     a   depth greater than 2000 fathoms.                     One specimen was
 obtained      from the northern, and two from the southern locality.
An     inspection of the figures (pi. xxxiii. figs.               1  and 2) suggests a
grave doubt as to the precise identity of the two species ; the basal
plates, in particular, are shown to be much broader in shape in the
northern example.              But if   the two be accepted          as identical,    I see
nothing very remarkable in              the presence of the same abyssal              form
at two stations in             the  region of the Western              Pacific,    off the

    A   closely allied species, A. alternata, P.                     H. C,     is described from
a   chain of localities — north-east of New Zealand, north of Papua,
near the Kermadecs, and south of Japan.                                 Several other species
range from Queensland or Torres Strait to Japan, or to the                                       China
Sea, e.g., A. Coppingeri,           Bell   ;    A. midtiradiata,          L.    ;    A. variipinna,
Carpenter.          Some of the older or better known species have a very
wide distribution,           especially in longitude, e.g., A. tenella, from the
Kara     Sea to the coasts of Portugal                    and New England, or Aciino-
metra pulchella,             Pourt.,    from         the        Caribbean           Sea,     St Paul's
Rocks,      and the European               coast     ;     while     in certain other                cases,
e.g.,   A. carinata, Carpenter, we                  have      an alleged distribution                 of a
very extraordinary,            circum-tropical             kind,     including        Brazil, Vene
zuela,    Chili, Ceylon, Seychelles, Zanzibar, Madagascar, the Red
Sea, and          St Helena.       "We must remember                    also        that the genus
Antedon contains somewhere                     about 50 species, and is cosmopolitan
in its   range.
     Drepariophoru8 serraticoUis, Hubrecht.                        — In regard to the                   col
lection     of      Challenger      Nemertines,               Dr Hubrecht,             in reporting
upon      it,   calls attention to the extreme care with which the broken
fragments of these fragile animals had been preserved,                                     and to their
excellent state for purposes of microscopical examination, although
"it     looked far from promising from                    a   systematist's point of view,"
colour and outward                form being alike lost.                 The two specimens,
both broken,  assigned to D. serraticoUis (which         common                      is    a
Mediterranean species), came from shallow water in Bass's Straits.
In    so assigning them, Professor Hubrecht                          writes as follows           :— "It
needs     no comment,           that   it      is   at the least         rather hazardous to
identify        with    a   Mediterranean           species      a   specimen         in which the
proboscis as well as its armature                        is   absent.     Still tho transverse
sections        offer such    a   very close resemblance                  to    those          of actual
specimens         of D. serraticoUis that                it   would be again hazardous to
establish       a   new species for the fragments."                   ....          "I     have, more
over, hazarded the identification                   with the foregoing specimens                       of     a
third fragment collected in the Kerguelen                               waters, of which not
only the proboscis            but also the head was absent.                           Here, too, the

internal characters enabled me to refer the specimen               to the genua
Drepanophorus         (the transverse   cceca   of the proboscidean sheath
being in this case the guiding feature).          The systematic position of
this specimen thus only rests upon the similarity of the transverse
sections and on the general yellow hue of the fragment, darker on
the    dorsal than on the ventral         surface" (Rep.,      p.   18).      While
such evidence was no doubt reasonably valid as grounds                   for treat
ing together the several fragments of the worm,             I  cannot imagine
that    it will really   be relied upon as evidence       of specific identity
between      the nemertine faunas of the northern and southern               seas.

might be necessary) in D. (Oerebratulus) cratxus of Quatrefages,
adduces from various authorities, as localities for the species, not
only many European stations, but also Madeira, Mauritius,                     Samoa
and     Panama,      and states that it "liisst wahrscheinlich              nur die

     PeJagonemertes Rollestoni,        Moseloy.   — This very remarkable,
transparent pelagic nemertine was              taken by the " Challenger "
"near the southern         verge of the South Australian      current," lat. 50°
 1' S.,   long. 123° 4' E., and was again recorded in the mouth of
 Yokohama Bay.           It  seems to be closely allied     to the Ptervaoma
plana of Lesson, obtained in great abundance between                       the  Mo
 luccas and     New Guinea during      the voyage of the     "Coquille."
     In  the more recent monograph of the group by Burger               (F. and F.
 d. Golfes     v. Neapel,    Nemortinen,    p. 596) attention        is   called to
 very marked differences,        both external and internal, between              the
 specimens       of Pelagonemertes from the northern              and     southern
 localities,  and that writer, without hesitation, erects the two forms
 into separate species, retaining the name         P. Rollestoni, Moseley, for
  the Australian     form, and giving the new name        P. Moseleyi        to that
  from Japan.       Burger points out    as diagnostic characters       that in
  Moseleyi the body is about as long as broad, is constricted in front,
  behind, and     in the middle, and that     the gut possesses five pairs of
  diverticula   ;  whereas in   P. Rollestoni   the body is twice        as  long   as
  broad, is constricted neither      before nor behind, and the gut has
  thirteen    pairs of diverticula.       He points out further that              the
  smaller    form    (from    Yokohama)     which    had   been     assumed        by

waters."      M'lntosh (Chall. Rep., " Annelida,"           p. 477) points     out
various differences between the northern and southern species, and
cites   Kinberg as an authority for the occurrence of the latter also
at  Kio de Janeiro.
    Eunice     Oerstedi,   Stimpson.     — Of this     species,   to which      Dr
M'lntosh      assigns   a mark of      interrogation    in identifying    it with
Stimpson's original description, a single specimen              is said to have
been taken by the        "Challenger" in      1240 fathoms off the coast         of
New York, another smaller one in              85 fathoms somewhat further
north off the coast of Nova Scotia, while several small specimens
about 90 mm. in length are recorded from 69 fathoms off Marion
Island.      M'lntosh calls attention (Rep.,         p. 273 et seq.) to several
 minor differences       between these latter and the former examples.
 He   states  that " in the foreign (southern) example, the branchia of
 the   10th foot has two divisions, that of the 20th four, the 30th
 four, and the 40th none," and adds,            " this Eunice    seems to come
 near the E. Oerstedi        of Stimpson, the chief difference being the
 number of divisions in the branchiae, which Stimpson states is five."
 He further calls attention to       the close resemblance       of the form to
 E. norvegicu (L.) and also to E. macrochata, Schmarda, from the
 southern shores of Jamaica.

 rests   upon

    Odracoda.     — Eight     species   of Ostracoda are enumerated             in Dr
Murray's list on the strength of the Challenger collections.                         In
                               Krithe tumida, Brady                 " Ostracoda,"
regard to two of these,                                   {Rep.,                       p.
115), and Xedoleberis           expanna, Brady (p. 129),         I  cannot discover
any reference        to their occurrence in the north.           In  regard to most
of the others,        considerable dubiety is expressed            by Dr Brady in
regard to their         identity; for    example,   in reference       to Paradoxo-
ttoma     abbreviation, G. 0. Sars (op. cit., p. 150), he says,               "As    no
very decided characters          appear, and as no sufficient series of speci
mens of the Kerguelen            form is at hand for comparison,             it seems
 best to   identify     them, for the present at least,         with   the European
 species."      Cythere siihmi, Brady, and Sclerochiliis             contortu.%   Nor
 man, were represented          in their southern localities only by imperfect
 specimens or separated          valves.    Xestoleberin       depres»a, G.   0.  Sars,
 is  a  northern species recorded by Brady from Kerguelen, with the
 remark,
             " it  is to be borne in mind, however, that the distinctions
 between this and the           next species   (X.   SKligera, Brady, from         Ker
 guelen, Heard Island, etc.)          if valid at all, are very slight, and         it  is
 not unlikely that the two may prove to             be   identical."
     Furthermore, it behoves us to remember                 that the study of the
 Ostracods is now conducted in a totally different way, and stands

 monograph was prepared.              The Challenger        species were identified

    Calanus finmarcliicug,         Gunner. — This abundant northern             form
is said to have been taken in the surface net in lat. 35" 9' S., long.
45° 30' E.       Also reported by Brady              (Chall.  Rep., Copepoda,        p.
32),   from off Cape         Howe, Australia.          After calling attention to
certain apparent differences,            Dr Brady says, " the only reasonable
course is to consider both the northern               and the southern forms        as
belonging to one species, probably                the most abundant       and most
widely distributed of all            the   Copepoda."       The genus,    of which
Giesbrecht      enumerates        fourteen species (F. and F. d. Gol/es              r.
Neapel, Pelagische Copepoden, p. 89), is cosmopolitan.                      Calanus
valgus,    Brady,    which Giesbrecht assigns to             C. minor,    Claus, C.
gracilis,   Dana, and         C. propinquus, Brady, are instances of other
species whose extended distribution              ranges north and south of and
between the tropics.              It  is   C.  propinquus      that  at Kerguelen
replaces     C. finmarchicus         in   the same abundance         as  the latter
occurs    in Arctic      seas.
   Harpiictims /ulcus,          Fischer.   — Kecorded       by Brady from      pools
above high-water mark at Kerguelen                   (Phil. Tram.,    168, p. 215).
This    species, which occurs in similar localities in Europe,               is also
stated by Brady to have            been got    in  35 fathoms off the Yorkshire
 coast (Monogr.      Brit.     Cojwpods,    vol. ii. p. 151).     The latter   speci
mens had been formerly described as //. rrassieornis (B. A.                    Sep.,
 1875, p. 19G).
   Scalpellum velutinum, Hock.             — In regard to this species PrHoek
(Chall.    Hep., Cirripeds,        p.   96) says, "This beautiful species is
represented by        a   single specimen        (from 1425 fathoms north of
Tristan d'Acunha).             Provisionally there must be referred to the
same species     three smaller specimens            which were dredged near        the
southern point of Portugal             ;  yet  I  am not quite sure that they
belong really to the same species.               This  species is nearly related     to
S. regium, S.    Dancinii,       S. gigas, S. rohusium, etc.," and this group,
like  the genus as a whole, covers an immense                range of distribution.

 fathoms off Kerguelen           and from 2050 fathoms in the middle of
 the  North Pacific.          The describer says (Chall. Rep., Isopoda, p.
 122),  "I     find it impossible to distinguish this individual (from the
 North Pacific) from those dredged                at Kerguelen     by any very dis
tinctly marked characters            ;  at the same time     the condition     of the
specimen       does not enable       me to speak with      great   certainty, which
is all the more          to be regretted,       as the   occurrence    of the same
species    in very deep and in shallow water is            a rare   occurrence."
    Neotanais        americanut, F. E. B. — A small species, of which one
specimen came from 1900 fathoms off the                  River Plate, and another
from 1240 fathoms south-east               of New York.       Beddard states that
the latter      "presents     certain slight differences      having reference      to
the  proportionate length of the thoracic segments.                     Seeing,  how
ever,  that the two specimens              come from     widely distant localities,
it appears to be unnecessary             to found a specific distinction between
the two      individuals     at least for the present."
    Eurycope fmtjilU,           F. E. B. — To this     species are referred several
specimens         from    very deep       water off Marion       Island    and   other
stations      still farther south in          the  Southern Ocean,       and one of
much       larger     size,  from      1875   fathoms, off Yokohama.            Other
species     are known from the North and Middle Atlantic, from New
Guinea,      New Zealand, and the Southern              Ocean,    while Hansen has
recently       described      {Harvard Bull., 1897, p. 100) a species, K.
•puldira, from near the Galapagos, which ho says is closely allied to
E. fray His,        Beddard.       Sars has added       a species   from the Medi
terranean        to the nine others that are         as  yet only known from the
Scandinavian coasts.
    LopliQfjrister typictis, M. Sars.        — This remarkable northern species
was twice          taken by the       " Challenger " close to the Cape of Good
Hope.
    Boreowysiii sryphopt,           Sars. — This species, known        also from tho
Arctic Sea to the north of Norway, is recorded, on tho indisputable
authority         of Sars, from great          depths in three      localities in the
Southern          Ocean     (Cfiall. ll<>p., Schizopoda, p. 182).             Another
species, B. arctiea, is very closely allied to one from the Gulf of
California,         described    by     Ortmann     as   B. cali/ornica      {Harvard
Bull., xxv.         p. 106, 1894).        Other species occur in the deep water
of the North Atlantic and North Pacific.

   Professor Sars a very little bit may be expected to yield very clear
   indications, yet we may note that the only record of this species
   from    the Southern          Hemisphere        is    based     upon     "the recently
   moulted skin of the outer part of the                     tail of another specimen
   apparently belonging to the same species.                      This skin     was brought
   up along with specimens of Boreomysis scyjrfiops                       in the Southern
   Ocean between Kerguelen and Australia."
      Glyphocramjon         rimapes, Spence Bate. — Under this species                    Mr
   Spence Bate groups          a specimen from 1875 fathoms off Yokohama,
   one from     1715     fathoms in the South Atlantic between Buenos
   Ayres and Tristan d'Acunha,                 and two from           1375    fathoms near
  Juan Fernandez.            The genus is a typical deep-sea one, and other
  species   come      from many localities in the North Atlantic, West
  Indies, Indian Ocean, and North and South Pacific.
      Lithodes Murrayi,          Henderson.      — This      species    is referred to by
   Murray    {I.e., pp. 406      and 456) as the           southern representative of
   L.  maia, to which, according to Henderson, it is apparently most
   closely allied.       Ortrnann        (Zool. Jahrb.,        1896,   p.   584)    deals   at
  length with this case, and, in part following                     Faxon      (" Albatross"
   Crust., p. 51), brings           L. Murrayi        into     closer    relation with L.
  turritus, Ortmann, from Japan, and                   L. jxmamensis, Faxon, from
  the west coast of America.
                                            " Zum mindesten geht hinaus hervor
  dass die Gruppe des L. Maia und Murrayi sowohl in Japan als

     M. Bouvier, in his recent monograph of                  the Lithodidre      (Ann. Set.
i\~at., Zool. (8), v. 1896),           likewise gives no support to the view
that   L. Maia      is the nearest       ally of L. Murrayi.           He, on the other
hand, brings into close relation with the latter, two species,                            L.

 which,      if   they are not intermediate between,                        are at least      closely
allied to the        Arctic and Antarctic          species.        The distribution of             the
Lithodidae           is,    as   M. Bouvier       remarks, extremely                  curious and
interesting, and his account merits close attention                              ;    it   gives    no
support      at all to      a    theory of bipolar distribution.
     Munidoptu Antonii, M. E. — Specimens from 1800 fathoms south
west of       Australia, and from 1375 fathoms west of Valparaiso, are

     Munidopds             mh&iuamo*a,        Henderson. — Described                   from     1875
fathoms off Yokohama.                    Two    specimens,        one from 1450             fathoms
off the west coast               of Patagonia, and the other from 1375 fathoms
between           Marion Island         and the        Crozets,        are    described      as var.
aculeafa of the same species                   (Henderson, Cliall. Rep., Anomura,
p.
     153).         A variety of striking           characters          in which the variety
differs    from the type species are pointed out by the describer,                                 and
an inspection           of his figures       reveals   a   striking difference             in aspect.
Other species of the same genus are described                               from Patagonia, the
Philippines, the West Indies, the north-east                             coast of the         United
States, etc., and another variety of the same species                            is   described     by
Alcock from 1800 fathoms in the Indian Ocean (.4. and M. N. H.
(6), xiii. p. 331, 1894). Mr Faxon (Harvard Mem., xviii. p. SG)
considers this variety to be closely allied to                         M.    crassa, Smith, from
the east coast             of the United States.
     More recent students of the group, for instance                            Bonnier ("Gala-
thtides      des cotes de France,"              Bull.    Sc. France et Behjique (3),                   i.,
1888), find         it     necessary    to describe and figure very many of the
appendages          for the identification        even of the commoner                     European
species.
  Mytilm edulis, (L.). — Recorded from Kerguelen (Phil. Trans.,

"This        common species has become widely distributed, and differs
considerably in form, colour, and size."                          In   the Kerguelen Report,
Mr Smith            says   : — " After   a   careful consideration of this species,                    I

 mussel."      Dall (Bull. U.S. Nat. Mu*.,         1876,  iiL  p. 41), with whom
 Smith diners, says, in assigning the Kerguelen                form to M. canali
 culus,    Hanley,    that "the shell of this species            closely resembles
 some varieties of      M. edulis, but the soft parts        are quite different."
 It  is plain that the allied forms or species            from Chili, New Zea
 land, etc., are very similar.
    Glomus nitens,        Jeff. — Recorded in        deep    water from various
 stations in the North Atlantic, and also from 1900 fathoms off the
 Rio    do la Plata     (E. A. Smith,     Chall. Rep., Lamellibranchiata,            p.
 248).     There are several closely-allied species of these little shells
in the West Indian region.
    Kellia suborbicularis, Mont. — A European               species found also       in
 the    Canary    Islands,   and of which        two specimens        are   recorded
 (Smith, I.e., p. 201) from Kerguelen.
                                                    " One of them exhibited           a
 very trifling difference in the hinge-plate, which was not, however,
 maintained by the second           example."      Three other minute species
are recorded from Kerguelen,             besides   others from the Australian
region,    the Straits of Magellan,         etc.
    Puncturella noachina, (L.). — This small Fissurellid is recorded in
one variety, v. princeps, Migh, from several stations near Marion
Island,     and in another, v. galeata, Gould,              from the Straits         of
Magellan.       Mr Watson      says that he has found       it  impossible    to sepa
rate    the southern form, which is unquestionably the                 P. prineep*,
from the species of Linne.           He further groups together         a number     of
species or varieties, giving to the unified form a distribution includ
ing     North Greenland,         Spitzbergen,     Sea   of Okhotsk,        Northern
Japan,      Oregon,    Straits   of Magellan,      and the Falkland Islands.
Of     the   few   other,   not    dissimilar,   species,   some     are   from    the
North Atlantic,        several   from the West Indies, and one from the
Australian region.

many similar forms, is said to be very like T. ottoi, Phil., a form
found fossil at Messina, and identified with the M. regalis, VerrilL
abundant off the New England coast.

  this  Natira with G. O. Sars' specimens from Norway, I am not
  quite satisfied,    and yet      I   cannot part them."            He recites several
  differences    between the forms, but states that " N. groenlandica
  varies  in all these respects, and the study of that species leaves the
 imprassion that the          differences     I  have   mentioned above might be
 found filled up."            It  is notorious that the identification             of the

so   doing by the opinion of Professor von Martens and of                       Mr E. A.

genus    in southern waters.
    Homalofjiira        atomu^,     (Philippi). — A single, slightly weathered
specimen       dredged by the
                                     " Challenger " in 140 fathoms off Marion
Island.       This tiny shell, whose length is only "0125 of an inch, is
widely distributed from Norway to the Mediterranean and Madeira.
Dr Watson remarks                (Rep.,    "Gasteropoda,"         p.   121)  that it   "is
extremely       abundant in Madeira, and careful                  search   will probably
supply many additional               localities for its dwelling."

  Doris tuberculoid, Cuv. — This                  species   is   recorded       in the "       Report
of the Antarctic           Expedition" (E. A. Smith, Phil. Trans., vol.
168,   p.   183).         "A Xudibranch brought from Kerguelen Island

Murray (Trans.                Roy.   Soe.    Edin., vol. xxxviii.                p.   448)       notes
that Studer doubtfully records D. tuberculata from Kerguelen,                                       but
Bergh considers             the form referred to as probably                     identical with
his Archidoris kprguchmsis,                 and distinct from the northern form.
 I     do   not know            that    any      eonchologist has ascribed import
ance   to these few and somewhat doubtful                           instances            of identity
between        northern        and southern         shells.        Mr E. A. Smith,                    in
reporting on the Mollusca of Kerguelen, while calling attention                                       to
the apparent similarity of certain species to northern forms, dwells
upon the great resemblance                  of the fauna as at present known                          to
that of the Falkland Islands and South Patagonia                            ;    while      the Rev.
A. H. Cooke (Cambr. Nat. Hist., "Mollusca," p. 367) states that
''the Mollusca of Kerguelen Island and the Marion and Crozets
groups show relationship               partly with South America, partly with
the    Capo,     and     partly      with    South Australia              and    New        Zealand,

     Diarhoris        vmgellanica,         Busk.   — This       species       is    known          from
Kerguelen,           Straits of Magellan, and the Australian                             region,    and
has been        identified       by Mr Busk with D. Buskii, Heller, from the
Adriatic      (Br y. Adriatica,           18G7, p. 93).
   Escharoidet verruculata, (Smit). — Brought by the "Challenger"
from the neighbourhood of Heard Island, and identified with
Cellepora verruculata, Smit, from the West Indies.                                 The species is

should        be assigned         to the form here described,                     with respect         to
which        all that appears to me to be certain                     is,   that the specimens,
mere        fragments, in the Challenger                   collection       are    identical with

synonymy or identity of this latter species.
    Membranipora        galeata,    Busk. — Described from Kerguelen             and
from the Falkland Islands (Busk, " Rep. Antarctic                  Exp.,"     Trans.
 Roy. Soc, vol. clxviii. p. 195).          A form described as var. multijida
is recorded both from Simon's Bay and from the Azores (Busk,
 Chall. Rep., pt. xxx. p. 64).

species was formerly known from the Mediterranean                    Sea   and    the
coast of Portugal.
    Pyrosoma spinosum,         Hcrdman. — This species is represented in
the Challenger collections by a few small fragments only, obtained
in the South Atlantic 400 miles west of Inaccessible Island,                      and
again in the .North       Atlantic    to the west of the Azores.
    In regard    to the Tunica ta as a whole, Professor            Herdruan        has
lately expressed his opinion          as follows : — " The Tunicata instanced
by Dr Murray, both in his 'Challenger                   Summary,' and in his
paper    on the    'Marine Fauna of          the Kerguelen     Region,'     help     to
swell lists that assume rather imposing dimensions                 ;   but when       I
examine the case of these species and genera of Tunicata             individually.
I  find that the      records of occurrence         have   to be     added     to   or
modified in such        a  way as to entirely change the nature of their
evidence,     and show that there is no such close                    resemblance
between the northern and southern polar faunas as                      Dr Murray

 from 1375 fathoms near          Marion Island.        The species is common in
 the deep     waters of the Atlantic, and allied species come from the
 1'liilippiues   and Japan.

 water in the middle of the         North Pacific,     again off Yokohama        Bay,
and lastly     off Marion Island.        Another    species, S. pinnatus, is .still
more     widely distributed, occurring in the North and South Atlantic,
off Japan, and south of the Philippines,              and another, S. brevidor-

from the South Pacific caught           in  lat. 42° 56' S., long. 149° 26'       W.
Dr Giinther        remarks    —"   I must not omit to mention that none of
the    authors referred to have given the number of luminous spots
along the       abdomen, and       that, not having         a  specimen    from the
Mediterranean,        I  am consequently unable to assert the agreement
of our fish in this respect.         Also that Valenciennes has counted 72
scales    along the side of the body, whilst our Antarctic                  specimen
possesses     88."     The genus is known from Greenland and from all
the oceans.
    We      discover     from   the preceding        notes    that    the following

   Of the remaining forms quoted               as common      to far southern as
vrell as to northern latitudes, there are a very considerable            number
in regard to which      I  for my part have no right to question their
identification,   yet they seem          to me to fall into a category          of
evidence   comparatively valueless          in support of a theory, by reason
of their    minute     size,   the   paucity of specimens        examined, the
similarity   of allied forms,        or from the circumstance that their
characters    are drawn      from hard parts alone,          in most   instances
from   a  shell, with no reference to the animal within.                It   must
be manifest that while        such    records swell the lists of apparently
discontinuous     distribution,      yet that    a  multitude of them      would
not carry     the    same     conviction      as  one  well-marked     and     un
mistakable Decapod or Cephalopod or Fish.                   In this category I
should    be    inclined     to    place    about   five   and    twenty    other

These coincidences are, to my mind, important, but they                                     are    far
from proving the "bipolar hypothesis."                                Information       is slowly
growing in regard to the affinities of the Japanese fauna with                                    that
of the western American coast, and this faunistic relation                               between
the Japanese, the          western American, and the far southern                            forms
is,   in my opinion, an important and indisputable one.
   After considering and deducting the forms enumerated                                     above,
the list with which we started shrinks into little space.                                   There
remains,       in the first place, the little Copepod Harpartiem fuhus,
found in the brackish pools of Kerguelen                            Island, which rather           be
longs to the question of the distribution                          of fresh-water animals,          a
problem totally distinct from that of the marine.                              We   next have       a
single Annelid,          Terebellides Stromii, M. Sars.                   The few remaining
forms belong either to the pelagic or to the abyssal fauna                                  of    the
ocean.         In   the former group wo have two instances,                       namely,
                             Ianthina rotundata, Leach.
                             Calanus finmarcliicus, Gunner.
The latter of these          is   the     commonest             and most widely distributed
of all the Copepods.              It    does not seem to be recorded from further
south than the Cape, its place being taken at Kerguelen by                                  C.   pro-
pinquuz, Brady,           which         occurs there in the same abundance                         as
C. Jhimarchicus           in Arctic        seas.          The former      is   widespread        over
the    Atlantic     ;   and neither of them                is   recorded, to my knowledge,
from further south than 35°                 S.     lat.

     These are the forms in regard to which the best evidence                                 exists,
and     it is by     no means       equal   or adequate       in them all, of specific
identity between examples                from the northern and southern                         seas.
In two of           them,     Pontasfer forcipatus and             Dyiaster            exilis, the
southern       form is described as a variety, and in the latter case as
perhaps a separate            species.      Differences or doubts are also men
tioned in the case of Euphronide*                depressa,     Klpidia glarialin, and
Stomias boa, and              the   small Ophiurids       probably            deserve         to be
re   examined before they bear the weight of                  a   theory.         But, setting
these minor doubts aside, we have                 in this last list           a   little     assem
blage of species            that, brought     together    for one purpose,                   has at
the     same    time another interest of its own.                        It    is framed to
include the safe and sure residuum of forms common to tlio North
Atlantic area and to the southern or Antarctic                      seas.         The species,
it is true, of which it consists             differ much in their known range,
several going no further south than 35° S. Int., and some having
a    great range       in longitude      as well as in latitude           ;   and even the
restricted      list contains instances        by no means so safe and sure in
their identification          as we    would desire.      Lut      such as        it   is,   the list
comprises       a   collection of deep-water        or abyssal           species        not only
remarkable        for their distribution, but on the whole (apart from its
Ophiuroids) conspicuous               as an assemblage    of peculiar and aberrant
forms.      I   submit that the facts are entirely inadequate                           to prove,
even for these species, or for the groups to which                            they belong,         a
principle      of bipolar distribution.          They     are in the main ancient
types, the meaning of whose                 wide distribution           has to be studied
in    each case     by itself.

   The following      is a    list of all   the  Fishes known from the Ker-
guelen area   :—
   TRAcnixiD^.
      Notothaenia.   — Seven        species   known from Kerguelen            Island,
         and one other from Marion Island.               One of the Kerguelen
         species is known         also from the Aucklands,          and   about five
         from    the     Falklands,     one   of which     ranges     also  to New
         Zealand.
      Harpagifer. — A single           species   only, known       from the Falk
         lands, Cape Horn,          Marion and Kerguelen Islands.
      Cluenichthgs.    — A single      species only, from Kerguelen.
   Dr Gunther       speaks of these       forms as representing the Cottoida
of the north     ;  but it is clear that this suggestion is meant                to be
interpreted in the most general way, merely               as we     sometimes      say,
for instance,     that the Humming-birds             of the New "World         are re
presented,    we might somewhat             better say replaced,       by the     Sun-
birds of the Old       ;  the   deer of northern regions by the antelopes
predominant in Africa;             the dog,    the   beaver,   the   bear, and the
mole of Europe by the Australian              Thylacine, Wombat, Koala,            and
Notoryctos.      Dr Gunther        says, immediately afterwards (Chall. Rep.,
Shore Fishes, p. 14), that such resemblance                  is an external one,
and   that "   there    is no such      relation between       the   representative
forms   as might be considered          to be genetic."      The two groups in
question belong to totally different families of fishes, and it will                 be
observed,    moreover,      that not only the species but the genera                 of
Trachinidse enumerated            have, so far as we know them at present,
a  clearly circumscribed          and    definitely   antarctic or subantarctic
habitat.

       Raia. — Of this         widely     distributed     genus,    two species     are
          known from, and peculiar to, Kerguelen.                 No   characters   are
          recorded     in which these resemble             European species more
          than those of the south and west of the American continent
          or of Japan.
   It  appears from this, that of thirteen fi.-hes that we know from
 Kerguelen,     not one fi*h,         and, with the exception          of  the cosmo-
]X)litan skate, no genus        of  fishes, extends     its nortliern range beyond
New Zealand and the Falklands.
   The resemblance          which Murray, following            Giinther, has drawn
between the fishes           of the northern and the southern temperate
zones is   another problem altogether.              Without entering further         on
this problem,      I  may refer at least to         the   two particular instances
quoted by     Murray,      the genera Trachichthys and Polyprion.
   Of Polyprion the northern species is exceedingly similar to, though
less elongate than, the southern form, and the two are united in a
single species by Goode and Bean.                  One or other occurs on both
sides  of the North Atlantic, at the Cape, at Juan Fernandez, and
in the Australian         region.      The southern form of this deep-water
fish has thus an immense range, and of the northern, Dr Giinther
says    (A. M.      N.     II.   (5),   xx.   p.   237,    1887),    "we     may   well
expect that     P. cernium will         be met    with far    beyond     the limits   of
the North-eastern           Atlantic."        Its discovery      oil' Newfoundland
(Goode and Bean,            p. 239)    is a beginning       of this anticipated ex
tension of its range.
   Murray       cites    from Giinther          the   genus     TracMchthys,       "by
which the family            Berycidce is represented in the southern tem
                                 " much more
perate zone,"      as   being                       nearly allied to the northern
than to the tropical genera."              But   the genus itself     is both tropical
and    northern,      for    one   species,    T. Dancinii,       Johnston,    is from
Madeira, and is said to be identical with T. japonims,                     St. and 1).,
from     Japan,    while T. intermedins, Hector, described                  from New
 Zealand, has more lately been discovered                 by Alcock     in the Bay of
Bengal     (A. M. N. H. (6), iv.          p. 380, 1889).
    Again, when the two genera, Sebaxfrs and Agonus, are quoted as
 Arctic    genera represented           in the Patagonian region, we must

remember that the latter is also represented                         in Chili and Van
couver,     as well    as   in    the       North Pacific, and that           Sebastes      is
described by Dr Giinther                (B. M. Cat., Fishes, ii.            p. 95) as an
"inhabitant of nearly all               the     seas,    but    not yet found on the
Atlantic     shores    of tiopical           America      and on the east coast of
Africa."
     Murray   again quotes       Dr Giinther in           regard    to the reappearance
in   the south of the        northern genus Lycodes, of which                     a single
specimen      of a new species was got in Magellan                      Strait.    Of    late
years     a good    many more closely allied forms of this deep-water
fish have been described,               and    go a good        way to bridge over its
area of distribution.       The expedition of the "Travailleur" obtained
one form,     L. albus, Vaillant, and American expeditions                  have obtained
various species in many localities, especially off California, and from
as far south as 24° north latitude.                     The not very remote Melano-
stigma gelatinomm, Giinther,                  has   been       taken in the Straits of
Magellan,      and somewhat abundantly                    off California.
     We happen        to have     a     considerable list of Isopoda              from the
Kerguelen area, and of these the following                         is an epitome    giving

    This species is represented by a single immature specimen          from

 genera    in this family, which    as a whole is cosmopolitan.

       A.   bathybius,   F. E. B.   900 fathoms, the Azores.
   The genus Anceus, of which several          northern forms are known,
was originally      named   in error from male individuals only, and is
now replaced in synonymy by the name Gnathia of Leach.
   Stebbing calls attention to the great differences between Bed-
dard's two southern forms and the type, and institutes the genus
Euneognathia        for the reception of the Kerguelen      species.  With
regard to     A. bathybius, Beddard,     he states that it " will no doubt

       Acanthocope has two species from                the Southern Ocean and
          Valparaiso, which two species are markedly different (Stab
          bing, Crustacea, p. 387).            Certain smaller genera of Alun-
          nopsida are still only known from the North Atlantic.
    It  appears      from this      list that   every   hnorcn Isopod    from     the
Antarctic area (with the single exception of Eurycope frayilu,
known also from Japan) is confined to that area, or the imme
diately     adjacent       seas,  one    species   only    extending    so   far   as
Valparaiso     ;  while those genera that are not limited to the southern
seas are cosmopolitan         in their distribution.
   Without dealing in similar detail with the Amphipods,                    we may
note that of fifty-eight species recorded            from the Kerguelen region
six    only   are    recorded     from    elsewhere,    four   of these    are   also
Australian,      and    of the remaining two, which alone are identical
with northern species, Stebbing says (Chall. Rep., " Amphipoda,"
p. 1135), in reference to one, namely, Podocerus falcatus (Mont.): —
" There is    the possibility, as       I have  elsewhere    suggested, that these
creatures    may have travelled out from our own waters                 along -with
the vessel to the southern latitudes in which they were captured."
The specimen of this species recorded from the Cape of Good Hope
is mentioned        as   having been taken from the screw             of the ship.
We     may also add that in this genus the pronounced sexual                 dimor
phism and the great changes undergone in the different stages of
growth have given rise to considerable confusion as to the exact
limits of many of the species, which confusion has not yet been
altogether removed.            While in     regard to the other,    Eusirus tonyi-
pes,    Sars     says    (Amphipoda,        Norway,     p.  421): — "The form
recorded     by the Bev.          Mr Stebbing under this          name    from the

  'Challenger'      Expedition       is  scarcely     identical    with   Boeck's
 species."
     The difficulty    and uncertainty attending          the examination       of
  forms,   even so highly      organised   as these,    may be illustrated     by
  the  following instance.
     The species now called Polycheria         antarctica, originally described
 by Stebbing from a dried specimen              taken from      a sponge   in the
 Antarctic Ocean       under the name Dexamine antarctica (A. M. N.
 H., (4) xv., p. 184), later transferred by him to the genus Atylus
 (A. M. N. H., (5) ii., p. 370), and now regarded by him as
 identical    with the form which         he   afterwards     described (Chall.
 Hep., Amphipods)         from Kerguelen        as  Tritwta   Jcergueleni  (under
 which name       it is cited in Murray's recent list as one of the
 species peculiar to Kerguelen), is in all probability identical with
 the forms described from Australia and New Zealand under the
 names Polycheria        tenuipes,    Haswell,   P. brevicornis, Haswell, and
 P. obtusa, Thomson.          In other words, this single       species has been
 described by so great and careful an authority as               Mr Stebbing    as
 two species     under three generic names, now replaced by a fourth,
and by other writers as three other distinct species.
     Of the genus       to which     this species    is  now ascribed, namely,
Polycheria, one other species only is known, from Puget Sound, in
Western North America,
                                    SUMMARY.
     The foregoing analysis shows that of some ninety species quoted
by    Murray    as common        to northern and southern localities while
absent from the intermediate zone, there are more than one-third
in which grave doubt as to their identification was expressed by
the original      describers,    or in which      the identification    has been
doubted      or denied by later writers.
     In somewhat      more     than another third the evidence of identity
is inconclusive      or even      inadmissible by reason of the nature of
the examination        to which the specimens were subjected            (as in the
case of      the horny and calcareous          sponges), or by reason of the
small size of the objects and lack of adequate                  marks of charac

terisation (as in the case of the minute Ostracod and Molluscan
shells).
    Of  the remaining       forms, about a dozen       find  their   northern
representatives      in the Japanese seas, where they form part of a
fauna predominantly southern in its relations, and where at least
the occurrence       of any particular form cannot be taken, ipso facto,
as evidence    of  a  boreal centre of distribution.
    Both   these   last forms and the remnant of equal number that
are quoted as occurring        in the North Atlantic    as well as in or near
the Southern Ocean, are for the most part deep-water species, and
have   in a large proportion of cases peculiar characters       of their own.
We cannot      say at present that they are forms characteristic of        any
particular geographical province, and their specific area         of distribu
tion has in some cases been greatly extended since the date of their
original discovery.
    Turning, in conclusion, to particular groups, we find the bipolar
hypothesis specifically rejected by Prof. Herdman             in  the case   of
the Tunicata, by Prof. Ludwig in that of the Holothurians, and by
Dr Ortmann in that of the Crustacea ; and (to limit ourselves to
 the groups that we have particularly        discussed) we have found no
single species of fish, of Decapod, of Isopod, no certain one out of
a large fauna       of Amphipods, to inhabit at        once  the Arctic and
 Antarctic   Oceans,     or the regions adjacent -thereto.
    Before leaving this subject in the meantime, it is proper to admit
 that the question of specific identity between        Arctic or sub-Arctic
 and Antarctic or sub-Antarctic        forms is not the only evidence,     and
 not necessarily the most important          evidence,  by which to decide
 the truth of the "bipolar hypothesis."          In the distribution    of the
 land mammalia,        the existence of a northern circumpolar or circum-
 terrestrial region is unaffected by questions of the specific        identity
 of, among     many other examples,         the   European    and American
 bison, beaver, elk, or reindeer.        And though,   on the one hand, the
 separate existence      in the Arctic and Antarctic of one or more well-
 marked     types     of fish or higher invertebrates, of whose specific
 identity there could be no question, would bo the simplest proof of
 a sound basis    in the bipolar theory, yet, without any such cases of
 specific identity, the theory might still find firm support if it could
 be shown that similar and truly allied forms gave to the two region*

 a common      facies.     We have     seen that, as regards the fish, even
 such a likeness as this is certainly absent          ; even   such a likeness is
 explicitly   denied by Ortmann for the Crustacea,               and by Ludwig
 for the Holothurians       ; nor do    I  myself, in the case of any other
 group,   see signs  of its existence.

not merely a large variety of C. finmarcMcus, which is known to
occur off the Canaries in 30" N. lat., as well               as  off Australia    in
37° S. lat., and which, according to Thompson, is also                   present  in

       Note on Dew Bows. By C. G. Knott, D.Sc, and
                B. A. Lundie, M.A., B.Sc, M.B., CM.
                           (Read December 19, 1898.)
    A  dew bow differs from        a  fog bow in being formed by minute
globules of water resting on the ground          ; but these globules may or
may not have been produced by the usual process of dew formation.
In   the Proceedings    of  the   Society (vol. vii., 1870), Clerk Maxwell
has published      a note on   a  bow seen on ice.       With the exception
of this record, we have been unable to find any distinct account of
observations of the phenomenon, although no doubt it must have
been occasionally observed        soon after sunrise.
    The peculiarity     of the bows we observed was that they were
seen by night, the sources of        light being   the gas lamps and electric
lights of the city.       It  was on the evening of Friday, November
11, after several days        of thick     foggy weather.       The    tiny fog
particles seem to have gradually          settled down in the      still air, the
fog steadily clearing the whole time.            These globules, in spite of
their contact with the damp ground, must have retained                       their
spherical form almost perfectly         ; for they were able to throw back
to the eye, with a rainbow deviation of approximately 42°, the                light
incident upon them.
    In  the neighbourhood        of every lamp where the surface of the
 ground had been undisturbed by traffic the bows were                    seen    as
 bright streaks,     which shifted position with the observer.                 Any
 disturbance of the surface,          a   wheelmark, a footprint,       a   finger
 drawn across the pavement,          obliterated the bright streak      ;  and it
 was not seen on the surface of puddles.             On stooping, we saw the
 bow run from us along the ground             ; and as we moved, it moved
 with us.      "With the gas lamp as        a source  of light the streak was
 of one colour     ;  but with the more powerful           electric light as the
 source   it was possible   to distinguish rainbow tints.
     Every drop of water that        is efficient in producing the bow must
 be the vortex of a triangle, whose base              is the line joining the
  source   of light and the eye of the observer,           and whose      vertical

angle is about 42°.        Hence, all possible bow-producing drops must
lie on or near the surface described             by the revolution     about this
line of the circle which circumscribes any one of these triangles.
The     plane   sections     of   this  toroidal    surface   give   the   various
forms of dew bow that may be seen on level ground.                       Many of
these have a heart shape ; and           if  the eye of the spectator were       on
the level of the ground the two halves of the curve,                     which     is
symmetrical       with   regard      to  the   vertical   plane  containing     the
source     and the eye, would form a cusp-like point as they met at
the eye.
     The equation of       the   dew bow referred         to the   stance   of the
observer as origin is easily shown to be
        (r°
            - ar cos 0 + hKf= cos!a(r2 + /i2)(r" - 2ar cos 6 + o' + W)
 where r, 6 are the usual polar co-ordinates,              H  the height of the
source of light, h the height of the observer's eye, a the horizontal
 distance between the eye and the source of light, and a the angle
 of maximum deviation of any particular ray which has suffered
 two refractions and one reflection in the drop.                     By choosing
 different    values for r, and solving for            6,  we can very rapidly
 trace any particular case by points.              The particular    form of the
 curve will of course depend upon the relative values                    of h, H,
 and    a.
      A  set of curves for different values of these constants may be
 traced out with great          ease   by means of a triangular frame with
 two    grooves cut on    it  so as to meet at the proper angle of 42°, the
 grooves being made to slide simultaneously on the top3 of two
 pillars, of which the one represents            the lamp post     and the other
 the observer.       The point where the grooves             meet  will  trace out
 the required curve on any chosen               plane surface,    and indeed on
 any surface whatsoever.
      Clerk Maxwell, in his        note on the bow observed       on ice, says   : —
  " How     a drop of water can lie upon ice without              wetting it and
  losing its shape altogether,       I do   not profess to explain."
      In  the phenomenon described           in this paper    a similar   difficulty
  meets us.      We have all seen dew drops of different sizes more or
   less distorted   from the spherical form          ;  but not usually on the

formation of dew bows is a multitude of minute drops of nearly
the same size, and of so small a diameter that the sphericity is           not
appreciably disturbed.        Here we must suppose       that the impact
of the drops on the ground itself,         or on the drops already lying
there, was so extremely gentle that        it did not break through    their
surface-films.    The well-defined character of the bows observed           at
distances  of 10 or 20 yards from      a   dim gas lamp proves at once       a
great  uniformity   in the     size of the drops,    and a practically     in
numerable multitude of them.         The only meteorological conditions
under which such uniformity could be attained are what we              have
already described,    viz., a calm,  still, foggy air, permitting the     fog
particles to settle gently down upon the ground with             a terminal
speed of, at most, an inch per second.

 that the phenomenon was observed by some of the night               police
 men   on  the   two   previous    ovenings of Xovember        9   and   10,
 while the fog was still dense, as well as on the 11th, when             we
noticod it.     The bows are said to have been much brighter              on
 the last night than on the two previous ones         ; and on that   night
 to have increased   in brilliancy towards morning.

On the            Eliminant of a Set of Quadrics, Ternary or Qua

     1.    There are two methods for expressing in determinant                                                           form
the eliminant of three ternary quadrics.                                    If   ti, v,   xo     are tho quadrics
and        J     their Jacobian               we       may eliminate                  dialytically             tho           ton
quantities          x3, y3, z3, y2z,             yz2, z-x,   zx2,      x-y,      xy2,     xyz from the ton
cubics xu,           yu,    zu, xv, yv, zv, xw, yic, zw,                    J.        This       is in effect                the
process given               by Sylvester               in 1841.*            The other method                             is to
eliminate           dialytically         the six quantities x2, y2,                        z2,   yz, zx, xy from
«,   r,    w   and the three differentials of tho Jacobian.                               t
     2.    The eliminant                of four quaternary quadrics may bo found in
determinant form by                     a   process having points in common                                   with oath
of       these    two methods.                   Multiplying          each       of the quadrics by the
variable's          x, y,    z,    w    in turn         we   get       sixteen quaternary cubics,
and we           have also the four differentials of tho Jacobian.                                             Thus we
have in          all twenty quaternary                  cubics, or      just sufficient                   to eliminate
dialytically          the twenty expressions                     x3,    .    .   .   ,   x2y,    .    .    . xyz,        .   .
                                                                                                                             .
The result          is   a determinant of order 20, and of the correct degree,
viz.,     8,   in the coefficient of                 each quadric.
     It    does not appear to bo possible                       to extend this process so as to
obtain,          in determinant               form, froe         from extraneous factors,                                    the
eliminant of a set of quadrics in more than four variables.

what is the same thing, the third order determinant (4).

   In     continuation          of former investigations             of the alteration           of
compressibility             of water, which is produced by dissolving various
salts in       it,
                I      was led to imagine that some instructive results might
l)e furnished by solutions such as those of sugar,                              whose    bulk    is
nearly        the sum of the bulks of their constituents                    :   — for, in them,
¦we   might expect little change in compressibility from that of water
itself   ;     i.e.    in   accordance     with my hypothetical                 formula,   little
change in the term regarded                     as representing the molecular pres

the corresponding piezometers),                but they are all fairly satisfied                       by

                                            (Read December 19, 1898.)
         When lecturing               on Electrostatics             at the Glasgow and West of
    Scotland Technical                     College, the        author    endeavoured to impress
    upon his students the identity of the laws of force for magnetism
    and electricity at rest.                   He thought it would further this               idea      if   he
    could get pictures of electrostatic lines analogous to those obtained
    from magnets by means                        of iron filings, and an analysis of the
    difference of the conditions in the two cases led to the conclusion
    that there was no reason why this should not be done.
         When we shower iron filings upon                             a glass plate, or a sheet               of
    paper, under which a magnet is placed, unlike poles are induced at
    the ends         of   each filing, and         it   becomes       for the time being          a     little
    compass          needle.         Since it is very short, the total action upon it
    will   be a couple turning                  it into        the direction     of the force at its
    centre, unless            it   be close to the magnet,            in which    case there      will       be,
    in addition,          a   translation       along a line of force.             This latter         effect
    causes the filings to crowd towards the edges of the magnet.
      Now, in electrostatics we also have an inductive action, opposite
    charges being induced in the near and far ends of each particle as
mat      comes into the field, but we have the important difference, that
W whereas        the magnetic poles are attached to the filing and cannot
J   be separated          from       it,   the electric charges         will   leave   a   body   if   they
    have an opportunity                    of doing so.            To avoid this difficulty        as    far
    as   possible,        the substance          we employ should have some insulat
    ing qualities to prevent the immediate escape of the charges, and
    yet should be             a    sufficiently good conductor to allow enough elec
    trical separation to take place.                       Further, each particle should be
    greater     in   one dimension than                 in the other two, in order that there
    may be      a    tendency to bring           it     into   a   definite direction.

      An ideal material would            consist     of little long-shaped grains              hav
ing    a   conducting interior within an insulating shell, such as                           metal
filings covered with a thick coating of insulating                        varnish, but            the
author has not yet been able to experiment on these lines.                                         He
first used fine sawdust, and better results have been obtained by                                  its
use than from           any other materials he has since tried.                            Among
these are iron filings, magnetic                   sand     (powdered        Fe304), tea             (as
purchased), oatmeal, and boar's bristles cut into very short                                pieces.
Tea seems       a   good material, but the curliness of the leaves spoils the
appearance          of the curves, while oatmeal               is   rather coarse, although
it    does show something.               The bristles gave no result at all, while
the    filings and sand           were     thrown         off without     forming          curves.
Probably the former conducts too feebly and the latter too well.
     All   the photographs are from curves taken            with mahogany saw
dust coloured with ink except               three, for which tea was employed.
     As    a   first trial, one     side    of each           of three glass            plates was
varnished with shellac, and pieces of tinfoil were stuck on it.                                One
plate had       a    single circular disc of tinfoil placed at its centre,                           a
second had two discs, and the               third had two parallel strips.
     The first plate was then supported horizontally                         by two        wooden
blocks at its ends with the varnished side downwards, so that                                        a
spring of thin wire would make contact with the disc.                               This    spring
rested on      a   glass plate, and was connected to one pole of an ordinary
Wimshurst machine.                Sawdust was sprinkled on the plate from                            a
muslin bag whilst the machine was running                        ;   but, instead of giving
pictures of the lines of force,               it     jumped         off again as soon         as   it
touched the glass.          The other plates were tried, one piece of tinfoil
being connected         to each pole of the machine, but with like                        results.
     The author next tried putting the dust on before charging                                    the
foil, and then tapping the plate when the machine was                                      started.
This proved         more   satisfactory, for, although the powder flew                             off
as   formerly, just before doing so           it    formed itself partly into definite
lines.      By putting       on    larger pieces of tinfoil and stopping                          the
machine the instant the powder began                           to get thrown            outwards,
good curves were obtained on all three plates.
     The plates were then cleaned and heated, and                        a   thin       coating    of
a    mixture of paraffin wax and vaseline was applied to that side                                 of
the plate on which there was no                    tinfoil,    i.e., to the side on which

the curves were made.                When this had            set, new curves were made
and were fixed hy heating them                  until       the wax melted.

with this exception, all the photographs have                             been taken                 from
curves      specially made on clear unvarnished                       glass,   and not fixed.
Glasses from photographic              plates were used, three of them being
whole-plate size and the remainder half-plate.                         The first illustration
shows the apparatus itself, as arranged for getting the lator curves.
The glass plate lies horizontally in               a    wooden frame held in                    a   retort
stand,    while two wires            or electrodes,           standing on a glass plate,
make contact          with    the tinfoil.        Each of these wires is about 24
centimetres      long, and carries        a   little sliding      piece at the top, which
is pressed      upwards by a spring so as to ensure contact.                                    It    was
found that this method of supporting the                         plate loosely caused the
least confusion from vibration figures.
   In order to          get a perfect control               of the action, the electrodes
are     connected to the poles of the                       machine through                a    pair of
thick    bare wires lying on the glass table.                         Another        wire is laid
across    these so as to short circuit the machine                     until all      is ready.
   The sawdust, or other material, is spread as uniformly as possible
over the plate by means of a sieve or muslin bag, and the                                           Wims-
hurst is set agoing.           The cross wire is lifted, and, while the foil is
being charged,          the wooden frame (or the arm holding it) should                                 be
briskly tapped.             The short circuit wire is dropped again whenever
the dust begins to move               outwards from the tin.                   This motion              is
caused        by the attracted         charge      being deposited              on        the       glass,
leaving       only    the repelled charge              on    the dust.         It    is    so        great
immediately          over the tinfoil that that part is very often cleared of
dust altogether.            The secret of getting good results lies in stopping
the action at the right moment.
   When there is only one piece of tinfoil on the plate,                                   only one
electrode is used, and when two pieces have to receive like charges,
the     two    electrodes      are    connected         together and to one                     of the
horizontal wires.            In both   these      cases the      other horizontal wire is
still left connected          to its pole      of the machine, but                  is,   of course,
 not allowed to touch the electrodes.
      The curves obtained            in this manner            were     photographed in                 a
reducing camera          fixed to     a   wall,   so    that its axis was vertical and

  §    7.   To suit      the        case of solitary     waves     we shall suppose                     the
arbitrary function            f(t)     to have any arbitrarily          given value for all
values of     t   from    0    to   t, and   to be zero    for all negative               values of      t
and all positive values                   greater than t.        Thus   t   is     what we may
call the transit-time of the wave, that                    is,   the time     it     takes to pass
any fixed plane parallel to its front               ;   or the time during which any
point of the medium                  is   moved by it.      The thicknesses,                or, as we
shall sometimes say, the wave-lengths, of the two kinds of waves
are   «t and m respectively, being for                  the same transit-times directly
as the propagational velocities.
  §    8.   And now for our problem of reflexion and refraction. At
present      we need not occupy ourselves with the case of purely
distortional        with vibratory motions perpendicular to the
                       waves
plane of the incident, reflected, and refracted rays. It was fully
solved by Green  * with an arbitrary function to express the char
acter of the motion (including therefore the case of                          a      solitary wave
or of an infinite procession                 of simple harmonic waves).   He showed

electro-magnetic waves of one of the two orthogonal polarizations,

dence,     reflexion,   and refraction   ;  nor has   any one, so far as      I

force or of magnetic force that are perpendicular          to that plane    in
the case of light polarized by reflexion at the surface of a trans
parent medium.          For  the action, whatever its physical character

may    be, which      takes  place  perpendicular to that plane,      they  all
seem     to prefer    "electric displacement," of which        the only   con
ceivable     meaning is motion of electricity to and fro perpendicular
to the plane.      If   they had declared, or even suggested, definitely
this motion of ether, they would have been perfectly in harmony
with the undulatory theory of light as we have it from Young and
Fresnel.       We shall return to this very simple problem of reflexion
and refraction of purely distortional waves in which the motion is
perpendicular to the plane of the three rays, in order to interpret
in   the    very simplest case the      meaning, for    a solitary wave,     of

normal and tangential forces on either at the interface to be those
calculated from the strains according to the ordinary elastic solid

which is Fresnel's "sine-formula"; a very surprising and interest
ing result.        It  has long been known                that  for vibrations perpen
dicular   to the plane of the incident, reflected,                    and refracted rays,
unequal densities            with     equal     rigidities    of    the    two      mediums,
whether compressible               or incompressible, gives Fresnel's sine-law                  :
and unequal rigidities, with equal densities,                    gives his tangent-law.
But for vibrations              in   the plane        of the three        rays,    and both
mediums incompressible, unequal rigidities                         with equal densities
give, as was       shown by Rayleigh              in 1871,*      a complicated formula
for    the reflected          ray,    vanishing        for  two     different       angles    of
incidence, if the           motive forces         in   the waves        are   according       to
the law of the elasticity of an ordinary solid.                          Now     we find     for
vibrations in the plane of the rays, Fresnel's sine-law, with its
continual increase of reflected ray with increasing angles of
incidence up to 90°,             if the restitutional        forces    follow the law of
dependence         on rotation which           I   have    suggested     t for     ether,   and
if the    waves      of condensation and rarefaction travel at velocities
small in comparison            with those of waves of distortion.
    § 15.   Interesting, however,           as   this may be in respect to an ideal
 problem of dynamics, it seems quite unimportant                             in the wave-
 theory of light        ;   because      Stokes     I  has   given, as     I   believe,    irre
 fragable proof that in light polarized by reflexion the vibrations
 are perpendicular to the plane of the incident                        and reflected rays,
 and therefore, that it is for vibrations in this plane that Fresnel's
 tangent-law is fulfilled.
    § 16.    Of our       present     results,   it is (35) of     § 14    which is really
 important     ;   inasmuch        as   it shows that Fresnel's tangent-law is
 fulfilled for vibrations in the plane of the rays, with the rotational
 law of force;       as   I had found it in 1888 § with the elastic-solid-law
 of force  ; provided only that the propagational velocities of condensa
 tional waves are small in comparison with those of the waves                                 of
 transverse      vibration which constitute light.
    § 17.    By (28)       we see that when a-1, the velocity of the wave-
 trace on the interface of the                 two mediums,          is greater      than the

      These real resultants of imaginary waves are not plane waves.
 They are forced                  linear waves            sweeping the interface, on which
 they travel with velocity                         a"1; and they                      produce     disturbances
 penetrating to but small distances into the medium to which thoy
 belong.           Their interpretation                   in connection with total internal
 reflexion, both for vibrations                        in      the     plane of the rays,              and for
 the     simpler         case of        vibrations         perpendicular       (for     to this plane
 which there             is   essentially no condensational wave), constitutes the
 dynamical theory of Fresnel's rhomb for solitary waves.

    The publication of Mr Hanson's paper on the glissette elimination
problem       (Proc. Roy. Soc, vol. xxii.                 p. 158) lias led me to make                       a
further investigation of this interesting point, with the result that
the general        eliminant is expressed                 in the form of                      a   single sym
metrical bordered determinant.                       I   shall first give the solution for
the case where the tracing-point is on the axis of the ellipse,                                          and
then extend        it   to the general       case.

This   is the same locus as is brought                             out by          Mr Sanson                         (p. 160 of
his paper) by            a   different method of solution.                               To explain                   the want
of an absolute               term Mr Nanson points out that the origin                                                        is a
conjugate point, which                         follows       from          the     fact that in the                           form
first given the roots of                       &4(x2 +   if)       are imaginary.
     These results may be verified by finding                                             the          equation of              the

considered      the definite algebraic expression                          for the glissette of an
Ellipse or Hyperbola.
  For certain loci of               the tracing-point, the eliminant                       is   simplified
by losing    a       considerable number of its terms.                               Comparing               the
original and the abbreviated forms of (1) and (2) of the complete
equation (p. 383), we observe that
        A    = a2cos2a + 62sin2a             - r2.              C   = 62cos2a + a2sin2a.
And   (1), for       A=   0,   the locus of the tracing-point                       is   determined by
                                      a2cos2a   +     62sin2a      - r2.
The locus of the tracing-point                         in this       case     is    the    pedal of the
generating ellipse from centre                       as   origin of the perpendiculars on
tangents,       and this includes the case of the tracing-point                                      at the
vertex of the ellipse.

the distance of the centre of the ellipse from the origin,                                      it   follows
that every glissette having its tracing-point on the circle repre
sented byA         = + passes through the origin, as

evident from the fact that when                       y   is   reduced to       - (zr + y") the abso
lute term of the equation disappears.

             The    Action of Persulphates on Iodine.
                       By Hugh Marshall, D.Sc.
                            (Read December 19, 1898.)
    When solutions of potassium           persulphate and potassium             iodide
are    mixed, iodine is liberated          and potassium         sulphate formed.
The reaction takes place somewhat              slowly in the cold, much more
rapidly    on warming.        It    has generally been        supposed      that    the
equation
                        2KI + K2S208 = I2 + 2K,S04
completely represents the action which takes place, and although
I  have   had occasion     to try the reaction very many times since                   I
first  noted  it  as  a reaction for persulphates,           it  was only about a
year ago that    I  observed a further change.
    A solution of    potassium     iodide was being boiled with ammonium
persulphate (which is much more soluble than the potassium salt)
in order to decompose it and drive off the iodine by sublimation.
It    was observed     that     the free iodine in the          liquid    seemed      to
disappear    very rapidly, more        so  than   corresponded       to the amount
volatilised, and that the final disappearance               of the brown colour
took place     with unexpected          suddenness.        This pointed        to    the
possible   conversion of the iodine into some compound, probably
by the oxidising action of the persulphate.               This proved to be the
case,   because,   on the cautious addition          of sulphurous acid to the
colourless   solution, iodine again appeared          ;  on standing, the        liquid
again    became     decolourised,      and was      again      turned     brown       by
sulphurous acid.        These     operations could be repeated            so long as
persulphate remained in             the solution.       The    action takes place
slowly in the cold, and at high temperatures                there is considerable
volatilisation of iodine     ;   when a solution of potassium iodide was
corked up      with    ammonium         persulphate in       a   test tube     at    the
ordinary    temperature,       the iodine     which     separated      in   the solid
form     gradually dissolved on         further standing, and           had   entirely
disappeared    in the course of several days.            The oxidation product

was not further         investigated at the time            ;  it  was assumed        to be
iodic acid.
     Some months ago, my attention                 was again      called to the subject
by     seeing    an    abstract        of   a   paper on      the     determination         uf
chlorine,     bromine, and iodine in organic compounds by distilling
the substance         with    a   mixture of sulphuric          acid   and persulphate.
The      possible     oxidation        of   iodine    under    these    conditions        was
apparently       overlooked, and the method may therefore not be                            so
accurate     for that substance          as  in the case   of chlorine or bromine         ;  it
 was therefore       important to have the nature of the action definitely
settled by isolating some of the product.                     For this    purpose,       four
 or five grams      of iodine were digested           in an Erlenmeyer         flask    with
 a   strong solution      of ammonium persulphate, the quantity                       taken
 being    more     than sufficient to convert             the iodine into       periodate.
 The loosely-corked flask              was placed on an ordinary heating coil,
 so   that its temperature varied from 10°-15"                    during the night to
 30'-35° during the day.                In  the   course of   fully   a week    the whole
 of the   iodine had dissolved and oxidised, and in its place there was                       a
 moderate      quantity of       a   white crystalline      solid.     This  was    filtered
 off,   washed      with     a   little cold water,         and     recrystallised      from
 solution in hot water.               Its solution     was strongly acid,        free from
 sulphate, and gave all the ordinary                 reactions     of an iodate      and of
 an ammonium          salt ;   it was evidently ammonium hydrogen iodate.
  The     original    mother       liquor     and    washings,       containing      chiefly
  ammonium         hydrogen         sulphate,     were   neutralised     with     ammonia
  solution, whereupon a considerable quantity                      of  white crystallii.e
  precipitate formed,         probably normal ammonium iodate.                     In order
  to   prove conclusively           that it was iodate and            not periodate,        i!s
  oxidising power was determined by means of potas.»ium iodide and
  sulphuric acid, the liberated iodine being titrated with an empirical
   solution of sodium thiosulphate.               The titre of the latter was found
   by comparison        with     pure     ammonium        iodate    prepared      by other
   methods.       It   was thus found            that   0"1540     grams    of substance
   corresponded to a volume of                 thiosulphate     solution equivalent to
   0'1534 grams of ammonium iodate.                     There is therefore no doubt
   that   persulphate     oxidises iodine to iodic acid.
       Since the above     investigation was carried out there has appeared
    a paper   on the action of potassium persulphate on potassium                    iodide,

390         Proceedings      of Roycd Society of Edinburgh.
by T. S. Price.*      In it  the author gives the result of his investiga
tions on the rate of the reaction at different concentrations, and
on the effects   which other substances            have   when present in the
solution.   He finds that the reaction is           one of the second degree,
not of the third, as was anticipated.            It  therefore  agrees  with the
equation
                           KI + KS04 = I + K2S04
rather than
                        2KI   + K2S2Og =      I, + 2K2S04
although all molecular weight determinations lead to the doubled
formula for persulphuric acid.           The solutions dealt with in Price's
investigation were dilute, and it is impossible to say what effect
the liberated iodine       would have        on the    rate  of decomposition    ;
there may be a     certain amount of " catalytic action,"             the iodine
being alternately oxidised          by    the  persulphate     and reduced    by
hydriodic    acid.     The     reaction      investigated    may    not  be  the
comparatively    simple one represented           by the equation
                           S108" +     2I'-I, + 2S04"
but may really be the much more complex one, as represented                   by
the additional   equations

   I    am very glad to embrace                          the opportunity               of addressing the
Fellows        of    the           Royal      Society        of     Edinburgh,          many of          whose
members         have contributed                     much to our knowledge                          of Oceano
graphy.         For instance, your President, Lord Kelvin,                                          besides    his
researches on the tides, is well known                                 to practical seamen from his
excellent        compasses                and       sounding           machines    ;     your        Secretary,
Prof.      Tait,     is       well known              from        his researches         on the pressure
errors      of deep-sea                  thermometers         ;    Dr Alexander           Buehan has             a
world-wide reputation in the department of oceanic                                             meteorology          ;
the late       Prof. Dittmar                 was a great           authority on the chemistry of
sea     water.           It       is enough to say that                   Sir Wyville Thomson, Mr
J. Y.       Buchanan,               and Sir          John Murray,             were       members         of    the
"Challenger"              Expedition,               which has given the world such valuable
information about the depths of the                                sea.
      Of    course,           it    is    not with        the       intention      of     giving        to    such
scientific      authorities              a   lesson     that       I   address     the    Society, but if
 you represent                scientists,       I   represent the seamen,                and it is useful
 from time to time to have a talk between                                   these two classes of men.
 Every scientific study should be started by the scientist, but the
 sooner they can associate                          ordinary        practical men with the work
 the better         it will be.               We practical              seamen     are more            numerous
 than scientists              ;    we constantly navigate the sea, and we have more
 opportunities            of making contributions                         to science      than they have.
 Certainly, they can make their observations in                                         a more        exact way
 than we can, but the                        laws of nature — particularly those concern
 ing Oceanography — are so imperfectly known,                                          that there        is very
 much to be done even by the rough hands of the ordinary seamen.
       There    are       three          principal      elements          to be studied at sea                with
 regard        to    Oceanography :— the                      temperature of              the        water,    the
 specific gravity                  of the same, and the currents.                         I     need    not say
 how easy           it    is to make observations on                         the   temperature of the
  surface water;                  there is only one precaution, that                          is,   not to forget
  that the correction of the                         thermometer should be known, and of

course water should be brought to the thermometer in such a way
as not to be subject to a change of temperature                                   in the meanwhile.
   The determination                   of the specific          gravity of water was for                     a
long time considered                   as a delicate piece              of work, which could be
done only by the hands of the scientist.                                It   was very brave of me
to dare to take in hand the hydrometer, but                                   I    became    in    a   short
time master of this ordinary sort of work.                         After taking               charge of
this operation in 1886,                 I, being   a    captain then, handed it               to all my
officers on board, and was really glad to see that every one of them
was as particular about                 the exactness          of the observations as a man
who is accustomed to do this kind of work.                                   It   may be interesting
to mention that out of ten instruments                            given to the officers of the
watch only two were broken after six thousand observations had
been made during the three years' voyage                                uninterruptedly           in good
weather and bad.              The association                of all the officers          in this work
gave      me   very great           assistance.             When        the work         is done       by    a
scientist,     observations of specific                     gravity may be taken once                       or
several times         a day,       but,   as    every officer of the watch could do it
on board       my ship,       I    sometimes           had observations made every five
minutes.        It    is    not necessary              in ordinary           circumstances         to de
termine the specific               gravity of the water every five minutes, but
if you     cross a certain current and wish to know the                                    limits of        it,
you have to increase the number of observations.
 I     wish to draw your attention to one fact, which                                       should not
be neglected.              The hydrometer               changes         its position, and conse
quently its reading,              when you place the thermometer in the same
vessel.    I    found        out this           fact        and published           it    in my        book
Le Vitiaz        et    pacifique (paragraph 58).
                       VOcean                                                         Dr Kriimmel,
of Kiel, afterwards studied this subject particularly.                                    I   mention
thio fact because           it    is   better    not to have the                  thermometer in             \
vessel in which the hydrometer                         is   floating.        In any      case, observa
tions of the specific              gravity should be done in the same way in
which the errors of the hydrometer were determined.
 I     will now show you                the results of my work                     done    at different
times,     from 1881 to 18S9.                    My     books      and papers are published
chiefly in the Russian language, and for this reason they are not
very well known in this country.                        I       cannot,      in the course of my
address,     make     you familiar             with all my works, and wish only to

draw      your        attention      to     the     interesting        phenomena           of double
currents      in the Straits              of Bosphorus, Gibraltar,               Bab-el-Mandeb,
Formosa, and           La Pe rouse.
     The Strait of Bosphorus joins the                       Black     Sea and the Marmora
Sea.      The Black            Sea water           has    in it — roughly           speaking — half
the quantity of salt found in the water of tho Mediterranean.                                     The
water of the           lower strata         of the Marmora                Sea has the same com
position as the water of the Mediterranean.                                The upper strata, say
from ten fathoms upward, contain water of intermediate salinity
between        the water of the Mediterranean                         and     the    water of the
Black Sea (see Plate     fig. 1). This difference in the salinity of
                                    I.,
the water   the chief reason of the enormous double current of the
                is
Bosphorus.            Let    us imagine that at          a   certain given moment the level
of both seas          is    at the same height.               The     pressure      of tho column
of   water in the Marmora Sea                     will   be greater       than that in the Black
Sea   ;   the difference would increase                      with the depth and             it   would
disappear at the surface.                   For this         reason   the water in the lower
strata of the Marmora Sea rushes into the Black Sea, keeping close
to the bottom.               That rush of water after                 a   certain time will raiso
the    level of the Black Sea, producing                       a   difference       in the level of
the    two    seas,    which causes          a    superficial current to flow out of the
Black Sea in the opposite                    direction to the under current.                      Here
we see       distinctly that tho principal reason for the double current
is    the difference          in the        salinity of the water,              and should that
difference in salinity cease the double current would be discontinued.
The fact       is   that in tho Black             Sea evaporation does not exceed the
quantity       of water supplied by rains and streams,                              and    this excess
of fresh water maintains the difference                         of salinity in the waters of
the Black Sea and Mediterranean.
      The existence          of double currents in the Bosphorus was known
long ago, and           Marsilli in        1681,     in his letter to Queen Christina of
Sweden, has described                them.         Later, they were somehow forgotten,
and some interesting                 papers        have      been published,          in   which tho
authors        try     to    prove that           the     doublo current            was    legendary.

" Taman."       I began    to take observations      of the specific     gravity of
the water at different depths, and        I  found out that the water form
ing the lower strata contained twice           as   much salt     aS  the water of
the upper strata    ; after this a double current was quite.evident to me.
    In order  to measure the velocity of both currents,             I invented the
instrument     which is shown on Plate             II.     It  consists  of a pro
peller revolving on      a  horizontal spindle.       A   bell is attached   to the
propeller, the tongue of which is arranged to move on an axle in
one direction    ; at every revolution of the propeller           it strikes twice,
and,   as  water is   a  very good conductor of sound, the number of
revolutions could be counted through the bottom of the ship (pro
vided the ship is not sheathed with wood) at all depths to which
the instrument was lowered (40 fathoms).              To this instrument gaveI
the name of fluctometer,       and  I used  it during     the whole year, lower
ing it on a wire rope with ballast of 80 lbs. of lead attached below.
   Plate I. fig.   2  shows the velocity of both currents in feet per
second,    and the specific       gravity  of the water in each stratum.
Observations were made every two hours, and the specific gravity
of water from every depth was taken at the same time when the
velocity of the current was observed.
    I  do not wish to keep you long with the different interesting
details, and will only point out to you that the lower current is
similar in many details to an ordinary river, while, on the contrary,
the upper current differs much from an ordinary                    river, probably
from the reason that, while the surface of it is falling gradually
down, the bottom rises constantly (see Plate I. fig. 1).
    The difference of level of the Black Sea and Marmora                         Sea
calculated from the difference in the specific gravity of the water
I found    for the month of      July  1882 to be 1-396 feet.
    In  the Strait of Gibraltar     I  had only five stations, and made my
observations     one day only.      I had no opportunity of measuring the
velocity of the current, but the phenomenon is very similar to what
 I found in the Bosphorus.          Plate  III.   shows a section of the Gib
raltar Strait and the Mediterranean           as  far  as   the Syrian coast.     Of
 course,   the Mediterranean is given in         a  different longitudinal scale
from that of Gibraltar Strait.          As shown by        the diagram,   the water
 of the  Atlantic  rushes into the Mediterranean, the difference            between
 the surface levels being, according to my calculations, 0'54 feet.

    The evaporation of water from the                     Mediterranean         is greater
than the quantity supplied by rivers and rains.                         For this     reason,
the water     becomes     more dense, settles down, and goes back to the
Atlantic by the under current.
    I wish to point out          here     that the       temperature of the lower
strata of the      Mediterranean         coincides with the mean winter tem
perature of the air        in  the eastern       part of the       sea.    This    is quite
evident, because       in winter    the     temperature      of the water to        a great
depth corrasponds        to the temperature           of the air.       In  summer,       the
surface water is much warmer, but this high temperature cannot
penetrate to a great         depth.        I  am sorry that        I  have    not time to
discuss     more    fully this question, but in               the    Straits of Bab-el-
Mandeb we have          the same phenomena               as in the      Gibraltar      Strait
and    Mediterranean.         Here again       — by my observations — the               tem
perature     of the lower water strata coincides                 with the winter tem
perature of the air at the place where the water settles down.
    In  the three straits already mentioned, we have a double current                         :
superficial and bottom current.                In  the Straits of Formosa and La
Perouse there are also two currents,               but both are superficial.
    I  ought to mention that the influence of the rotation of the
earth on the direction and velocity of the                  currents cannot be over
estimated.       I   shall not discuss         this question fully,        but the fact
that in every salt inland             sea    there    is a circular rotation of the
water in a direction opposite            to the apparent movement              of the win,
shows that the rotation           of the earth has very much to do with
the direction of the         currents     (see   paragraph 222 of Le Vitiaz                 et
 rOc/'an pacifique).         In    the      vicinity     of   islands,    for    the    same
 reason,   the water follows        a   direction coinciding with the apparent
 movement of the         sun.     It   is for this reason         also that the water
alongside      the    Chinese      coast      flows     to   the    south    during       the
 north-easterly       monsoon      as     well     as    during     the   south-westerly
 monsoon.       The Kuro-Siwo current going to the north and north
 east cannot    touch the Chinese coast because there is brackish water
 flowing to the south-west.
     Plates  IV., V., VI.,    and    VII.     show that in the Strait of Formosa
 the specific    gravity and temperature of the water at the Chinese
  coast are  quite different to what is observed off the coast of Formosa.
 This difference in the temperature              and specific     gravity may give to

      Fvery sailor knows how difficult                                   the passage           through the Strait
of Formosa is.                     During           the north-easterly monsoon                       the weather           is
very thick, and the depth of the                                         sea      cannot in these places                  be
regarded            as    giving a good means for determining the position                                                 of
the ship.                It   may happen that after                           a   ship leaves say Nagasaki
the captain never                       knows his position until he runs on the                                 Chinese
coast and wrecks his ship.                                My opinion              is,   that   a   regular     tempera
ture service should be arranged                                from Turnabout Lighthouse                        ;   every
day        a   pilot boat should put to                        sea,   taking temperatures                 both going
out and returning,                        and the temperature                         of the water should                  be
wired to all Chinese and Japanese ports for the information                                                         of   the
captains.             By      these means many ships would be saved from danger.
      The currents in the Straits of La Perouse are very complicated.
Plate          VIII.      shows the distribution of the temperature of the surface
water.              There      is   a   very narrow and long strip of cold water,                                   which
li"s in the direction from                           N.W.      to     S.E.   ;    a     vessel crossing that strip
in    July        may have temperatures of 18°                             C,      then 5°, and again               16' or
1   iS°.       It   would take me too long to explain the source from                                            whence
the        cold      water comes, and why                           it   is    constantly there           ;    it   is    the
cause of fogs which                           render navigation in that place very                              difficult.
I    may briefly say that the                           Kuro-Siwo current partly                     enters the          Sea
of     Japan,            and the excess                  of water          escapes          partly      through           the
Strait of La Perouse into the Okotsk Sea.                                                   Due to the          rotation
of the earth the current turns to the south-east and flows                                                     alongside
the        Island of Yezo.                    This water            is   warm and dense, having                     much
salt in it.              The water of the Okotsk Sea — particularly in the                                       vicinity
of the Island of Saghalien —                              is   in summer also pretty warm,                          but    it
is   much           lighter than the water of the Kuro-Siwo, and thus                                               while

the denser water sinks down, the lighter water tries to rise on the
top of it.       The difference of level which is produced hereby brings
to the surface        the cold water of the               lower strata (for particulars
see paragraph         2G1   of my book Le Vitiaz et VOci-'tn paeiftqw).
     I studied    this Strait in 1887 and 1888, and published the results
of my study, but when              I   came to the Pacific again in 1895, as the
admiral      commanding the squadron,                   I  was very anxious to go to
the    Strait of La Perouse to re-investigate the currents,                       and   now
1 am     in possession of very valuable material on this subject,                     which
is almost     ready for publication.
     I do not propose       to take up more             of your time at present with
particulars      of these five straits.            Those who desire further informa
tion may refer to my book               Le Vitiaz      et V Ocean    paciji'jue, published
in the Russian          and French          languages,      and    also my book on the
Exchange        of Waters       between       Hie    Black    Sea   and Mediterranean.
I   only wish to remind           you what important information                   the ther
mometer and hydrometer                   can give in the          study of tho different
parts    of our so little-known            planet.      You know better than I, that
studies    in that direction ought                to be continued,       and no nation in
 the   world has been so liberal as England,                     which found means to
send out      for four              the
                                           " Challenger," with a scientific staff to
                          years
 explore the deep         sea.     But it is not always possible to find such
 means,     and it is advantageous                to associate    ordinary     seamen   with
that kind of work.             Scientific societies miglit contribute very much
 in discussing the data collected                by the ordinary seamen, and f wish
 now to refer to the manner of collecting data regarding the tem
 perature     of   the   superficial water.
     Up to the present time it has been the custom to publish only
 charts of the temperature               ;  I    find that this syhtem is not quite
 efficient ;     charts of temperature are very useful, but when                          the
 number of observations increases                   and one wishes        to publish a new
  chart    one    does not know            what value       to attach to the        previous
  chart, and has to do the same work over again.
      In my book Le Vitiaz                  et    V Ocean   pacifique    I   have   made    a
  particular study in this respect of the Northern Pacific Ocean, and
  I  collected    from the log books of Russian vessels all the informa
  tion that    I  could find.        I  divided the       sea  into  1°  squares and gave
  to each    ship one little column            ;   the following      table  is an example
  of the method adopted           : —

    The first line gives           the year    of observation      ; the second,        the
month;      the third, the date; the fourth, the name of the ship;                      the
fifth gives the number of observations of temperature in                        a given
square; the sixth line gives the minimum temperature,                      the seventh
gives the maximum, and                the eighth the mean.           The columns          of
each square      I  put in chronological order with regard to the month
ami the day, but neglecting the year.                  After every month         I   have
an extra column for the monthly                  mean, and as the mean of the
data may not correspond to the middle of the month,                      I  give in    the
ninth line the         mean     temperature reduced         to the middle of           the
month.
    Now, suppose         somebody         wishes to     add new       data   upon      the
temperature observed on some other ships, he will have all my in
formation      at    his disposal,      and certainly his conclusions           will     be
better than mine, because he will get the advantage                    of more    exten
sive information.          Suppose some one wishes to study the variations
of temperature        of water by certain periods of time, one year,                  five
years,   seven years,       or whatever it may be, he will also find                   the
necessary     information        in my tables.
    Sir -John Murray,          whom      I  am glad     to see present,      wished to
study the amplitude of the variation in the temperature of the                        sur
face waters,     which has doubtless          a great  influence upon the       organic
life in the ocean; he found in my tables very necessary informa
tion, which assisted him in arriving at some very useful conclusions,
published not long ago in the Geographical Journal.
    I will  bo very glad       if my tables of temperature can be discussed
here,   or in a separate          Commission, and that the Oceanographera
 would come to certain definite opinions with regard to the                    mode of
collecting the        information       about   the   temperature of the         surface
 water.     It  would be      a great    advantage    to knowledge to divide            the
study of the sea with regard to the temperature.                      Suppose     Russia
should take      < ikotsk   Sea, Behring Sea, or Sea of           Japan, Black Sea,

Indian     Ocean,      France takes South Pacific,            Sweden and Norway
 take   North      Sea,   Baltic Sea and the Arctic Sea.                Every      nation
should    extract the information in regard               to the temperature        from
ship's log books, put        it in   tables of approved description, and             send

it to the corresponding          nation   ;  this will give means to collect
enormous information.           The observations of every ship in           a  certain
square ought to be placed           on a separate     card,    lloxes containing
these cards, say for the        North Pacific, will     not occupy      more space
than can be found in a good-sized            bookcase.
    When    a  new journal      of  a  ship is received, temperatures           of sea
water observed      on board     that ship should be placed on the cards,
and the cards put in their corresponding place.                 In this way          we
shall, each   year, become       richer in the knowledge of the tempera
ture of the surface water, and no observation               will  be lost.      Every
observation    will   increase our knowledge of the          temperature        of sea
water.     It will   be a real pleasure to see that progress of knowledge,
and   if ever this     system    or any other system        be   accepted,      it will
help us to study many details,            which, up to the present time, are
unknown.        From     time to time,        eacli nation would        publish its
information for the use of scientists             and seamen of all nations.
   I  wish to draw your attention to one instrument of my design,
which   will  be   of great service in the study of the temperature of
the sea.     Direct    observations     of the temperature      even when taken
every hour do not show          the exact     limits of the different currents.
Ships    nowadays steam so quickly              that in one hour        they cover
sometimes     as    much as 20 miles.           The   direct observations          only
show that the limit of the current was somewhere                 between      the two
places of observation, but they do not show whether the dividing
line is sharp or not.        In the   case of the Strait of    La   Perouse      a ship
might pass the cold region without noticing it at all.                     In   one of
the log books from which            I  extracted the temperature          of the    sea,
I  found recorded temperatures              of about   15°,  then 5°, and then
 again 15°, evidently       at that time the reading of           5°   was taken at
 the very place      of the strip of cold water.          Somebody examining
 the journal afterwards        added     10 to the 5 making        it  15,  probably
 thinking that the men who made the observations were in error,
 while  he  (the corrector) really made the mistake himself.
    The self-recording instruments are very important for studying
 the temperature        of the   sea,   and on Plato      IX. I      show    you the
 arrangement     I  proposed    for that purpose.       When     the ship is under
 way, water enters       into one part of the cock, washes round to the
 thermometer,      and returns to the sea, thus keeping the thermometer

instruments.
     The       part of the earth least                               known         is the Arctic Sea,                   and
information            about             the       temperature and specific                        gravity of the
water         in that part of                       the        world          would      be    very     interesting.
It   is long ago since                     I       had a great            desire      to penetrate           into this
region with            the hydrometer and thermometer in my hand, but
means which                I    think          are the best               adapted          for the purpose               are
very         expensive.           To collect                   the       necessary         funds      is sometimes
almost impossible.                         There              ought       to     be    a      pretext       that    some
influential persons should approve, and without                                                good pretext             it   is
impossible to find money.                                     When Dr Nansen —                     whose      personal
acquaintance           I   made after his journey across Greenland —conceived
the idea of penetrating into the                                  Arctic with his " Fram,"                     I    wrote
him      a    letter in which                  I    stated      that      I   was entirely of his opinion,
that he would be carried by the currents somewhere in the direction
he imagined, and advised him that help should be sent for                                                          liim to
Franz Josef Land                     ;    my letter to him and his answer were duly
published          in          the        Russian              newspapers             and      the Geographical
Proceedings.
     I   thought it quite possible that he would not fulfil his voyage in
three years        ;       I    also       thought that                  if in four           years    nothing was
heard of him, people would be anxious to send help, and that
would be         a good          pretext for collecting necessary                                money.            In    my
opinion the best way to penetrate into the Arctic region is by means
of a large ice-breaker.                            Certainly         I   did not wish to mention in my
letter to       Dr Nansen that                       I    would go and help him, because being
on a Government                          Service          I    could not dispose               of myself, but                 I
asked him in my letter,                              if       he had any intention                 to leave         some
trace of his voyage                  ;    he then answered                     me that he intended to put
on every island that he                                   might discover,              a    pole with          a    smsdl
Norwegian flag on                    it,   and under that pole                    a   letter with information
about the voyage of his ship.
     Fortunately for Dr Xansen the current carried him on very well.

and on my return from the Pacific Station,                    I  was happy to learn
that he and his       "  Fram

                                    had safely returned home.              Of course,
that deprived me of my pretext for collecting the necessary money
for building      a large    ice-breaker,       but   I   found another motive —
this time purely commercial.
    You know that       the   Gulf of Finland of          the Baltic Sea is covered
with   ice during the whole            winter, and that the navigation and
transport of cargo to such             an    important      commercial port       as  St
Petersburg is interrupted for five months in the year.                    In   a severe
winter     ice may be       found at a distance             of 200 miles from St
Petersburg.       The ice of the Finnish Gulf is very strong because
the water of the Baltic has very little salt in it.                 The thickness of
plain ice does not exceed two feet in                 deep places,     and three feet
in shallow water, but the winds break                 the ice and pile     it  up, and
large fields of packed         ice 12 feet deep may often be found.                  An
ice-breaker ought to be strong enough                   to go through ice of this
description.
   The first ice-breaker was built by              a  Russian merchant, Britneff,
 who took one of his steam tugs and cut the fore part into such                        a
shape that it would run on the top of the ice and break it with its
own    weight.      The    trial    took     place   in    1864    and proved very
successful,    and then the authorities of the city of Hamburg and
some    important     ports of the Baltic            constructed ice-breakers for
 themselves on the same principle, which prevails up to this day.
    A great    improvement in ice-breakers               was made     in America by
introducing      a fore propeller.         I   am sorry      to say that     I  do not
know the      name of the inventor            of the fore propeller, but it adds
considerably to the efficiency          of the ice-breaker.        The fore propeller
sucks the water from under the ice, and washes the skin of the
ice-breaker, delivering it from the pieces of ice which otherwise
would stop the progress of the ship. Anyhow, if it happens that
the ice " torros " is very powerful and stops the ice-breaker, then
the fore propeller is reversed,             and the water pushes forward the
pieces    of ice that compose that             "torros."       Plate X. shows how
this is    done.    One minute of such working of the propeller is
                                      "          "
usually enough to shake the torros ; after this the engine is again
reversed to speed ahead          (stern engine always working ahead), and
then the ship proceeds.            The ice-breakers in America are used on

404           Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinhurgh.                   [sess.
the large lakes, and the most         powerful     of them     (" St Maria ")    has
two engines,      both developing about 3,500 horse-power, the fore
engine being a trifle less powerful than the stern one.
   I  thought, however, that it would not be sufficient to break the
ice only to     St Petersburg.       My country        is barricaded by the ice
almost from everywhere.           If  you look at the chart of the Arctic
Ocean    (Plate XI.), you will        see   that the front of my country is
turned    to   the   Arctic   Sea,   but     that   Arctic    Sea    is constantly
covered    with ice.      Almost   all large Siberian rivers flow into the
Arctic    Sea,   the   ice of which     barricades the way and does               not
allow of    a  regular sea navigation to these Siberian rivers.                 Any
how, navigation was tried for many years, and in the month of
August one may hope to pass safely through the Arctic Sea to the
rivers Obi and Yenesei, but it is too irregular            a route for commerce,
 and for this reason the transport of goods by this way is very
 expensive.      We   have other expensive         means     of transporting our
 goods  to    Siberia;    what we really        want     is a cheap      method of
 communication, because the goods that we export are cheap                       and
 cannot stand a high tariff.
    The only means of making navigation                  to the    Siberian   rivers
 cheap is the ice-breaker, and        if it   becomes possible      to make navi
 gation to the Siberian rivers sure during three or three and a half
 months    a year,   then it will be business-like and the tariff will go
 down,  so   that it will be possible to export our cheap goods, such               as
 wheat and wood, which are found in Siberia in great quantities,
 and at  a cheap price.
    The question is whether ice-breakers              can deal with       the ice   of
 the  Kara    Sea.    I  do not possess exact data about the thickness of
 the ice in     the  Kara    Sea, but one can estimate           its thickness by
 theoretical    calculations.    We know          the    winter   temperature       at
 Xovaia Zemlya, North Coast of Siberia, and also the temperature
 observed during the Dutch Expedition              of 1882.      All   these figures
 show that the quantity of degree days of frost may be estimated
 yearly  as   being a little over 4000 Centigrade.              Weyprecht      in his
 book gives the relation between the quantity of frost in a given
 place  and the thickness of plain ice; 4000 degree days of frost
 give by his tables a thickness of ice corresponding to 5 feet, and

Petlikaie in the Arctic                    Sea,         also records          a   thickness of          5       feet.
The ice of the               Kara     Sea usually           melts       every summer,             so that the
Kara Sea is filled in winter with                                one year's         ice.        Ice of many
years' duration is found in the                           Kara   Sea only occasionally.
      Mr Afonasieff, who                 is well known              in English           literature by his
formulae on the resistance                         of ships, has worked out for me a very
simple formula for determining the relation between                                              thickness of
ice and the         power of the engines required to drive the ship through
it.    By this formula 10,000 horse-power                               is    required to drive             a   ship
through five feet of ice with                      a    speed of    1    to   2   knots.
      One to two knots              is   not   a   business      speed, but        it   is   not intended to
navigate iu the                 Kara     Sea       in winter time.                The mouths of the
Siberian         rivers, Obi and Yenesei, are not clear from ice before the
       of June, and                       no use to go with                       cargo to these            rivers
end
                                 it
                                 is                                          a
before the river steamers                       can       come     to the         mouth and take tho
cargo.          By that time the sun will affect very much the ice of the
Kara Sea, and surely the ice will not be                                 as    strong      as   in the winter
time, and           that will allow                the.   ice-breaker to proceed                  at   a    much
higher          speed.       In many            places      the     Kara          Sea    would         be     open
already          by the middle of June, and that would again be to tho
advantage of the speed of the ice-breaker.
      Certainly, the Kara Sea                      is   not only covered with plain ice, but
also    with pack ice, which maybe of considerable                                      thickness, but the
effect of the sun and the under current                                   will probably            take off          a
certain part of the strength of that pack ice.                                          Tho most difficult
places are probably not far from the mouths of the Siberian rivers,
and perhaps               the   greatest        difficulty will be found there.                         2so      one
knows how this ice                  is   packed, and          it   is   only by trial that one can
inform          himself upon this complicated phenomenon.                                         It will       be   a
very great success for the ice-breaker                                        can come          to tho mouths
                                                                   if
                                                                   it
of the rivers at the timo when they are just                                       opening,       but   if       this
should prove,              at the end of        June, beyond the power of                               tho ice
breaker, anyhow                 the    ice-breaker will be able to reach the                            mouths
of the Siberian rivers before any other ship can venture to do so.
      It   is   not enough that the ice-breaker should be able to force                                           it
self through          the ice, but         it   is      necessary       that the ice-breaker should
leave       behind       a   channel through which an ordinary cargo steamer
can pass        ;   the      channel may be filled with the detached pieces of

406             Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                 [sks*.
ice,  but this would          not obstruct the steamer          following.    "With
regard to this, a large ice-breaker is preferable to a small one, as
the large      ice-breaker leaves a larger channel and destroys the ice
more efficiently on its passage.
    Holding      the above-mentioned views,          I  opened    my ice-breaking
campaign by addressing the Geographical Society of St Petersburg
in  the month of March 1887.            I proposed     to build an ice-breaker     of
10,000 horse-power          with four   engines of equal size, three of them
being placed at the stern and the fourth at the bow of the ship.
The     lecture interested many people            in   the   subject.     Professor
Mendeleeff, who is well known in England, was first to join me.                 The
Minister of Finance of my country, Mr Witte, took a great interest
in my proposition, and said to me that if my ideas were correct, and
if really   the ice-breakers     could deal with Finnish Gulf and Kara Sea
ice, then they would be of great service to the commerce of Russia.
On his suggestion        I made   a voyage  to the Kara Sea, and on my return
the question was studied by the Commission, and               it was on the repre
sentation of the Minister of Finance that His Majesty the Emperor
of Russia         authorised    one   experimental      ice-breaker to be       con
structed.
    Several shipbuilding         firms were invited to tender, and that of
 Messrs    Sir W. G. Armstrong,            Whitworth it Company, Limited,
 which     promised better conditions, was accepted.                 It is  a  strik
ing    fact that the first        steam   tug that Britneff turned into            an
ice-breaker was built at the same yard somo                      forty years    ago.
 Lately, the same firm was engaged in building several ice-breakors
 for the River Volga, the Port of Hango, and the Lake of Baikal,
and   I  may state that they have done their best to fulfil the very
extraordinary        conditions that     I  have put upon them, which           were
 necessary     in building    a polar ice-breaker.
    I will not     take up much of your time in the technical details               of
the ship     ; the model     here exposed (Plate       XII.)  shows the exterior.
You will      notice that the submerged        part has no vertical lines, even
 in the midship       section   there is an angle of 20° from the vertical
line, and her bow and stern lines are inclined               70° and 65° respec
 tively from the vertical line.
    The ship has       a  double bottom and wing passages throughout the
 whole length.         Transversely, the ship is divided by eight principal

1898-99.]    Admiral Makaroff on Oceanographic Problems.                                    407
bulkheads, and the total number of independent compartments is
forty-eight.
    The sub-division of the ship is not a novelty in the science of
naval architecture.         The novelty is that each one of her compart
ments was filled with water to the upper deck                         ;   the compartments
which do not rise so high were tested with a pressure                            of water up
to the upper deck.         After the         engines,       boilers, doors,       pipes, etc.,
were fixed in their places, the largest compartment of the vessel was
again filled with water to the upper deck, so                    as       to ensure   that the
attaching of these things did not compromise                              the water-tightness
of the bulkheads.         The last trial was as successful                   as the previous
ones, and    if such    a severe test were        prescribed in the case of every
iron ship, the number of          casualties      would greatly decrease.                   It   is
a   shameful     thing     that    the large         liners     carrying thousands of
passengers are built      in    such       a way that a         little hole in them is
sufficient to settle them to the bottom.                    The loss of the           " Elbe,"
" Utopia," and " La Bourgogne," with                    a   great many passengers, is
a sufficient testimony that            I   am perfectly         right on insisting that
snips' bulkheads ought to be properly tried before                             the ships are
allowed to go to sea.
    However, this is not the main topic of my address.                            I may here
briefly state that the ribs of the ice-breaker and her skin are calcu
lated to bear the greatest pressure that ice can force upon it.                             The
ice-breaker can charge          at any floating ice (icebergs                   excluded) at
any speed going ahead or astern.
    There    are trimming        and heeling tanks of great capacity, and
there is a   pump in      the centre        of the ship which is able to force the
water from one extreme end                    of the ship to the other with                      a
velocity of 10 to 13 tons per minute.                        The hot water from the
condenser      may be utilized for warming the fore part of the ship in
order to make the surface of the ice-breaker more slippery                             ;    snow
at a low temperature washed with water at the freezing-point is
very sticky,      and    the warm skin of the ship, melting the                             very
surface     which touches       it,    will produce         a   sort of lubrication.
    In order to    have    means for navigating economically every main
engine can be disconnected from its propeller, and each propeller
may be turned           by special auxiliary            engines           provided    for    this
purpose.       The ship    is   fitted with      a   mast and             lifting crow's    nest,

408           Proceedings        of Royal Society of Edinbiurgh.                   [ses.
which allows of always keeping a.Jpok-out from                     a   height   of   100
feet in order to find the best way through the              ice".
     The ice-breaker is now almost           ready to go to the Baltic and to
commence       her work.
     Doubtless you wish to question mo             as to  whether with this ship
I   propose to proceed        to the   North Pole.       To this question        I  m?y
answer, that       in my first proposition            I  imagined it would be
necessary     to have two such          ships to go into the middle             of    the
Arctic Ocean;         we have now built          one, and the        trial of   it will
show how much the ice-breaker can do in the polar ice,                         which    I
shall try to negotiate if circumstances permit.
     The Arctic Sea in summer is certainly full of ice, but this ice is
in the shape of islands, divided by the canals                    which are mostly
 filled with     broken     ice.     The islands are of different sizes, some
 being as   much   as five miles in diameter        ; the others are smaller,        an  1
 the great majority of them do not exceed hundreds of feet.                      Some
 times these islands are pressed            against   each other, and       there    may
 be days during which           it is difficult  to proceed, but with a change
 of weather and current the ice islands may become separated from
 e;ich other so as to render a passage possible.              I   do not   think that
 going     with the ice-breaker into the            Polar Region it would hi
 necessary    to keep a straight course and cut the ice              ;  1 believe that
 the ship should go       in   a  "zig-zag" line, shaping her course between
 ice-floes.     In some cases it will be necessary to apply the full
 power, but in other places the ship will proceed easily.
      I spoke on this subject with Captain Sverdrup of the " Frani "
 and    Dr Xansen.       Captain Sverdrup is entirely of my opinion, but
  1 >r  Xansen did not wish to express             his views;     he only     said that
 he wished me success,            and he would be the first to congratulate
 me upon it.
     The near future will show whether my proposition and calcula
 tions are sound or not.

     I. Notes on thb Sounding Cruise                      op S.S.   'Britannia,'
                                by R. E. Peake.
    The following is a brief account of the principal points of interest
resulting from the survey lately made to find a suitable route for
a cable to     be    laid from      Bermuda       to    Turk's    Islands and from
thence to Jamaica.
    As   engineers    to  the    Direct West        India Cable Co., my firm,
Messrs Clark, Forde, & Taylor, strongly advised                    that  a more    than
usually complete set of soundings should be taken along the route
over which       it  was   proposed       that the cable should be laid, our
principal reason being that,         as    the Bermuda group has been raised
almost vertically from the bed of the Atlantic by volcanic action,
it  was impossible,       with    the limited information           available,  to say
¦whether    similar action might not have taken place elsewhere on
the proposed       route for the new cable.
    The task of carrying out this survey was undertaken by the
Telegraph      Construction         and     Maintenance        Co.   with    their   s.s.
 *
   Britannia,' which was fitted up with all necessary apparatus, and
 was also well adapted for the work.
    Sounding operations were commenced                    off Grand Turk Island on
 the    4th November 1897, and completed                     on the 2nd     December
 following    at    Bermuda, during which               time   182    soundings were
 taken, apart from the            profile soundings taken off Grand Turk.
The laying of the cable was commenced at Bermuda on the 5th
January 1898, and completed on the 18th of the same month.
    As a result of this work the following suggest themselves as
 points worthy of notice        : —
     VOL.  XXII.         15/3/99                                           2 D

410            Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                    [sbss.
    (1) The even slope of the ground from the neighbourhood of
Bermuda to the deepest water found in Lat. 24° 50' N., no indica
tion being discovered         of any upheaval similar to that which has
produced the Bermudas with their adjoining shoals.
    (2) The large extent of water with depths of over 3000 fathoms.
    (3) Sounding No. 91. The undoubted evidence of a hard
bottom or hard object in such               a great  depth    as   2994   fathoms      ;
in   this    case  the   instrument       for  obtaining    a  specimen      of   the
bottom,     known    as a  "snapper,"       was brought up dented and bent,
with a small portion of calcareous substance enclosed in the jaws.
    (4) The formation of the coral bank on the west side of Grand
Turk Island, as shown by the profile soundings taken off that
island.
    (5) That the south rocks near Sand Cay in the Turk's Island
Passage are placed about £ mile too far south on Chart 1441.
   (6) That at its southern end the Turk's Island Passage is
blocked by a bank which joins the Turk's Islands to the Caicos,
having     a   comparatively narrow ridge, with between              200 and 300
fathoms of water on it.            This bank,    especially   on its south side,
shows     a very steep gradient into deep water.
    (7) That the cable between Bermuda and Grand Turk Island
lies in by far the deepest water of any cable laid up to the present
time,   not only in the maximum depth attained,                   but also in the
average depth of the whole section.              The deepest water obtained
on the route of the cable was 3113 fathoms, and the mean                      depth
from Cable House to Cable House 2732 fathoms.                     In   one continu
ous run of twenty-four          hours, during which       172 nautical miles        of
cable were paid out, the average depth was 3044 fathoms.
    A further point of interest        is the comparison of the mean bottom
temperature       derived from        thermometer     observations with          that
obtained by electrical         tests of the laid cable.          Along the route
followed by the cable over           a distance  of 750 miles, 102 soundings
were    taken, at a considerable          number of which the bottom tem
perature      was observed.       It  was possible,    therefore,    to determine,
with considerable       accuracy,    the mean depth and mean temperature
by thermometer.

     Note. — To obtain the mean thermometer temperature, the lengths
 in the first column were multiplied by the corresponding tempera
 tures in the third column, and the sum of the products divided by
 the total length.
     It will be seen from the previous statement that the short length
 of shallow water at       each end of the line is only sufficient to raise
  the mean temperature one-third of           a degree    above the minimum

 412         Proceedings        of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
obtained, viz., 360-2 Fahrenheit,          and as this temperature           appears
to be    practically     the   same for   all depths exceeding,           say, 2300
fathoms, the conditions are exceptionally             favourable for comparing
the mean     temperature given by thermometer with that                     obtained
from electrical observations on the laid cable.
   Owing    to   the    small and steady difference of earth               potential
between Bermuda and Turk's Islands                 it was possible to determine
the copper resistance         of the laid cable       with great accuracy,        and
the results so obtained were further            checked by comparison with
standard coils.
   The copper      resistance    at 75° of the different coils of core used in
the manufacture         of the cable was separately determined by                  the
contractors and by ourselves with different                 instruments,      and   as
very little difference was          found   between       these    results there     is
every reason      to believe that the electrical          values are accurate.
   The application of Matthiessen's co-efficient for the resistance                  of
copper at different temperatures, to the observed resistance                   of  the
laid cable, gave     a mean temperature of 33°'3 Fahrenheit,               while   the
mean    observed temperature by thermometer was 36°-5 Fahrenheit.
It  appeared to us at first that this discrepancy must be due to                    an
error in the thermometer values, but after reading Professor Tait's
                                                '                '

and having had the instruments             used    on the      Britannia     verified
at  Kew, this did not        seem possible.       The only other       explanation
which occurred to us was that the temperature co-elficient of                      the
copper used in the conductor was different to that hitherto                       em
ployed in calculation, and it was accordingly              docided to investigate
this point experimentally.
   A determination of the co-efficient was carried out with great
care by Mr H. A. Taylor, who, through the courtesy of Mr W.
Shuter, the Managing          Director of the Telegraph Construction              and
Maintenance Co., was enabled to test samples of wire supplied by
five of the leading manufacturers.           The results obtained from          these
tests, which     gave    singularly even values for the different samples,
showed that the temperature co-efficient for this class of copper                  was
sensibly different from that obtained by Matthiessen, and the new
co-efficient applied       to the    observed resistance of the laid             cable

  1898-99.]       Soundings    obtained by      s.s.   Britannia?               413
 gave a mean temperature         of 36°-26 against 36°-57 by thermometer.
 These results are    so close as to  practically reconcile the two methods
 and confirm the accuracy of both.
     The alteration     in this co-efficient has certainly occurred only
 within    the last few years, and is probably due to changes                in the
 methods employed in the manufacture.                  All  conductivity     copper
 is now electrically deposited,      and owing to improved processes the
 density     of   the metal is appreciably           higher    than    that of the
 laboratory specimens on which Dr Matthiessen's observations were
 made.      Increased density is accompanied by higher conductivity,
 and Matthiessen himself pointed out that under these circumstances
 an increased temperature co-efficient was to be expected.*

                      by Sir    John Murray, K.C.B.
     In  November and December 1897, the s.s.             '
                                                            Britannia,' belonging
 to the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Co., took an excel
 lent series of soundings between Bermuda and Turk's Islands and
 thence through the Windward Passage to Jamaica, t Through the
 kindness of     Mr R. E. Peake, M.Iust.C.E., who supervised              the carry
ing out    of the work on behalf of the Direct "West              India Cable Co.,
 we have been permitted to examine                the deposits      brought home,
 numbering in all 116 samples, ranging in depth from 224 to 3150
 fathoms.       These samples may be arranged in zones of 500 fathoms
as   follows: —

    In thejmajority of      cases the samples          are small, especially from
very deep water, where,             however, the available material shows
that the      bottom is covered         by Red Clay extremely uniform               in
character and composition           ;  some of the samples         weighed from      a
half to one ounce, and in a few cases even more.                   All  the samples,
large   and small, were        carefully       examined, and in nearly every
case the     type of deposit       was determined.          In   the^ case   of large
samples     the   percentage     of carbonate       of lime was determined by
chemical analysis, and in other cases it was estimated                     by inspec
tion.    Typical examples,        where there was sufficient material, have
been    fully   described,   and      the   descriptions will be found in the
sequel.
    Before    proceeding     to    consider the general character of the
bottom, we may point out that this admirable series of soundings
has considerably increased          our knowledge of the depth of the              sea
in this part of the world.            The line of deep soundings has altered
 the   outlines    and increased         the   extent of the area over 3000
 fathoms (called Nares Deep on the bathymetrical charts published
 in the ' Summary of Results,' forming the final two volumes of the
  Challenger Reports, 1895),          which now approaches           much closer to
 the coast of Turk's Islands.             The area over 2000 fathoms is also
 extended towards the northern entrance of the Windward Channel,
 between Caicos Bank and Haiti.                 The present      state of our know
 ledge of the depths and deposits in this region of the ocean is shown
 on the accompanying map.
    The deposit      samples     show that in shallow           water close to the
 shore of Jamaica       the bottom is covered            by Blue Mud, containing
  20 or 25 per cent, of carbonate             of lime.     Off the   eastern point of
  Jamaica the deposit passes into Pteropod Ooze, containing 60 to 80

  per cent, of carbonate         of lime, which continues through the Wind
 ward Passage          in depths down         to 1800        fathoms, but is replaced
 again in deep water (over 2000 fathoms), between the north
 ern coast of Haiti and Caicos Bank, by Blue Mud, containing
 5  or 10 per cent, of carbonate              of lime.        A very peculiar       sample
 comes from this locality,            containing an extraordinary              proportion
 of volcanic mineral particles, and therefore called a Volcanic Mud
 (see description          of No. 49, 2293 fathoms).              On approaching the
 southern entrance of Turk's Island Passage, in the neighbourhood
 of a reported danger called Fawn                Shoal, which was unsuccessfully
 searched      for in 1880 by H.M.S.           '
                                                 Fantome,'        Pteropod     Ooze, with
 about 90 per cent, of carbonate             of lime, again covers the bottom in
 depths between 250              and 300      fathoms.         The four      samples      are
 peculiar in that they contain internal casts of Foraminifera,                       Ptero-
 pods, and other organisms,            these casts being composed of carbonate
 of lime, and not of a silicate            as is   usually the case       ; similar casts
                                                                       '               '
 were observed           in the deposit collected by the                 Challenger       off
 Raine      Island     in Torres      Strait   (see detailed description further
 on).    Off Turk's Islands          the deposit is Coral Mud             or Sand, with
 80 to 90 per cent, of carbonate               of lime, in depths less than 1000
 fathoms.        From the steep slope to the north of Turk's Island, in
depths between            1000 and     2000 fathoms, no deposit-samples                were
brought home         ;    but in depths slightly over 2000 fathoms Globi-
gerina Ooze, with 60 to 70 per cent, of carbonate                     of lime, was met
with, succeeded by Red Clay containing about                        3 to 15 per cent,      of
carbonate       of lime in depths approaching                    and exceeding        3000
fathoms, which             continues until the bottom gradually                 shoals    on
approaching Bermuda,              the percentage          of carbonate       of lime in
creasing to 20 and 25 per cent.,                  the deposit insensibly           passing
into Globigerina Ooze with from 30 to 70 per cent, of carbonate
of lime in depths between 2162 and 2562 fathoms, with Ptero
pod Ooze, containing 80              or 85     per cent,       of carbonate      of lime,
nearer the shores of Bermuda in 1000 and 1395 fathoms.
    This   series of soundings modifies somewhat the                     distribution      of
deep-sea       deposits      as  laid    down      in this region         on   the    chart
accompanying            the   Challenger       Report         on   Deep-Sea Deposits,
published in 1891.            Thus:—

416           Proceedings   of Royal Society of Edinburgh.           [sess.
   (1) Blue Mud is introduced off the coasts of Jamaica and Haiti.
   (2) Pteropod Ooze is introduced northward from Jamaica
            through the Windward Channel,         again  off the southern
            entrance of Turk's Island Passage,       and again near the
            island of Bermuda at the northern end of the series.
   (3) Coral deposits are introduced off Turk's Islands; and
   (4) The deep-water Red Clay area is extended and approaches
            closer to the coast of Turk's   Islands than shown on the
            map referred to.
   In  the following   table we have collected together the informa
tion regarding this series of deposits,      giving the number, date,
position, depth, type of deposit, estimated      percentage   of carbonate
of lime,   with   a  few remarks on     the  varying    character of    the

   In this and      the three neighbouring deposits (254 to 290 fathoms)
casts of the calcareous         organisms in carbonate             of lime occurred.
Such     a deposition      was observed        in  the    deposit obtained by the
'                 '
  Challenger        off Raine Island,       Torres Strait (155 fathoms), and
is thus described       in the Challenger        Report on Deep-Sea Deposits
(pp. 169-170) :—
    " If some of the Foraminifera             be treated      with dilute acid, the
action stopped after it has continued for some time, and the sub
stance dried and examined by reflected                light, a number of casts of
the organisms       are seen  in  carbonate     of lime looking quite like milky
quartz.       If, however,   the action be continued,           it  is seen that they
are    composed      of carbonate of lime as they                entirely disappear,
leaving a small residue of         a  reddish colour, or very areolar casts of
the shells     in the  same red substance.           Examined       in thin sections,
it is observed that the shells           are filled      with a red, yellowish,      or
greenish matter, frequently             extending       into the      foramina.    The
shell is at once distinguished from the cast by its structure, trans
parency, and optical properties.             It  is sometimes observed        that two
or three shells or fragments are cemented                   by the same red sub
stance forming the casts.          This    substance,      when sufficiently trans
parent,     appears    of a yellowish       red colour, and gives           sometimes
aggregate      polarisation, but is never extinguished               between crossed
nicols.      Often    the   casts   inclose small mineral particles.             With
very high powers it is seen that the structure of the grey carbonate
of lime casts is granular, and between crossed                 nicols it is evident
that the grains are crystalline.           This is    one of the few instances       in
which it has been possible to point out the deposition of carbonate
of lime in the shells forming deposits, and it evidently took place
in  the deeper layers."

    From an inspection of the two samples                     sent us by      Mr Peake
{one wet, one dry), it is impossible to say whether there were two
layers at the bottom, and, if             so,  whether the yellow ooze or the
green sandy material formed the upper layer                     ; the yellow material
occurs in small patches           surrounded by the sandy material.                    It is
probable that the bottom was originally                     covered     by Globigerina
Ooze, and that subsequently a submarine eruption took place, the
volcanic mineral matter resulting therefrom being brought up mixed
with   the ooze in such abundance that the deposit                    must be called       a
Volcanic Mud.          The volcanic debris is apparently not widespread,
for  the neighbouring deposits are Blue Muds in similar depths to the
north-east, and Pteropod Oozes in shallower depths to the south-east.

   The following        extract is quoted from the Sounding Report by
Mr Peake to draw attention to undoubted                    evidence  of   a hard
substance     on  the      bottom at this great depth : — " New snapper
came up dented and bent, so that               it would not    close  properly     ;
small specimen of rocky substance           in neck of snapper."
   The material consists of one or two small calcareous fragments,
too minute to determine accurately, though they appear                 to be of
organic origin.       The fragments were submitted by           Mr Peake to an
expert in the British Museum, who writes              :
                                                        " Small granules com
posed of calcite    ;   it  is scarcely possible to determine the source of
such small particles, — whether of organic or purely mineral origin."

                    DESCRIPTION OF THE MAP.
    The   map accompanying this paper          represents the present      state
of our knowledge concerning the marine deposits in the south
western portion of the North Atlantic. The various kinds of
deposits are shown in different colours, but it must be remembered
that each variety of deposit slowly passes into adjacent varieties
without any marked line of separation such              as the colours on the
map tend to suggest.         It  is often difficult   to say whether a given
sample should be called a Red              Clay    or a Globigerina     Ooze,  a

 Volcanic Mud, although typical          samples of each of these varieties

   The Bermudas, which          are situated towards the north east corner
 of the map, consist of a number of coral islets which crown the

 summit of          a   huge    cone      rising    abruptly        from the     bed of       the
 Atlantic,      the islands being surrounded                    at   no great distance         by
depths of over 2500 fathoms.                     This   cone, on which the           Bermudas
are situated, was          originally — there        is  little doubt — a volcano.            Xo
trace of volcanic rock has as yet, however, been dredged                               from    its
slopes    ;  it  is now completely covered                by a mantle of carbonate              of
lime — the broken shells and skeletons of marine organisms.                                     It
 will   be noticed that four colours surround                         the   Bermudas.        The
inner colour (yellow) shows                   the coral reefs and Coral Sands                and
Muds.          Outside these,          the Coral        Mud      passes into      a   Pteropod
Ooze (pale green colour) with                  increasing depth and distance from
the islands.          Though only shown in one small patch to the east of
Bermuda, future investigations will probably show that Pteropod
Ooze     occurs      all round the cone in depths of about 800 to 1400
fathoms.          Beyond the depth of about 1400 fathoms, the Pteropod
Ooze passes into a Globigerina Ooze (pink colour), and,                         with increase
of depth, the quantity of carbonate                       of lime shells and skeletons
becomes       less and less         till the Globigerina            Ooze    passes, at depths
between       2700 and 3000           fathoms,     into a Red Clay (brown colour),
in which deposits            in the greater depths there may be scarcely a
trace of the carbonate            of lime shells.
    It  will    be observed        that the Red Clay occupies                  all the   deeper
parts of the bed of the ocean in this region, and covers the greater
part of the area represented                 by the map.           In  passing   towards the
shallower         depths,     in the       direction    of the coasts of the             United
States      and the West Indies,                it will     be noticed       that   a  band of
Globigerina Ooze (pink colour) occupies the bed of the ocean from a.
depth of about 2100 fathoms up to 500 or 600 fathoms, the deposit
varying much in composition according to depth and position.
    The deposits          close    to land,       and generally          within    the 500 or
 600     fathoms-line,         show       great     variety      dependent       on     position
and the        nature of the adjacent land.                     Off    the coast of     Florida,
just beyond         the 100 fathoms-line, there                is a deposit of glauconitic
sand     and mud (dark green colour), containing generally about 50
 per  cent,    of carbonate of lime.               In this deposit some remarkable
phosphatic concretions have been found,* and similar phosphatic

being fragments of Manatee bones.
    Around all coral reefs the deposit consists                 of Coral Sands and
Muds (yellow colour).            At    some distance        from the reefs, and at
greater depths, the coral deposits            pass into a Pteropod         Ooze (pale
green colour), and in some cases it is impossible to say whether the
sample should be called         a  Coral Mud or a Pteropod Ooze.                Where
rivers enter the      sea,   and generally off coasts where rocks belonging
to ancient formations are exposed, the deposit is usually                      a   Blue
Mud (blue colour) principally             made up of land detritus.           In  some
places the quantity of volcanic detritus is so abundant                    as  to give
the deposit      the     character of "Volcanic          Mud, as in one         sample

Mississippi and other rivers, Blue Mud is found at                   a great distance
from land and in very            deep water.         In   the deepest water of the
Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, far removed from land, it
will   be observed        that the deposit again           passes into Globigerina
Ooze.
    It should be remarked that the limits of many of these deposits,
as laid down on the map,               especially    in shallow water, are to          a
large extent hypothetical, owing to the small number of deposits
wbich      have   been      carefully    examined       up to the      present    time.
Future investigations will          no doubt extend the limits            of some of
the    deposits    as    laid down on the map,                especially  as   regards
Globigerina      Ooze, Pteropod         Ooze, Coral      deposits,  Blue Mud, and,

The Energy of the R6ntgen Rays.                                           By Rev.     Alexander
        Moffat, M.A., B.Sc.                   (Communicated by               Dr C.   G. Knott.)
                                      (Read January 9, 1899.)
  The number of experiments that have been made on the Rontgen
rays is already very large, and much has been learned from them
regarding the properties of these rays.                               There has been, however, as
yet, but       little   done         to determine their energy.                 Indeed, the only
accurate       work which has been carried out in this direction is that
of E. Dorn (Wied.                    Ann., Bd. 63, p. 160), who measured the heat
produced by Rontgen rays falling on a metal plate.                                This investiga
tion    is,    however, not complete,                      as Dorn       did not determine             the
number         per second             or the duration                 of the discharges of the
Rontgen rays.
  On the suggestion                    of Professor E. Wiedemann                     (Erlangen),        in
whose laboratory           I        have    been working,         I      have tried to investigate
this subject            and, although                have       not had time to complete my
                                              I I

experiments,          as        now find             have to return to         India much earlier
than   I      expected, I I         shall describe the methods adopted                 and the re
sults obtained,            in   the hope that they may not be without                         interest.
 I      first sought to determine in absolute measure                             the quantity of
light produced on               a    screen      of barium platino-cyanide by Rontgen
rays.         For this      purpose     I     used an optical bank with                 the barium
platino-cyanide             screen         and    the Rontgen             lamp at one end,             the
source        of light which         I     used       as   a   standard of comparison at the
other         end, and between them                        a   movable photometer.            The ar
rangement of the apparatus                       is   shown in the following            diagram.
   The         Rontgen          lamp which            I        used    was   one supplied         by the
Voltohm-Elektricitats-Gesellschaft,                             A. G., Munich.           It    was      as
shown          in the second               diagram, the anti-cathode being                    a   copper
hemisphere with                 a   platinum disc for the plane face, set at an angle
of 45° to the axis of the lamp, and the vacuum being one suitable
for    a   short spark.                The radius of the bulb was 4-2 cm.                              The
 current was obtained from                       a    twenty-plate Tbpler machine, which

  189S-99.]   Eev. A. Moffat on Energy of the Rontgen Rays.                    431
  ¦was   driven by   a   hydraulic    motor made by A. Schmid of Zurich.
  I regulated the water supply         so that the motor ran at the rate         of
                                     E

  two revolutions     per second.       In order  to obtain as strong Rontgen
  rays as possible,    I  introduced an air-spark into the circuit.         It has
  been shown by      Dr A. Wehnelt and           others   that  a Rontgen lamp
 is the more efficient the more abruptly the discharge takes place,
  and   I  found this to be the case in my experiments.                  The dis
 charge in the air-spark was made          as disruptive   as possible  by blow
 ing   a  strong current of air through it.            This drives away the
 particles of dust in the air, and consequently makes the discharge
 more sudden.
    The Rontgen lamp, with its air-spark, was enclosed in a box with
 a wooden frame and sides of thick cardboard.               The lamp was fixed
 near one side of the box, and at the place where the rays from the
 anti-cathode were to be transmitted a hole             6 cm.  in diameter     was
 bored and covered with thin black paper.                On the other side of
this thin black        paper     the    barium   platino-cyanide     screen    was
-fastened.     In front of     the screen was     fixed  a piece   of cardboard

432              Proceedings         of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
with      a   small hole in   it,    and through this the light-emitting                    surface
of the screen appeared.                In order to          stop     the discharge          in the
llcintgen lamp when        I     wished       to do so without stopping the motor,
I   introduced      a    shunt, consisting of an air-spark, parallel to the
lamp.
     A    Hefner lamp was used                as   the standard of comparison.                  As
preliminary experiments showed that the light proceeding from the
barium platino-cyanide screen was very faint, the light coming from
the Hefner lamp had to be weakened                        considerably.            This   was done
by putting the lamp inside               a    wooden box, provided with tubes                   for
the entrance of fresh air and the escape of the combustion products.
A    hole was made in front of the box, and covered                           with translucent
paper         of as uniform texture as could be procured.                            In front of
this, again,       was put       a   piece of green         glass,    and     as    this did not
weaken the light enough, another piece of somewhat darker smoked
glass was put in front of it.            The Hefner lamp was placed sufficiently
far behind         the   paper      to secure      that    it   was practically uniformly
illuminated, and as in the             case    of the barium platino-cyanide screen,
a    piece     of cardboard with         a     small hole in         it   was set in front to
give the light-emitting              surface       a    convenient magnitude.
     In   the choice of the photometer to be employed,                      I      was restricted
by the very small luminosity to                    be    measured.        I   could not, there
fore, adopt either        Joly's paraffin photometer or the photometer of
                           Lummer         and          Brodhun.      I     used      simply    two
                           mirrors set at right angles to one another, and
                           in this way lost very little of the light.                       At the
                           barium platino-cyanide screen                      and    the    Hefner
                           lamp,     I   used apertures           of different sizes, vary
                           ing from      5    cm. to 1*5 cm. in diameter, in order
                           that the images seen in the photometer might
appear about the same size in whatever position on the optical bank
it   might happen to be.
     To determine the quantity of light emitted by the translucent
paper, which served as the source of                      light when illuminated by             the
Hefner lamp,       I     put at one end of the optical bank                   a     Hefner lamp,
and, at the other end, the box with the translucent paper thus
illuminated.         The photometer           I         now used was          that of E.        W.

uniformly        illuminated             surfaces,        which can be readily                       compared
when the sources of light are strong enough.                                          I    found that the
light emitted by            the paper was one-twentieth of that of the                                   Hefner
lamp.       I   then removed                the       paper,    and determined the extinction
coefficient of the green glass and the darker glass by measuring
the intensity of the light transmitted by them                                      in comparison with
that of the lamp alone.                     I   used four different pieces                     of dark glass
(A, B, C, D) in my experiments, and found that the intensity of
the light coming from the translucent paper, when weakened by
transmission       through the green glass, and one of these pieces of
dark glass was,

    When we seek to compare the energy of the Rtintgen rays with
that of light rays, we must determine how much energy is supplied
by them in         equal          times.         Now, the light of the Hefner                            lamp is
emitted during the whole time it is burning, but the Riintgen rays
only during very short intervals of                            time.          I   therefore tried to get
at least an upper limit to the duration of these intervals.                                                 This
I   did by putting in front of the                              barium            platino-cyanide screen
an opaque        screen          with a small vertical slit, and viewing the image
of the slit in          a        rotating       mirror.         The mirror was driven by                       a
centrifugal       machine, and the image viewed directly by the                                             eye.
Now,    since     the       barium platino-cyanide screen does not show any
appreciable phosphorescence,                          it follows that if            the emission          of the
Rontgen rays continues for a certain time, we should                                           see a broaden
ing of the image in the mirror.*                               Had there been              a   broadening of
one-tenth of the image, it could have been detected                                            ;   but no such
broadening was observed.                         Now, since the slit was                       3   mm.    broad,
and the mirror exactly opposite                           it    at a distance of 27 -5 cm., and
revolving at the rate of about ten revolutions per second, it follows
    *It is clear that, if the emission of light from the screen continued after
the Rontgen rays had ceased to fall upon                          it,
                                                   we could not use the above-
mentioned    method, as there would be       broadening of the image, owing to

that,   if the   image were      broadened      one-tenth part, the duration            of
the   radiation must have been about
                  h x  tV  x ttf * ?T~s  x tt = tiv.wbu      second.
   We     may, therefore, conclude that the duration                 of the Itiintgen
rays produced by each discharge cannot be greater                       than nnrViKr
second, and shall use this as an upper limit.
   This number         is less than any given by those              who       have   pre
viously determined the duration of the Rontgen rays.

who seems to have been the first to attempt to do this accurately,
used a     Ruhmkorff coil with          a rotating    interrupter        to make      and
break the current in the primary circuit.                  On the interrupter he
mounted a photographic plate, and in front of it had a screen of
lead   with   a slit in  it    The Rontgen rays passing through the slit
produced a photograph of it on the plate, which appeared broadened
into a small sector of a circle. From the amount of broadening,
Roiti concluded that the duration of                a  discharge was about
second.
   Dr E. Trouton (Report of               the   British Association, Liverpool,
 1896) adopted the method of rotating a zinc-toothed wheel between
the Rontgen lamp and the photographic plate.                        A photograph of
the moving teeth was obtained by making one interruption                          of the
primary current in the induction coil, and so allowing one discharge
to pass.      The departure from sharpness             of outline of the photo
graph of the teeth indicated the time that the radiation                          lasted.
The     results obtained in         this   way varied      from jr^j         to T^.Vinr
second.
    M. Colardeau (dZclairage           electrique,   vol.  viii.   p.   112),    using   a
similar method,       found the duration to be about            10100
                                                                         second.
   H. Morize        (Comptes      rendus,    vol.  cxxvii.   p. 546),       like Roiti,
makes      the photographic        plate   revolve    behind      a   slit in   a metal
screen.      The plate is fixed to one end of the axle of an electro
motor, and at the other end is a toothed wheel which interrupts
an electric current, and         makes    a contact which         registers itself      as
well   as the mean seconds of an electric chronometer on the band of                     a
Breguct chronograph.             He is thus able to determine the speed of
the motor at any moment.                From the broadening of the image of

the slit      he deduces          the duration of the emission of the Rontgen
rays, and gives as the mean result 0-00109 second.
   Now, with             reference      to all these       experiments, it has to be
observed          that they were           made    with induction       coils.         A   great
difficulty in the way of using               an induction coil for such an investi
gation is that, owing to the nature of the apparatus,                     each discharge
given by          a   coil lasts for a certain time.          This is not the          case,    or,
at least, is so to a very much less extent with influence machines.
The discharges from                these   machines being, because of the small
capacity,          practically instantaneous, experiments               conducted with
them give much clearer results.
   To    get the whole duration of the discharge of the Rontgen rays                            in
one second, we must multiply the duration of each discharge by the
number of discharges.                   The method adopted for determining                     the
number of discharges was that given long ago by Professor E. Wiede
mann (Wied. Ann., 10, p. 210).      In the circuit containing the
Rontgen lamp and its air-spark, the   length of the spark being 14
mm.,     a   Geissler tube        (H)   was set upright outside the box.               Parallel
to it was fixed another Geissler tube (N) excited by an induction
coil. The interruptions of the primary current in the coil were
made         by a vibrating         tuning-fork which made 100 vibrations per
second.           By viewing the         images of the Geissler tubes         in   a   rotating
mirror, one could easily determine the relation between the number
of discharges in the tube                   H and     those    in the tube N.*                 The
 number so obtained was about 90.                         The whole duration of the
emission of             the Rontgen         rays    is,   therefore,    not      more      than
90   x   TiriMFTny!      *-e->   loYo °*    *ine   whole time which elapses.

spark        is      shortened.
    In       these       experiments       I     have measured           the intensity of the rays
emitted by only one screen.                       I      shall take      it   to correspond to the
whole energy                 of the Riintgen rays, i.e., as                   if    the whole of the
Riintgen rays were absorbed by the barium platino-cyanide screen.
I   shall do this because                  I      found that when           I     put   a   second screen
before the first, its brightness was only one-eighth of that                                               of the
first.             The correction to be made for the Riintgen rays not trans
formed               into light by the first screen                  would thus be only 10 per
cent.,         a      number which            we       may     here      neglect,    as      being of the
order of the experimental errors.
    In order            to compare directly the intensity of the Riintgen radia
tion with that of the Hefner                           lamp, we must bear in mind that the
Riintgen              rays   come from the anti-cathode, and                            produce           a   lumi
nescence              that proceeds in         a      diffused way in all directions from the
luminescent screen.                       If, therefore,       the distance of the anti-cathode
from the screen                                       part of the screen gets an                     intensity

distance from the screen                     2    cm., so that the distance of the                             anti

cathode from the screen                was   6"2   cm.     If, then, the      screen    had
been at a distance of            1  cm. from the anti-cathode, the intensity of
the radiation would have been (6-2)2, i.e., 38-4 times                    the intensity
stated above, viz., 38"4 (4 x 10-*) = 154 x 10"4 Hefner lamp.
     If  we admit that the whole energy of the Rontgen rays                       is trans
formed into light energy, the intensity of the Rontgen rays would
be 154 x 10         ~4  Hefner lamp.        Now, the energy of the light emitted
by the Hefner lamp in one second                     is (H89 watt.        Therefore the
part of the energy             of the Rontgen rays transformed every second
into      luminescence        is 0*002911      watt.      Now,    we have     found that
 the     luminescence         lasts   for only TirVi7 °f ^ne wn°le time which
elapses.         If, then, the energy were emitted at the same rate dur
 ing    the whole time, we would              obtain for the energy of the lumi
 nescence        2-911      watts.    From     the    experiments      of Professor E.
 Wiedemann we know that the transformation coefficient                         of radiant
energy into          luminescence is not more               than    about   4   per   cent.
 ( Wied. Armed., Bd. 37, p. 233 ; Sitzungsber.                          d. phys. med.
  Gesellseh. zu Erlangen, 1888).               Assuming the same proportion to
 hold good for the transformation of the energy of Rontgen radiation
 into      luminescence,       we find that the        Rontgen rays producing the
 luminescence supply energy at the rate of 73 watts.                         This   energy
 corresponds to that of 18 gram-calories per                     sec.  Now     the energy
 of    the    sun's    rays falling    upon one square          centimetre is equal to
 that of      0-035 g. Cal. per sec, so that            if the Riintgen     rays   were to
 fall perpendicularly            on a square      centimetre, they would produce
  18-r0'035, i.e.,         500 times the effect        of the sun.      Something like
 the same conclusion is reached               if  we take     the result given by E.
 Dorn.         He finds, for the total radiation during one second,                     1*51
 mg. Cal.       (Wied. Ann., Bd.          63, p. 175).       Supposing, then, that the
 radiation here also lasts for -j^Vff second, we would get from his
 determination           the value      1-51   g.  Cal.    per second,     which nearly
  corresponds to that obtained by me.                     The energy     of the cathode
  rays is much greater than this, being, according to the determina
  tion of E. Wiedemann               and   H. Ebert (Sitzungsber.         d. phys.     med.
  Societdt zu Erlangen,            1891),   1*4 x 105    times that of the sun.          The
 coefficient        of transformation         of cathode       rays into Rontgen rays
  must, therefore,          be very small.
      In    drawing a conclusion from this investigation, one must bear

438          Proceedings of Royal Society      of Edinburgh.        f
in mind that no account has heen taken of the energy lost by the
Riintgen    radiation in passing through the walls of the Rimtgen
lamp, and that a particular    coefficient of transformation of energy
into luminescence has been assumed.        It  is evident, however, from
the results obtained, that the true average       power of the Rontgen
rays, i.e., their energy divided  by their duration as such, is much
greater   than generally supposed, and that about ten gram- calories,
per second    may be taken as a lower limit to its magnitude.
   To Professor E. Wiedemann and his assistant         Dr E. Miiller my
best thanks are due for the help they so      kindly  gave  me in  carry
ing out this investigation.

    In   vol. vi. of the Zeitsehrift      fur    Phyeikaiiache       Chemie      (1890),
pp. 16-36, Xernst demonstrates              the    relation between the osmotic
pressure of a given solution             of   N in A and           the    difference of

Immediately         after this paper,     Nernst
describes (I.e., pp. 37-40) an osmotic
experiment in which the " semiperme
 able     membrane"       is  a  layer    of    the
 liquid B held in its place by capil

    So far    as  the diffusion of    A through
 the    layer    of B from the        A  side     to
 the solution side is concerned,         Nernst's      experiment can         be  shown
 without      fixing the layer       of B.     In    the   form exhibited         to the
 Society, A is water, B phenol, and N calcium nitrate.                               The
 solution was taken of such            concentration that its density is con-

siderably greater     than that of phenol.        It will   be seen that      the
layer of phenol gradually rises in the cylinder.
   There is one point not explicitly referred to by Nernst, which is,
however, of interest.     It is the cause of the stoppage of the     diffusion
through the layer of     B when     the difference   of pressure on the      two
sides becomes     equal to the osmotic     pressure.    Increase of pressure
increases   the solubility    of   A in B,      and  when this increase         of
solubility  just   balances    the diminution      of solubility  due to      the
presence of    N,  the layer of    B will    become   homogeneous,    and the
gradient of concentration, the cause of the passage of            A from the
A  side, having disappeared,      there will be equilibrium.
   We may therefore say,       if A is shaken up with B under pressure
p,  and   a given solution of N in A is shaken up with B under
pressure   p,  the solutions of    A in B formed in the two         cases    will

have   the same     concentration     if p —p     is  equal   to the  osmotic
pressure.     As it  is possible,  by optical means, to ascertain        when
the two solutions have the same concentration, a practical            method
of determining osmotic pressure might be founded on this relation.

   (1) As is well known, the first rule given for ascertaining the
sign of a single term of a determinant was made known by Cramer
in his Introduction                       à l'Analyse              des Lignes        Courbes               algébriques,
published at Geneva in 1750.                               On page 658 he                 says —
            " On donne                  à ces termes les signes                  + ou      —       selon la Règle

        nul, le terme aura le signe +                          ;    s'il est impair, le terme aura le
        signe     -   .       Par         ex.     dans le        terme       Z1    Y^3 il              n'y       a    aucun
        dérangement                 :     ce terme        aura       donc le signe +                   .     Le       terme
        Z3Y1X2 a aussi le signe +                          ,   parce       qu'il    a deux dérangements,

      According           to Cramer, therefore,                     If    h be     the number               of   derange
ments in the permutation corresponding to any term, the sign of
 the term is (            -   )*.
      Instead of the word " dérangement," Gergonne * in 1813 used
 " inversion " in speaking of Cramer's rule                                   :    Cauchy      t           did the same
 in    1841   :       and,        consequently, the latter term or

 order"       has         come           into      pretty general use.                    "Inverted-pair"                  is
 probably       a      still better               expression.};

Cramer's.
   In   § 5, p. 266, he considers          a   pair of permutations which are so
related that the one is got from the other by the interchange                         of
two of the elements            of the   latter — " zwo Permutationen, welche

versetzt sind         and he succeeds in proving that two permutations
having this relationship must, according to Cramer's rule, differ                     in
sign.    As  a  corollary to this he asserts that we can easily deter
mine whether          two permutations            have    like  or unlike    signs   by
counting the       number of interchanges necessary                to transform     the

case it is circular substitutions that are counted.                               It   may be stated

    The former of these two ways is that generally followed                         ;  and,
clearly, when this is done, the last item is necessarily                   0, the second
item from the end          1   or  0, the   third item from the end          2 or  1  or 0,
and so on.
    A modification of         the former mode is got by arranging the items
differently, viz.,
                                     4 + 2 + 0 +    1+0,
where      4   is the number of inverted-pairs                in which       the   highest
element      5   comes    first,    2  the number in which the next highest
element 4 comes first, and so on.                  If the inverted-pairs be written
in rows according to this arrangement,                 thus
                                    51     52     53     54

                                    21
the columns so formed             will   give   the items obtained by the second
mode,     viz.,
                                     3+1+2+1+0.
    (9)  If   with    a  view to finding all the            possible    forms of      8  wo
try to fill n places subject to the conditions that the last place is
to be   filled with 0, the second             from the end by        1   or 0, the third
from the end by 2 or              1  or 0, and    so  on, we see that the filling of
the places       can be done         in 1.2.3          n different ways.          And,   as
this is  exactly the number of different permutations of n things,
it follows       that the determination             of the permutation          from the
detailed specification of the number of its inverted-pairs                       must    be
always possible.

   The mode of dealing with this converse problem will be under
stood from an example,       say the case where
                            8= 2+ 3 + 0 +      1+0.
We look     to the first item 2 and ask ourselves            which of the five
elements    1,  2, 3, 4, 5 must      be   put first   so  that there may be
only two elements     less than     it to follow   after, and the answer is
clearly the element      3.    Then we turn to the second              item of       8,
viz., 3, and ask which of the remaining elements                 1, 2, 4, 5     must
be put next so that there may be exactly three elements                   less than
it to follow after, and the answer is the element                5.     Again, we
turn to the third item of      8, viz., 0, and ask which of the remaining
elements    1, 2, 4 must be put next      so  that there may be no element
less than it to follow after, and the answer is 1.             Continuing         this
procedure    we find the required permutation to be
                                  3 5   14    2.

6 (i.e., 3!) zeros, 6 ones, 6 twos, 6 threes                ;  that the second column

     (12)   It  follows from this that each of the integers from                     1 up
  to n\ has corresponding to it a special form of                      S, that therefore
  when any integer is given we ought to be able to determine the
  corresponding value of            8  in full detail, and conversely, that when
  the details of      8  are given the number of the corresponding                    per
  mutation should be obtainable.
     The theorem which            effects the latter determination is —

shall find for the same reason                                   that the existence of the item                     <u

the number of this permutation                                    is    1   more than
                  cu(»-l)!            +     o2.(n-2)!              +    . . .   + a„_t.l!         + a„
as was to be proved.
     For example, the number of inverted-pairs being
                                                  2+3+0+1+0
as   in    § 9, we     multiply             2    by 4!,      3   by 3!, and           1   by   1!,    take the sum
of the products, and thus find the permutation to be the 67th.
     From this it          is evident                 that    if,    on the other hand, the ordinal
number of the permutation be known, we have only to take the
integer next less than                          it,   divide this integer by                      2   and note the
remainder, then divide the integral                                     part of the quotient by               3    and
note the remainder, then divide                                        the integral            part of the new
quotient        by    4        and note the remainder, and so on.                                        This being
done, the remainders are, when reversed                                         in order, the items which
constitute       8    for the permutation in question.                                     For example,        if   it
were the 54th permutation, the process would be

six permutations,         2  more     than for the corresponding one of the
second set of six          permutations, and          3  more    than for the corre
sponding    one of the first set, which first set consists                simply of the
permutations       of   12    3.   Further,      for either of the last two per
mutations     of    12   3, the   number of inverted-pairs is               1  more    than

none      of the      ^n(n-l)            pairs of elements                    is inverted, and in the

therefore with                       l)-8       inverted-pairs.                      This implies that for

exactly the permutations of nn                           — 1       ...    2     1   ; hence

All that is         necessary is to copy out in one column the 24 numbers

     It   follows, of course, from this mode of constructing the five
columns,       that      if    we wish to know how often any number, say                                            7,

    Making now      one continuous column of the above 120 numbers
by putting the      second column under the first, the third              under the
new position of the second, and so on, we should obtain the first
120    of the    720 numbers of inverted-pairs               wanted for the case
of the permutations of          1 2 3   4 5 6, the 600 others         being got by
forming five adjacent columns          as before.     It   is clear, therefore, that

Now it will         be   found that the combinations in any column here
are got     from those of the preceding column in                       a  manner closely
resembling that specified in the practical rule for the construction
of the table of         g 16.     For example, if        we wish       to form       the com
binations of four letters taken from a,bb,rcc, we go to the preceding
column and take               over without       change      the     combinations there
given     (i.e.,   none)     of four letters,     then take the combinations of
 three letters,      viz., abb, and annex a r, then the combinations of two
 letters,   viz. ab,bb,       and annex two           c's to   each,      and finally          the
 separate letters a,b, and annex three '-'s to each.                      The correspond
 ing operation in connection with the table of                   § 16 is
                                 V4,4 =  0 +   1+2   + 2 = 5.
 It  is thus seen that        if the problem      be to find not the           combinations
 themselves        but the number of them,                the   difference-equation              is
  exactly the same as before,            and the initial conditions are also the
  same   if  we make the usual convention that in every case when we
  omit all the letters one combination is to be counted                     ;  that is to say,

     (25) There is still another problem which has for its solution
exactly the same double series of numbers as we have tabulated in
§ 16,    viz., tli'i  ¦problem      of finding        the number         of positive     integral
divisors of ab'Vd4          . . .  where a,b,c,d,         . . .  are integers    prime     to ont
another.       In fact,      the   related table in          § 24    may be viewed either
as a table of combinations, as was intended, or as a table of                                   the
said divisors.        Of  course, for the latter purpose,                the insertion of       the
row of l's referred to at the close of § 24 is a necessity, 1 being a
divisor in every case --the co-factor, in fact, of the divisor of
highest degree.
     (20) To bring out still more clearly the connection between the
three problems, let it bo observed that the table of combinations
in   § 24 is also by implication a table                  of the permutations of            1 2 3
.  .  . arranged in order of the number of inverted-pairs which                               they
contain.      This fact        is not so readily perceived                as the   identity      of
the combinations of § 24               with the divisors of            § 25, but  a little care
suffices to establish it.

and this new column                      is seen to contain the 24                         permutations of
1        2 3    4 separated            into sevfin      sets,      viz.,      those        which        have no
inverted-pairs, those                  which have one, those which have two, and
so forth.
  (27) A comparison of the number of inverted-pairs in one per
mutation with the number in the conjugate permutation*     was
originally            made       by Rothe in the paper above referred to.                                     The
following simple fundamental                           theorem,         however, puts the matter
in a fresh light : —
     Jf in any permutation                of   1, 2, 3, . . . ,         n any       one    of    the elements A
be       in   the   1th   place and any other          p   be    in     the mtb place, then accord
ing as         Xp is or is not an invertedpair                    there      frill    be   in    the conjugate
permutation an inverted-pair ml or an uninverted-pair lm.
     To       say that      \p   is an inverted-pair of the original permutation                                is
the same as to say that A>w and precedes p, that                                           is,   that
                                           A   >   p   and m >         /.
Now, in the conjugate permutation                               the      element      I      will   be   in   the
Xth place and the element m in the                              /Xth   place    :    consequently, since
\>p the             element       m    will in that permutation                 precede           the element
/:       and therefore, since m>l, ml will be an inverted-pair.                                               The
reasoning           is    exactly similar when             \p   is     an uninverted-pair.
     Thus in the permutation
                                          367892154
75       is   an inverted-pair, and since the places of these two elements
are respectively                 the   3rd and 8th,         it    follows           that 83 must be an

inverted-pair       39    in    the given    permutation        corresponds to         the
uninverted-pair        15 in the conjugate permutation.
    From this it follows that conjugate permutations                  have the same
number of inverted-pairs, and therefore have the same sign — which
is Rothe's proposition.
                                         Moves.
    (28) The next subject which it is convenient to consider is that
of " moves," and at the outset it is important to note that whereas
the number of inverted-pairs in any given permutation                       is definite,
the number of moves which may be used to transform a given per
mutation into the standard permutation                     is in general indefinite,
because of the possibility of proceeding in divers ways in making
the    moves.      If   it   be agreed, however,         to   make the       moves      in
orderly fashion, viz., so         as  to put the elements        in order into their
standard places, the number is quite definite, and it is this                   number
which    ji is used to denote.          Thus, for the permutation
                                        2 4  15    3
we have ft = 4, because            to attain   the    standard permutation it           is
necessary to put       1   into its standard place — which requires 2            moves,
and then 3      into its standard place — which requires other 2.
    Of  course, we mi^ht put the elements               in  reverse order into their
standard places, but,          as will  be seen immediately, the total number
 of moves would not then be different.                  Thus, for the permutation
2 4 1 5 3,    we should have           to put    5   into its standard      place, then
 4, and then     2, the     number of necessary moves thus being 1+2 + 1,
i.e., 4 as before.
                                                                    " moves     "
     (29) The fundamental proposition in regard to                                is the
 following : —

Now the number of "moves" necessary to transform the permuta

place, and so on.                       But the number             necessary to put                 1   into the first
place must be a, because from consideration of the inverted-pairs
we     know that there are exactly a integers preceding 1. Again,

1   into its standard place.                        Similarly            the    number of moves                      neces

say,   is   the same               as    the number of " inverted-pairs."
   (30)         If
            in the preceding proof we had arranged the inverted-pairs
differently, viz.,   we had begun with those in which the highest

first, and            so on, the               total number              being thus partitioned                       into
a'

     In this way                we see that the number                     of   mores      necessary to trans
form a given permutation                                 into the standard permutation                               is   the
tame ichether we                    put      the elements in order, or in reverse order, into
their standard places.
     (31) Further, the lowest possible number  mores     secured when            of                is
tlte elements  are put in order, or in reverse order, into their stan
dard places.
     Xo move              can free us of more than one inverted-pair                                    ;   and, there
being    8      inverted-pairs,                it   follows that the least possible number of
moves       is       S.       But       8,   as we have     just        seen,   is    the number of moves
made     when we proceed                           in orderly       fashion      ;     the theorem               is   thus
established.

                                             INTERCHANGES.
  (32) Coming now to the subject of "interchanges" we have
again to observe that the number of them is indefinite unless they
are made in accordance                  with     a more       or less orderly plan.
   Interchanges                   into two kinds, effective and in

effective, an interchange being effective when it is practised upon
two elements which are not in their standard places, and,                                                as the
result of       it,     one at least          of them         is   brought           into    its    standard
place.         An   effective        interchange may be singly or doubly                               effective,
according       as      one      or both elements                 are    brought by          it    into their
standard places.                 Thus, in the permutation

the interchange6^2 would be doubly                                  effective,       3^1 singly            effec
tive, 4^,2 and 2^7 ineffective. We                                     may even           hold that        there
are three degrees of inefficiency, the second                                degree being exempli
fied by     2«h>7,      which throws one of the elements out of its                                 standard
place, and leaves the other, which was not in its standard place                                                at
the outset,         still in     need of removal.
     If   the interchanges be all effective, the number,                              it    will   be found,
is   quite definite, and              it   is    this number which                   is     denoted        by
Thus, for the permutation

4    and   5   by 4^5.
     Of    course we might vary this procedure                             by putting the           elements
in   a    different order into their standard places, but, as will                                      be seen
later, the number of necessary interchanges would                                         not be        altered.

sary to put the first n         -2   elements   into their standard places, the
remaining          two elements      must at the        worst   be  in    each   other's
place,      and therefore the interchange               of them     will    be   doubly
effective.
    (34) The fundamental              proposition in regard to "interchanges"
is as follows       :—
    If     X    and      n be any ttro elements of any permutation of
1,  2, 3,   . . . , n, and d be the number of element* lying between them
and intermediate to them in value,                the interchange X-^/j. mill in
crease     or diminish tlie number of inverted -pairs by 2d             + 1   according
 as X   is  less or greater than p.
    Let    the given permutation be
                                    X            /x
 and   consider first the        case  where   \>/i.       Then in comparing the
 numbers        of inverted-pairs      before  and      after the interchange,       the
 elements       preceding X and those following              /» may  clearly be left
 out   of account      ;  that is to say, we have         only got to consider the
 portion
                                      X             /x.
 Now,    if   X be moved so as to follow immediately after             /u., thus giving
 the   permutation
                                                F,X.
 the   number of inverted-pairs is thereby diminished by d                    + 1 : and
 if to effect the interchange spoken            of in the enunciation fi        be next
  moved to      the former place of     X, thus giving the desired permutation
                                      H              X,
  the  number of inverted-pairs is further diminished                 by d.       Hence
  the total    diminution     of the number is 2d        + 1, as was to be proved.

                          CIRCULAR     SUBSTITUTIONS.
   (35) Before      proceeding further         with the subject of "inter
changes," or
                 " transpositions "    as   Cauchj' called them, it will be
convenient      to   take   up   that    of   " circular substitutions "       and
Cauchy's rule of 1812.
   On referring back to      § 3 it will   be seen that the first thing need
ful in connection with      the latter is to write down       the substitution
which is required for the transformation of the given permutation
into the standard permutation, and then decompose or factorise it
into substitutions which are circular.           The best mode of obtaining
the   factors will be readily understood by observing the applica
tion of it to a particular       case,   say the    case  of the   permutation
8 7 1 5 4 6 3 2.
   The substitution      needed   to change      this into the standard      per
mutation being
we begin with the first element         of the lower line, viz.,   8, and leam
of course that it has to be changed into             1 ; proceeding then     to 1
in the lower line we find that it has to be changed into                3 ; simi
larly that    3  has to be changed        into  7, 7  into 2, and    2 into the
element   with which      we started.      This  process gives us the partial
 substitution
which from its nature is called "circular" or " cyclic."              After  this
there remains the substitution
which being dealt with in similar fashion is separated            into
 so that we have finally
            '1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8'

   (36) From an examination of this process it will be seen that
        (a) A circular substitution is one in which the upper line of
               elements is got from the lower by removing the first
                       element of the latter to the last place, and tliat conse
                       quently it may be represented by only one line, e.g.,

        (b)      There is only              one    tcay    of    decomposing        a substitution into
                       circular substitutions

                       any permutation                    into    the       standard    permutation          is
                          definite.
 Further, it may be noted                             that   a    "two-termed"            or    "binomial"

 as    many ways as there are elements                             in   each line.
       (37)     We        are now prepared for the important propositions which
 connect the number of                           " interchanges "           necessary     to transform       a
  given permutation into the standard permutation with                                           the number
  of  "circular substitutions" required for                                  the   same purpose.         The
  first —is
       If in     the lower line            of   a circular substitution              of   m elements tiro
  dements         separated           by   p   others be interchanged there                 is   produced     cc
  substitution            which can            be resolved        into two circular substitutions
  of    m   -   (p    +   1)   and    p
                                      +     1     elements respectively.
       Let the given circular substitution                          be

and y,x the pair of elements                             in   the lower line, so that the resulting
substitution is

fashion the items of the substitution, viz., a-into-y3, /}-into-y
we necessarily find that, instead of going as before from y to                                                    8,
and so on through                        the whole of the remaining elements,                            we go
from y to           a more          advanced element in the upper line than                              8, viz.,

we began, viz., a, thus obtaining the shorter circular substitution

which          also       is    necessarily circular.                    Further,      as    the    elements
S,c             ,   (j>   are   p   in number, the number of elements in the                              latter
circular substitution                     p
                                         is     +   1.
      The case where the two interchanged elements                                      are consecutive
in the cycle should be noted in passing.                                        One of the two             com
ponent circular substitutions will then be monomial, the                                           result      of
the        change         being to            put   the       second     element into its           standard
place.
      (38) From this
                                    it   follows that —
      If      in a giren permutation                       of   n elements two element?             be    inter
changed which are                    in       the same cycle            of   substitution the      resultitij
permutation will hare one cycle more than the given -permutaiion.
     Consequently, by continuing                               to   make      such   interchanges,            the
resulting cycles may lie made all monomial, and therefore                                           be     «   in
number.             This        means         that each element                would    then       be    in    its
standard place, and that the number of such interchanges                                           would       be
the excess of n over the original number of cycles.                                         We thus       learn
that—

   If a given permutation                  of   n elements have k eyelet             of substitution,
it can be transformed into                      the   standard permutation                   by means    of
n — k interchanges, provided                    every   pair of interchanged                 elements be,
hefore interchange,            in    tlie same cycle.
   The equivalence             of Cauchy's rule of " circular substitutions " with
the rule of " interchanges                 "
                                                is thus made manifest.
   (39)      If
           in transforming a given permutation into the standard
permutation tee confine ourselves to effective interchanges only, the
number necessary               will still        be n   - k.
   For,     an effective           interchange, being an interchange 'which brings
at least one of the two elements concerned                              into its standard place,
must be an interchange of two consecutive elements in                                        a cycle,   and
the only difference will be that a monomial cycle will be split off
by every operation.
   Here, in passing,                it may      be noted as self-evident that the order
in which       effective       interchanges are made is immaterial.
   (40) The interchange of two elements in different partial- circular
substitutions destroys the circular character of both substitutions, but

    (41)  If in any permutation of n elements there be k cycles of sub
              -
stitution, n k is the smallest number of interclianges necessary to
transform    it into  the standard permutation.
   To transform the permutation into the standard permutation
implies that the number of cycles is to be increased to n.                Now,
any two elements of the permutation miut be either in the same or
different cycles,    and   we have       seen that the interchange of two,
which are in different cycles, does not lead to an increase             in the
number of cycles.         To attain our        end  with the fewest possible
number of interchanges, we must, therefore, in every case choose
two elements      which     are in the same cycle.          When    we do this,
however, n    - k such interchanges         are known     to be necessary   and
sufficient.    The lowest possible number is thus n            — k.
    (42) It follows, therefore, from § 39, that the lotcest possible
number of interchanges necessary to transform a given permutation
into the standard permutation is secured by using only effective
interchanges.     This   is important from a practical point of view, be
cause effective    interchanges are easily recognised.            To seek for
pairs of elements which are in the same cycle of substitution would
be much more troublesome.              Besides, it implies that the cycles of
substitution are known        ;   and, if this  be the case, the consideration
of interchanges is in practice unnecessary.
    As  a matter of theory, however, it is curious to note the manner
in which, when we follow the more troublesome                  process  and in
doing so use an ineffective interchange, we are compensated                 at  a
later stage by an additional           doubly-effective interchange.      Thus,

if   we confine ourselves                   to effective         interchanges we shall, in the
course         of the transformation               of the permutation, meet with only
two doubly-effective interchanges ; but                               if,   in selecting two elements
of   the second             cycle, we make             an ineffective interchange — say the
interchange             6*»-7,    — the    cycle   is   split up into
and       then we have three cycles of more than one element each, and
therefore must be led later to three doubly-effective interchanges.
     (43)      We have now dealt with four of the five rules of signs, and
have      seen how they are related                     to one another.
                                                                Summing up, we

changes   necessary to transform the permutation into the standard
permutation, k the number of " circular substitutions
                                                      "
                                                        needed for
the same purpose,                 and       the smallest number of
                                                                                       " moves," then

                                                   v   =n   —   k.
Consequently,                so far as we know,                 two of the four numbers are
unrelated,           namely,       8   and k.      Of    the former — the                   number of " in
                        "—        full investigation            has been given above.                        In    the
verted-pairs                 a
case of the          latter — the number of "circular substitutions" — such                                          is
unnecessary, as may be seen from several                                     papers         by Cauchy, the
founder           of the theory of substitutions.*                          The theorem            of the fol
lowing         §   is   the only fresh result which has been arrived at in the
course of the present investigation.

 must be       a  circular substitution for the case of the conjugate permu
 tation.
     (45) Included in this is the fact that conjugate permutations have
 the same number of circular substitutions, and therefore have th*
 same sign.          Also, from § 41 it follows that conjugate permutation*
 require the same number              of  interchanges.         Indeed, whichever of
  the five      rules of signs      we employ, the number               of things       to b*
 counted in the case of any permutation is the same                        as   in the case
  of the conjugate permutation.
      (46)    Since in    a  self-conjugate permutation the circular substitu
  tion must remain unaltered by reversal,                 it follows that       the  circular
  substitutions of a self -conjugate permutation                 must     l>e  either mono
   mial or binomial.
      This    enables us to determine the total number of self-conjugate
   permutations of n elements.              For, confining ourselves              to  circular
   substitutions       of these     two   kinds,       we have      only     to    count the
   number of possible           cases with no binomial           circular substitutions,
   those    with only     one, those with only two, and so on.                 The result is

    (47) The last of the five rules of signs may bo quickly disposed
of.   Like Cauchy'a it makes use of " circular substitutions," but,
unlike Cauchy's, is not explicitly dependent upon the number of
elements  in the permutation. The easiest way, therefore, to con
nect it with the others is to deduce it directly from Cauchy's.

even,    and the total number in the                    k0   substitutions         is even   or odd
according                        From these it follows by addition
                 as k0 is even or odd.
that the total number of elements in both kinds of substitutions — -

       Tidal Currents of the North Sea. By Alexander
                              Buchan, LL.D., F.R.S.
                                 (Read February 20, 1899.)
     In  the article    "Tides " in      the Encyclopaedia     Britannica,      Professor
 George      Darwin, quoting Sir George B. Airy, remarks                        that the
tides of the North Sea present a very remarkable peculiarity.                       Along
 the eastern coast of England              as   far as the mouth of the          Thames,
 the    tide-wave,       coming from          the    Atlantic   round      the    Orkney
 Islands, flows towards the south.                Thus, on a certain day, it is high
water     in the Moray         Firtli    at 11    a.m., at Berwick        at 2   p.m.,    at
Flaruborough          Head at       5  p.m., and    so on to the     entrance      to the
Thames.          Thus, on the day supposed, it will be high water off                   the
Thames at         11 p.m.,  the tide having travelled in twelve hours from
the Moray         Firth.
    It  is further      stated    that the North Sea is considerably               deeper
on the      English    side   than on the German side;              so much so, that
the tide-wave coming from the north runs into a deep bay of                           deep
water, bounded on the west side by the Scottish and English                         coasts
a*    far   as   Newcastle, and on the             east side  by   the great Dodger
 Hank.       As far    as the   latitude of Hull, the English side is still             the
deep one       ;  and   though       a  species    of channel through the            shoal
there allows an opening to the                 east, yet immediately on the south
of it is the Wells Bank, which again contracts the deep channel                           to
the English side.
    It  is not stated       here     that the deeper      water of the North            Sea
close to the Scottish          and     English    coasts determines the course of
the southward          tidal flow to be close to these coasts          ;   but for     that
course taken, no other cause is suggested.

kinds of floats were used by                          Dr Fulton — namely, bottles                      and slips
of wood — and very                   full details        are given as to the method employed
in conducting the experiments.
      The number of floats set adrift on the east coast of Scotland,
within 20 miles of the shore south of the Pentland Firth, was
1864       ;    in the neighbourhood                   of the Pentland Firth, 369                        ;   on the
route to Christiansand,                       630;       on the route to Hamburg, 520                         ;   and
between a point 12 miles off Flamborough                                            Head and the Hook of
Holland, 2u0             ;    and others were                 put into the            sea     off the east coast
at a distance                greater       than 20 miles.                    Of    the above, the number
found on various coasts                         up to the end                 of March 1897 was nearly
700, which were forwarded to the Fishery                                           Board.
      The results of discussion of the returns received by the Board are
thus summarised by                        Dr Fulton : —
      " The      surface        Atlantic water                passes southwards                 and eastwards
from the Shetlands and Orkneys                                 ;    it then moves southwards along
the east coasts               of Scotland and England                             to the     neighbourhood of
the       Wash, impinging                     more    or less on the coasts that run at an
angle to          it,   such    as Banff,            Aberdeen, Fife, East Lothian,                      Berwick,
and       the East of England as far                      as       Spurn Head.               Thence the move
ment of the              surface          water   is   eastwards              towards the Continent, the
 main body impinging                        on the coast of Denmark north of the Horn.
The course              is     then northward                      to   the       Skagerrak and the west
 coast         of Norway,           as    far at least    as the         Loffodens."
      These are stated to be the regular and                                      predominating courses of
 the      currents of the North Sea                      as    arrived at by this system of obser
 vation of the movements                        of the surface water.                  It will    be noted that
 for the coasts of Scotland                          and England, as far south as the Wash,
it
is        identical with the course of the tidal currents of the North Sea
 as    given in the Encijclopicdia                       Britannva article                   on the   "Tides."
      In August              1865,       Dr     George     Keith undertook,                   at the request of
 the      Council of the Scottish Meteorological Society, to make observa
 tions on the temperature of the                               sea      on    a    cruise in the yacht             "St

showed that the temperature           fell from 62°-0 near Yarmouth Koads
to 58o,0 near      the Wash, and to 56°'5 off Scarborough                   ;  but    from
this point northward       to Lerwick,       the temperature          was    virtually       a
constant,   being 55°-5 on entering Bressay Sound.                    The area over
spread by this substantially uniform             temperature        on the east coast
of Great Britain is virtually coincident with the southward flow of
the tidal current from the          Atlantic     as   determined by Dr Fulton.
Observations of the surface         temperature        of the    sea on these coasts
amply confirm those made by Dr George Keith in 1865.
    Hie wind     also has an important            influence on the currents of
the   North    Sea.    The winds have been observed                  by the Scottish
Meteorological Society's observers             from 1856,         and    the averages
during these forty-three years drawn from observations                         at about
sixty stations      show that the average number of days the different
 winds have prevailed during the year are               : —

 Thus the     prevailing    winds      are   W.S.W.       ;  and    the    observations
 further show that these          are   by far the strongest of the               winds.
 Now these strong W.S.W. winds, considered                   as  producers     of surface
 currents of the       sea   flowing      from      the     British   coasts     towards
 Denmark, the Skaggerrak, and Norway, are necessarily                         most effec
 tive near the southern limits of the            tidal currents from           the north
 or about the Wash, and thence eastward.
    This  is well shown by       Dr Fulton's chart of the          observed currents,
 on which    it is  seen that the floats        crossed the      North     Sea between
 latitudes 55* to 53" N.       ;  and thence, curving           round, impinged           on
 the Danish      coast near      Faro and      round to Skagen           ;  and    thence
 diverted through the Skaggerrak;              and thence        northward,      keeping
 close to the Norwegian coast as far as the Loffoden Islands.                           The
  prominent characteristic of this current chart is that north of                       lati
 tude 55° N., few or none of the floats are represented                        as having
 crossed the    North   Sea.     North of this parallel the strongest              inflow
 ing tidal currents keep near the east coast of Great Britain,                    and the

1898-99.]    Dr Buchan    on  Tidal Currents of the North        Sea.   481
strongest outflowing tidal currents keep near the coasts of Denmark
and Norway.        The cause of this striking     peculiarity admits of    a
simple explanation.       Since,  as the tidal currents from the north
flow southwards, they advance        over regions where      the velocity of
the earth's rotation constantly increases, and consequently lagging
behind, they press in toward the east coast of Great Britain          ; and
on the    other hand, as the   outflowing tidal currents proceed north
wards, they advance over regions where the velocity of the earth's
rotation constantly diminishes, and consequently press close on the
coasts   of Denmark   and Norway.
    It is a singular circumstance that the North Sea is the only         sea
in the Northern Hemisphere           quite  open   to large   tidal currents
 from a    contiguous   ocean,   which   flow southwards       with flowing
 tides and northwards with      ebbing tides   ; and   it is probably owing
 to this circumstance that hitherto, so far as       I  am aware, the rota
 tion of the earth has not been adduced       in explanation of the most
 striking peculiarity of these tidal currents.

On the Development and Morphology of the Marsupial
      Shoulder-Girdle.            By R. Broom, M.D., B.Sc.                     Com
      municated by Sir "William Turner.
                             (Read January 9, 1899.)
                                   (Abstract.)
   An examination        is    made   of   a   series    of early stages    in   the
development of the shoulder-girdle                in   the common Phalanger
(TrichosurU), vulpecula), and of early stages in the development of
that of the Ring-tailed         Phalanger     (Pseudochirus peregrinus), and
of the    Rock-wallaby        (Petrogale penicillata).          Though    in their
main features     there   is much similarity between the girdles of the
different genera, there are certain peculiar features in each.
   In  a Trichosurus      foetus of 8"5      mm., though the main part of
the scapula is chondrified, together with the glenoid portion of the
coracoid and    a   portion of the acromion,            the rest of the arch, the
sternum, and the greater          part of the clavicle, are still mesenchy-
matous.     The    coracoid can       be   traced      downwards as a fan-like
expansion, which meets the first rib and the sternum.                     Between
the coracoid    and     the clavicle       a    feebly-developed       thin    sheet
apparently represents        the  precoracoid (epicoracoid).          The clavicle
is partly ossified    at its upper part,        and it is very manifest that
there is no cartilaginous basis.
   In  the Trichosurus      foetus, at birth (14 mm.), the scapula is well
developed.     The acromion is         a large     process   which springs from
the anterior border of the blade.             The spine is not yet formed,
though its basis can be distinctly traced            as a  membranous structure
stretching from the acromion upwards along the outer side of the
scapula   in its anterior third.        There is no cartilaginous basis for
this part of the spine.        The coracoid is of large size, and its lower
part, which is somewhat         bulbous, articulates with the sternum and
with the first rib.
   In  the later development         it is shown that         the girdle becomes
detached from the sternum, owing to degeneration                   of a portion of

the bulbous         end of the coracoid.         By   the time the foetus is 23 mm.
in length,        the girdle is quite detached.
     In     the Pseudochirus         fcetus of 16 mm., the coracoid,           though in
contact with the presternum, is not structurally                       continuous with
it.
     In    the early foetus of Petrogale (21 mm.) the coracoid is of very
large size, and is continued backwards for some distance by the
side of        the  first rib.     It   is for a short distance structurally          con
tinuous with           the sternum.         In this  foetus no distinct omosternum
can be detected.
     In     considering      the   morphology       of the scapular borders,           the
following conclusions             are    arrived at : —
     (a) That        the    spine proper, having          no  cartilaginous      basis,  is
 the      homologue of the cleithrum                or epiclavicle       of   the   lower
 Theromorphs.                                                      •
      (b) That in the           Monotremes there is no supra-spinous fossa,
 owing       to the spine or cleithrum         being applied to the morphological
 anterior border;           while     in   the higher     mammals       a supra-spinous
 fossa has been formed, owing to the spine becoming applied to
  the outer surface of the                scapula,  and away from           the anterior
  border.
      With regard         to the    coracoidal elements,       the following      are the
  principal conclusions arrived at :—
      (a) That the well-developed coracoid in the                    fcetal   marsupials,
  and,     consequently, the coracoid process in the                  higher mammals
  generally, is the homologue              of the posterior coracoidal element in
  the Monotremes and Theromorphs, and of the coracoid in Reptiles
  generally.
       (b)   That    the    anterior     coracoidal    element    (" epicoracoid ") in
   Monotremes and Theromorphs is the homologue of the precoracoid
  of the Amphibia.
       (c) That the only representative of the precoracoid remaining in
   the higher mammals           is the coraco-clavicular ligament.
      The cartilage which           forms round        the   ends  of the clavicle       is
   regarded as of a secondary nature, and of no special morphological
   significance.

in his iirst memoir on chemical affinity (Jour, prakt. Chem.                      1879,
xix. 483), showed how to determine the magnitude of this                       decom
position, and was able to approximately                  measure     the quantity       of
free acid in solutions of the acid sulphates at different                  dilutions.
 In  a later paper (ibid., 1880, xxii. 305),           Ostwald investigated           the
question    of the influence of water on the action between                 sulphuric
acid and a neutral sulphate.            He measured         the changes   of volume
which     occurred     when      solutions   of     sulphuric     acid and     sodium
sulphate     were    mixed     in   varying    proportions,       and at     different
dilutions,    and obtained results in           agreement        with his    previous
work.      He also pointed out, that if the mutual action between                    the
acid and neutral sulphate obeyed            the general law of mass             action,
it should follow that, for         example,   one molecule         sodium    sulphate
plus three molecules        sulphuric acid, give the same quantity             of acid
 sulphate   as one molecule       sulphuric acid, and three molecules          sodium
sulphate, the volume of the mixture               being the same in       each case.
This, however, he showed was not true, little agreement being                    found

between the numbers which, according to the law, should                          be equal.
The differences were especially large at the highest dilutions.
   The following         investigation      was    undertaken         with     a  view     to
determine the hitherto            unascertained nature             of the equilibrium
which exists       in solutions of the acid sulphates,                and    in solutions
containing      sulphuric     acid  and      a  neutral sulphate in other than
equivalent proportions.          It  is evident from the results obtained by
the above mentioned investigators, that the equilibrium                          is one of
peculiar    interest,  as   being disturbed by mere dilution                  of the acid
salt solution.
   The free acid, neutral sulphate and acid sulphate,                    in the solution
of an acid sulphate,        are partially dissociated,         so   that, besides these
substances, the ions derived from tlicm are concerned                         in the final
equilibrium.       Chief among         the    equilibria     existing      between      the
various    substances      in solution, is      that,     however,      which      obtains
between      the undissociated portions of the free acid,                   neutral and
acid    sulphates,    and    it  was     the   particular       aim    of the      present
investigation     to determine the          nature of this equilibrium.                The
problem was treated quite empirically,                and    from the experimental
results obtained,     it   was sought to ascertain             the   law of the equi
librium,     and to formulate an expression                by means         of which it
would be possible         to calculate the percentage              of free acid       in   a
solution containing        sulphuric    acid   and     a  neutral sulphate         in any
proportions.
                                The Equilibrium.
   The chemical equation           representing the           formation      of an acid
sulphate    as a  balanced reaction is written thus: —
                         H2S04   +  M,S04      ^>   2MHS04.
According to the law of mass              action,   tho equilibrium between             the
undissociated      portion of these three substances in solution is given
by the expression
      (7.H2S04(1    -a,)x     C.M,S04(1 -a.,) = K{C'.MHS()4(l                  -a,)}-
 where   C.H2S04, C.M2S04 and (7.MHS04 are tho concentrations at
 equilibrium of the acid, neutral sulphate                       and acid        sulphate
 respectively,   (1-c^), (1-a.,) and (1-a.,)                the undissociated          pro
 portions  of each of these substances,           and    K  is a constant.

     It   is known,     however, that in the simpler case of equilibrinE
between       the undissociated portions of a strong acid or of a salt                 and
its ions, the law of mass action in its original form is not valid                    ; no
dissociation constant is obtained, according to Ostwald's well-known
 " dilution law," which            is simply the law of mass action applied              to
the equilibrium           in question.       As the equilibrium,      the   nature       of
 wliich it is here sought to determine, is that existing between                          a
strong acid, its neutral and its acid salt, it was therefore improbable
that it would follow as              a consequence    of this law, and      a brief in
spection       of the      figures    calculated from the experimental          results
justified     this conclusion.          In order to represent      the equilibrium
between        the ions and the          undissociated portion of      a  highly      dis
sociated      electrolyte, empirical         formulae    have   been    proposed,       as
modifications of Ostwald's expression, by Eudolphi (Zeit. phyrik.
 (.''•//)., xvii. 385), van"t Hoff {ihiJ., xviii. 301), and others. In
the same manner,              the   expression for the equilibrium        under con
sideration may          be     made    more  general   and  quite empirical       if   we
write it thus : —

where          and    n   are unknown        exponents.     The   expression     given
above is a particular ease             of this more   general equation,      where m
and a are the same and equal to 0'5.
     In    what follows, an experimental method is described by                 means
of which the concentrations of the acid,                neutral sulphate and        acid
sulphate      were determined, while           the values of  (1
                                                                 - a,)   (1  -a^    and
11   - a.)    were    calculated from Kohlrauch's           measurements       of the
electrical conductivity            of acids and salt solutions.        (ITiVi.   Ami.,
            xxvi.   1!)6.)      It  was   then possible,   by comparison       of the
re.-ults obtained for the various solutions, to find the values of                   the
exponents       )/' and     u, as  well  as the  mean value of the constant K.
The expression          was then completely determined.           Its  accuracy     was
tested by using          it   to calculate the percentage     of free acid in        the
various solutions, the values so obtained being then compared with
those actually observed.

                              Experimental            Method.
      The concentrations of           the free     acid,    neutral sulphate and acid
sulphate         in  solutions      containing      sulphuric      acid     and    a   neutral
sulphate were determined by means of                       a reaction    velocity method,
viz., by the catalysis of ethylic acetate.                    The velocity with which
a     solution    effects   the    catalysis gives       a   measure    of the free acid
which        it  contains.      As   the    experimental        method employed has
already been described by several                    investigators (Ostwald, Journ.
prakt.         Chem.,   xxxv.       112;    Arrhenius,        Zeitirh.    plajsik.      Cltem.,
 i.   110), it is unnecessary        that   I  should give it in detail here.
      Equal volumes of          a   known strength of ethylic acetate solution
 and of a solution containing sulphuric                  acid and a neutral sulphate
 ill definite proportions,             were     mixed at the temperature of the
 thermostat.         In order that disturbing            influences    should be reduced
 to a minimum, the solutions employed were                       made as dilute as was
  consistent with       a  sufficiently rapid catalysis, which would admit of
  accurate and convenient measurement                     at 35°'0.      It  was not advis
  able to use a higher temperature on account of the volatility                          of the
  ester.      The mixed solutions            were   so    prepared     that they had the
  correct concentrations           at the    temperature       of the thermostat.          One
  example       will suffice to indicate the procedure.
       It is wished to determine the velocity of catalysis with                    a solution
  containing 0-2 equivalent normal*                  sulphuric acid, andO'l equiva
  lent normal potassium            sulphate.       Forty    c.c. normal sulphuric acid
  were mixed with           20 c.c. potassium        sulphate solution of the same
  concentration,       and made up to 100 c.c. at 35°.                  Fifty    c.c. of this
   solution     were   then mixed with an equal                 volume of 0'2 normal
   ethylic     acetate, which was previously heated to the temperature                        of
   the thermostat,      and measured at that temperature.                    At  35  ',  and at
   the beginning of the           reaction,     the mixture was then 0'2 normal
    with respect      to sulphuric        acid,   and   O'l    normal with respect            to
    potassium     sulphate and to ethylic            acetate.      It was assumed          that
    the volume of the mixture was               equal to 100 c.c.          The concentra
    tion of the ethylic acetate was 0'1 normal in all the experiments.
        At intervals, portions of         5  or 10 c.c. were withdrawn by means
              *

 solution      of sodium hydrate was used, to which sufficient baryta

     Three series of experiments were made with these solutions.
     In  the first, the concentration     of the sulphuric acid was varied,
 and that of the potassium sulphate was constant; in the second
 the concentration of the potassium sulphate was                    varied, and that
 of the acid remained constant.            The third series was made with
 solutions containing equivalent quantities of the acid and neutral
 sulphate at varying dilutions.         Each series consists of five different
 experiments.        The    constants    were   calculated       according to       the
 expression

    The     percentage      of free acid in       a  solution containing      sulphuric
acid and       a  neutral sulphate was obtained by comparison of the
velocity with which it            effected the catalysis of the ester,         with the

                 Correction      op   the Velocity Constants.
     As   the neutral salts    in the solutions employed in these experi
ments do not of themselves           bring about the catalysis of the ethylic
acetate, this being affected only by the hydrogen ions arising                     from
the free      acid   present   at   the   same     time, the velocity          constant
obtained with any solution gives             a measure       of the free acid which
it  contains.      The standard of comparison             is the     velocity constant
measured       in the case of sulphuric           acid   alone,     of the same con
centration.        A constant obtained for sulphuric acid                 alone,  on the
one hand, and that for a solution containing                    sulphuric acid and      a
 neutral sulphate on the other, are not, however, immediately com
 parable.       Each must be corrected          in a manner which            I will now
indicate.
     It  is known that when a neutral salt is added to a solution of
 the corresponding monobasic            acid, the velocity with which the acid
 e fleets the catalysis of an ester is increased.                 As this influence of
 the neutral salt is considered to           be   of a physical nature, and due
 in   the   first instance to the action of the dissociated                 part of the
 added salt, it must be supposed, when the catalysis is performed with
 a   dibasic acid like sulphuric acid, to which               a  neutral sulphate has
 been added, that the influence exists here also                ;  and that, although
 in this latter case the velocity actually measured is                   less  than that
 obtained with sulphuric acid alone, (owing to the formation of the

1898-99.]            Sulphuric Acid and Sulphates in Solution*                                     495
acid sulphate) the neutral salt must exert an accelerative effect on
the    catalysis,     in the same manner and of the same magnitude as in
the    case of a monobasic       acid.
      We must therefore correct the velocity constants obtained with
solutions containing sulphuric acid and                     a    neutral sulphate, for the
accelerating influence of the latter.
      This influence       has been         measured     in      the    case of cane              sugar
inversionby Sphor (Zeit. physik.                     Cltem., 1888,           ii.   194),      and by
Arrhenius (/or. cit., 1889, iv. 226).                  The latter       has shown that the
increase     is    nearly equal for all salts, or        is     at least of the same order
of magnitude, and amounts to about 6"5 per                             cent,   for      an addition
of O'l equivalent neutral salt per litre.
      Trey (Jour, prakt.        Chem.,        1886,     xxxiv.         353),       on       the   other
hand, found in the catalysis of methylic acetate, an increase in the
velocity of about 3'5 per cent, when the same quantity of neutral
salt was added.
      As   the influence of neutral salts            on the       velocity of catalysis of
ethylic     acetate had not been measured,             I        made special         experiments
with hydrochloric acid           as     the   catalysing agent,           to determine the
influence of neutral chlorides in this reaction.                        These were carried
out in the same manner           as     already described for sulphuric acid and
sulphates, the increase         in the velocity constant obtained with acid
alone being determined for two concentrations of the neutral salt
in each      case.     The details are given below, and are arranged                                 as

following consideration must not be neglected.  The velocity with
which an acid effects the catalysis is dependent on its degree of
dissociation.             In    general,       when a neutral salt is added to an acid,
the    degree of dissociation of the latter is changed, and therefore
before       comparing            a    constant obtained                 when a neutral             salt is
present, with that measured                            in the      case of the acid alone,                the
value of the latter must be made equal to what would be found

addition             of the salt.       An example will show how                           the correction
was applied.

the velocity       with which the latter              effects    the catalysis of ethylic
acetate    ;  the increase       produced by any one salt is nearly propor
tional to the quantity added                ; and the increase             produced by equal
quantities of all the salts examined is the same, within the experi
mental error, its mean value being 4-4 per cent, for the addition of
0-l normal chloride.
    To return again to the           constants observed for solutions containing
sulphuric acid and         a  sulphate, we must correct them for the accelerat
ing influence of the latter, and, according to the above results, at
the rate of 4 '4 per cent, for each                0-l equivalent         present per litre.
    Before       these     corrected        constants       are     compared         with      those
obtained for sulphuric acid alone, the latter must be subjected to
a  reduction for the same reason and in exactly the snme manner
as that described above               for the hydrochloric              acid constants,          viz.,
for the change           in dissociation produced by the addition                               of   a
neutral sulphate.            The following example indicates (1) the correc
tion of a velocity constant obtained with a solution of acid and
 neutral salt, for the accelerating influenco of the latter; (2) the
reduction of the corresponding velocity constant for acid alone,
to the value it has when its degree of dissociation is equal to that
which obtains in (1).

THE CONCENTRATIONS OF FEEE ACID, NEUTRAL AND

     Having     thus determined what fraction                        of the total sulphuric
acid originally        present       in any solution exists            as    free acid when a

centrations of the free acid, and of the neutral and acid sulphates
in    the    mixture     are        easily calculated.          In     the    first series,             for

 already stated,             these were calculated from the work of                         Kohlrausch,
 using his newer values for the conductivity                                      at infinite         dilution
 (   Wied. Ann., 1893, L 408).
      The calculation of the degree of dissociation of sulphuric acid, and
 of   a    neutral sulphate in             a   solution containing them in definite pro
 portions was carried out in the following manner.
      The dissociations of sulphuric acid and of each neutral sulphat--
 at a number of dilutions were calculated.                               From these the concen
 trations of the ions at each dilution was obtained, and                                    a   curve was
 then drawn for each substance,                           in which ionic-concentration                      was
 plotted against dissociation.                     As    a first approximation, the dissocia
 tions of the acid and of the salt in any mixture were made equal                                             to
 the value which they would have,                          if   the concentration of each was
 equal      to the sum            of the        concentrations           of       the    acid and          sal:.
 (Arrhenius, Zeit. physihal.                    Cliem.,      1890, v.       1).    From the dissocia
tions thus obtained, the concentrations of the ions, due to the acid
on the one hand, and to the salt on the                                  other, were calculated.
The sum of these gave the total concentration of the ions, which
corresponded            to   a    certain dissociation on the ionic-concentration
dissociation curves referred to above.                            This   gave      a    second approxi
mation        to    the      real dissociations of                the acid and             of the          sals
(Macgregor, Phil. Mag.                     1896,    xli. 276), which did not,                   as   a    rule,
differ very much from the first.

error which may thus arise is one which affects each dissociation
degree        equally      (Kohlrausch,         Wied.     Ann.,     1893,   1.     400),    and

sulphuric acid and a neutral sulphate, the dissociation of the acid
salt was then calculated in the same manner as above indicated.

acid sulphate being              thus determined, the concentrations of the

           THE EXPRESSION FOR THE EQUILIBRIUM.
     It  is now possible      from these results to calculate the unknown
 exponents       m  and » and the value of the constant          K  in the general
 expression for the equilibrium given on p. 486, viz.: —

 If  we assume that m and          11 are the   same and equal to       —,   the ex
 pression     may be simplified, and       writing Cv      C.,, C3 for   Cj(l   -a    ),
 etc., we obtain

 From       the first series    a   fairly good     constant is obtained        with

 put    ?j = 0'75.     On this assumption one value of m can be found
 from any two experiments.             From the first of these we obtain

By inspection of the concentrations in the different experiments                   of
the first series,     it will be seen that C.,(l        a.,) varies but little,    so
that an error in the value assumed                 for the exponent       n,  (0'75)
will not      affect,   to any extent, the      magnitude of      m  calculated    in
this manner.
    The mean value of m was then obtained from the                      first  three
experiments        only, for    according    to   the   method     of   calculation

  experiment      in this series, the smallest         weight to the last, or in
  other words,     a small experimental error is exaggerated               in calcula
  tion very much        more     in the last     experiment than in the first.
  The mean value of m was 0'85.                 Now, in the second series, the
  variation    in 0,(1   -aj     is small,    while   0^(1    -a.,) varies consider
 ably from the first to the last experiment.                   Such conditions are
 most favourable for the calculation of a new value for the exponent
 n.    When this     was done in the same manner as above, m having
 the value 0-85, the value obtained for n was 0-89.                       It  appears,
 therefore,     then    m    and      n   are  nearly     equal,    and   if   we   put
 ?n  = 7}= 0'87 the      results    of the experiments will            be    expressed
 with    considerable     accuracy.
     But having decided that m=w, their value can be calculated

obtained.        In calculating the      mean      constant in each series, it      was
necessary,      as already stated, to assign to each individual               constant
its own " weight," which           varies very much in the different experi
ments.       It  was found in the following manner.                 An experimental
error of    1  per cent, was assumed          in the velocity constant, and the
corresponding percentage difference produced in                    K  was calculated.

number.

 ever, the constancy of        K   is not very    satisfactory, the different values
 obtained exhibiting         a marked rise       with the       increase    in the amount
 of free acid present.           This may      be seen by comparison               with the
 tables on p. 508.          It  is evident, therefore,          that the formula is not
 the   best   which      it is possible to obtain from the experimental
 results, and that by finding an appropriate

 expression could be arrived at.

and the acid sulphate

determined       by these),      the ratio                         ai)    was calculated.

    The steady rise in the value of the constant which was apparent
when the calculations were made with the previous expression for
the equilibrium, has now to a large                    extent disappeared,       and in
each    series   the constant        fluctuates      about the        mean   value.    In
examining the constancy             of   A it must         be remembered       that the
percentage      of free acid in any solution is the quotient of                       two
velocity constants,       and    as   the experimental            error may have th«
opposite    sign   in these two constants,              the    corresponding error ir.
the    percentage      of    free    acid      may be         considerably increased.
Further,     this error is much exaggerated                    in the constant      A,  as
for example, in one experiment an error of                     1  per cent, in the    per
centage    of free     acid    produces        a change       of   22  per cent,   in A.
This, however,      is the worst case, as may be seen by inspection                     of
the
      " weights " given      to the individual         constants.
    The mean value of         A for all      three    series is 0-259,     the greatest
difference between this and any of the mean values obtained from
each series separately       being less than         3 per cent.        In view of the
fact that the method of                calculation       emphasises      the errors     of
individual     experiments,     this will be accounted              fairly satisfactory.

The unknown factors in the general expression for the equilibrium
are   now determined,         and for solutions containing              sulphuric acid
and potassium sulphate it may be written

    The accuracy of this formula was then tested by making use of
it to calculate    the percentage          of free acid in the various solutions
of sulphuric acid and potassium                sulphate, the values         so  obtained
being then compared with those actually observed.                          In this way
we    eliminate the exaggeration              of experimental error which the
formula causes, and          can arrive at a better conclusion as to the
 value of the latter.       If  the expression       is a good one, the differences
between     the observed       and    calculated values should not be much
more than that due to experimental error.
    Let B     represent    the original concentration of the                acid, and   C
that of the sulphate.           At equilibrium let x            be the concentration
of   the   acid    sulphate.        According        to   the    above   equation the
equilibrium is expressed by

                           X(l-aJ                  (C-ZXI-O,)'
    When B      and  C   are known, the value of x is best calculated by
an approximation method.                Two     values   of x were chosen, one of
 which    gave a larger value of            A than that        observed     (0'259), the
other    a   smaller value.        The value        of x,     corresponding to the
observed constant         was then obtained by interpolation.                    After   a
little  experience,    it was easy to choose one value of x so that the
constant corresponding           to    it differed very little from that              ob
served, under which conditions it was possible                    to interpolate quite
accurately.
    The above expression         may be written thus          : —

     The general agreement between the two sets of numbers in each

In    these  the ordinates are the percentages              of free acid, while the

  where the calculated percentage                is below the observed,              instead   of
  above it as might be expected.
     On the whole, the agreement                  between       the observed         and calcu
 lated    values    is  fairly satisfactory.             The     mean      real     percentage
 difference between them is about                 1*5, and      while the experimental
 error is probably less than this, it may in some cases amount to                              as
 much    ; so  that if we take this into consideration, and at the same
 time the fairly wide range of the experiments, the expression                              may
 be   said to give at least a good             approximation           to the equilibrium
 actually existing in such solutions.
     From the percentages            of free acid in the various solutions other
 interesting     results      may be        obtained.          The     variation        of   this
 magnitude with the dilution, and with the ratio of acid to neutral
sulphate is seen at once in the curves.
    The     curve    in   fig.   1   shows     the    results     of    the    first series of
experiments,       in which         the   concentration          of the      acid     only was
varied.      If  this curve       is produced        till   it meets the origin of co
ordinates, it appears that the percentage                      of free acid rises at first
very rapidly as the concentration of the sulphuric acid increases,
and only when the amount of free acid in the solution has reached
about     55   per    cent,    does    the   rise   become        somewhat         slow.    The
                                                                                  1
continued curve          also shows,       for example,   1   ' that in      a          solution
                                                                                 100
of sulphuric       acid, at least       50    per cent, of the acid              still remains
uncombined        when as much              as   ten    times     the     concentration        of
neutral sulphate is added to it.
    If  the curve in fig.       2 is   continued      as    shown by the dotted line,
it meets the axis of y at the point 100, expressing the fact that
when the concentration of the                   neutral salt         is zero,     the acid     in
solution is wholly free.
    In   fig. 3 the     percentages       of free acid in solutions of the acid
sulphate      are    plotted      against     the    corresponding           concentrations.
It is evident that       the amount        of free     acid in the solution increases
with increasing dilution of the acid sulphate,                        a result     which is in
accordance       with     that of       previous observers.               If    the    curve    is
produced, it also meets the axis                   of y at the point              100,    which
simply means that the acid sulphate at infinite dilution                                is com
pletely decomposed           into free acid and neutral sulphate.

                   Sodium and Lithium            Acid Sulphates.
    On account of the close resemblance                of the alkali metals,         and
the general analogy which exists between their corresponding                      salts,
it was probable that the equilibria                in solutions containing         their
respective     acid sulphates would also be somewhat similar in                 nature.
This conclusion        is supported by the fact that the velocity constants
obtained for the corresponding solutions of sulphuric acid                     and the
sulphates of potassium,           sodium and lithium          are very     nearly     the
same, those for the sodium salt being somewhat                    higher than     those
for the corresponding potassium                salt solutions, and those for         the
lithium     salt   rather higher than either.            This simply       means    that
 the    percentage      of free acid in corresponding            solutions   increases
 slightly in the same order, or that most acid salt is formed                     when
 sulphuric acid is added           to a solution of potassium sulphate,              and
 least when added to a solution             of lithium    sulphate.       The   experi
 mental results were treated          exactly    as before,    and   I give therefore
 only the various tables for sodium and lithium                   sulphates.     These
 correspond      to the tables     given for the first series of         experiments
 with potassium        sulphate and sulphuric acid, and are arranged             in the

actually observed,               for example,            by calculating           the percentage          of
free acid which ought to exist in the various                                solutions and noting
the agreement             between this series of numbers with those found by

      The experimental results for solutions containing sulphuric acid
   and lithium sulphate were treated exactly as the preceding.                     The
   values of the constant       K   were first obtained by means of the same
   expression   with   the     same exponent, and from them a correcting
   factor determined       as before.      The value of the exponent y          in the
   latter  was   0-365,       practically     identical     with that     for sodium
   sulphate.    It   appears,      therefore,       that the    equilibrium   in    this
   case is represented       by an expression          of the same form and con
   taining the same exponents           as before.
      The next tables give all the data for the calculation of the                mo«?t
   probable value of the constant A,, which completely determinss
   the expression   for the equilibrium.

  It   may be said, then, as the result of                   all   the experiments and
the deductions from them, that the equilibrium between sulphuric

  where     % is equal to unity when           M is K, and equal          to 1*35 when
  M    is Na or    Li.    The constant       A  has a characteristic value        in  each
  case, and in the expressions         involving potassium, sodium, and lithium
  sulphates it is equal to 0-259, 0-0618, and 0-0600 respectively.
      The    expression      has    been deduced       quite empirically        from   the
 experimental results, and within               the   limits of the experiments it
 has been shown             to give results which         compare     favourably     with
 those actually observed.
      I hoped    to be able to extend this investigation             to determine the
 nature of the equilibrium in solutions of other acid sulphates, but
 did not      succeed     in finding     a  suitable indicator for the titrations,
 and     was therefore unable to measure the velocity constants.
      Using litmus as an indicator,           I  made a few determinations with
 solutions     containing sulphuric acid and ammonium sulphate, but
 the titrations       were     unsatisfactory and the results untrustworthy.
They       showed,      however, that sulphuric           acid has      less   action on
ammonium sulphate than on the sulphates                    of the alkali metals.

     It   appeared      from      a  few    measurements,       that the action of
sulphuric      acid is   still  less in the case of magnesium         sulphate.
     Ostwald      (Journ. prakt,         Ghent.,    1879,   xix. 483) determined
approximately          the   amount of free acid in solutions of some acid
sulphates       by their action on zinc sulphide.              Here, of course, the
equilibrium       is complicated and disturbed by the presence of foreign
substances, and although the results                differ considerably from those
I    have obtained,          their   arrangement in order of magnitude is
the     same.

   § 1.    For    a   perfectly        definite    mechanical      representation     of
Sellmeier's theory, imagine for each molecule                    of sodium-vapour       a
spherical hollow in ether, lined with a thin rigid spherical shell, of
mass equal      to the mass of homogeneous              ether which would till the
hollow.      This rigid lining of           the   hollow we shall call the sheath
of the molecule,       or briefly the sheath.           Within this put two rigid
spherical     shells, one inside           the   other, each     movable    and each
repelled from the sheath             with    forces, or distribution of force, such
that the centre of each is attracted towards the centre of the hollow
with a force varying directly as the distance.                    These suppositions
merely      put    two     of Sellmeier's         single-atom vibrators      into one
sheath.

sodium-vapour.           In   the first place, let the density of the vapour
be so    small that the distance              between   nearest    centres is great in
comparison with the diameter of each molecule.                        And in the first
place also,    lot us consider light whoso wave-length is very large in
 comparison     with   the distance        from centre to centre of nearest mole

dispersion by prisms of sodium-vapour,* by which                          I  was astonished

  k.    Taking     «, = () in (1), we see that the square of the refractive

  And remembering that the dark line or band extends through                           the
  range     of values    for which      (v,.!vs)2   is negative,    and that       (vjv,)2

   zero, as shown in the           table,   differs enormously       from      the curve
   shown on the positive side.               To the    degree of approximation to
   which we have gone, the portions of the intensity                     curve     on the
   left and right hand sides of the dark band are essentially                         equal
   and    similar.      This     proves     that so     far  as   Sellmeier's       theory
   represents    the     facts,   the   penumbras are        equal and similar            on
   the two sides of a single dark line of the spectrum uninfluenced

Note on Polarisation Phenomena observed in Quantitative
    Electrolytic Determinations. By Hugh Marshall, D.Se.
                                (Read March 6, 1899.)
    The phenomena         to which it is desired    to call attention were first
observed     in the course       of an investigation       into the electrolytic
methods of determining nickel, carried out in connection with                       the
work    of the British Association           Committee on the          Electrolytic
Methods of Quantitative Analysis.              The results of the investigation
are given in the Report of last               year's meeting       (Bristol,    ISi'-S
p. 300), but the present         matter is not referred to there,          as  it  was
first noticed only during the preparation of the report.
    The apparatus        employed for most        of the determinations           con
sisted of the usual Classen form of cathode basins, with disc anodes.
The current was drawn from storage batteries at                 12 volts, variable
resistances   being used in the circuits.         A Davies'     ammeter could be
introduced easily into any circuit at will, and              a  Davies' voltmeter
was    also   used     to   indicate   the   difference of       potential    at   the
electrodes.     These measuring instruments were             so arranged and con
nected     that the operation which introduced the ammeter                     into a
circuit simultaneously brought the voltmeter into action                 ; hence      it
happened that voltmeter readings               were   always taken conjointly
with ammeter ones, although attention was paid almost entirely                       to
the effects of varying the current density, and to any changes which
might occur during the course of the experiment, with no                      special
consideration of the potential involved.
    For   the determination        of quantities of nickel varying          between
0-l  and 0'5 gram, the conditions adopted             as most    generally   suitable
when employing the usual method were those given below : —
    Volume     of solution,     about 135 c.c. (giving about 100             sq. cm.
of cathode area), containing          5 grams    each of ammonium sulphate
and of ammonia       ;   current density at cathode (amp. per           sq. decim.),
O'G-0'7    ; ordinary temperature        ; time necessary,     about   4 hours.
    As   it was    found      that   the   method of testing for           complete
deposition of the metal by withdrawing              a  portion of the liquid       and

examining        it chemically          was    inconvenient     and     unsatisfactory,      a
considerable number of experiments had been carried out for the
purpose      of obtaining         an idea     of the time necessary for complete
deposition with varying current strengths and different quantities
of metal.        As   the    result of these, the above-mentioned limit of                   4
hours was fixed as sufficient, with                 the other conditions as stated,
while not unduly excessive for the smaller quantities of metal                          ;  the
time necessary        for complete        deposition is nothing like proportional
to   the amount of        Xi   present originally in the solution.
     The ammeter          readings      taken at intervals in the courso               of an
 experiment        kept      very    constant.       There     wore   slight     differences
 about the beginning, probably due                   to the change        of temperature
 caused by the current;             thereafter the readings          remained       constant
 for   a    considerable        time,    sometimes       until   the     experiment        was
 stopped, though generally there was a very slight falling off at the
 end,   but the total variation seldom                exceeded     about 0'03 ampere.
 On tabulating        and comparing a series of experiments in which the
 action     of the current had been continued for varying lengths of
 time, peculiarities were             unexpectedly       observed      in the voltmeter
  readings.      Here, again, there was always              a certain     variation at the
 beginning       of an       experiment,        then   a  period during          which     the
  difference of potential was practically constant, but, in some cases
  only, there was       a   considerable rise in the final reading, amounting
  occasionally     to  fully   0"5 volt    ;  in other cases there was no evidence
  of a distinct rise in the voltmeter readings.                  On further comparing
  the various experiments it was found that, as a rule, those belong
  ing to the second class were the determinations in which deposition
   had not been completed,            as evidenced      by   a somewhat low percent
   age  result and the presence              of small quantities of nickel in the
   decanted     liquid.       (The     latter    was   always     tested     by    means     of
   potassium     thiocarbonate.)          Those cases which showed                a   marked
   rise of potential        corresponded        to good    final results.
      These facts seemed to indicate that the removal of the last small
   quantities    of nickel from solution corresponded to                    a considerable
   increase in      the    resistance      between the electrodes.             The change
   could not     be caused        by diminished conductivity              of the solution,
   due   to  the removal of nickel, because of the                     large    quantity     of
    ammonium       sulphate        present,     and the     small quantity         of   nickel

involved.      It   could only be ascribed to an increase                   of polarisa
tion, similar       to   that    observed     in    the     electrolysis       of mixed
salts.
    By leaving the        ammeter     and voltmeter continuously in circuit
during several experiments, the progress of the change was studied
more    fully.     It  was found to take place            in a somewhat peculiar
manner.      The rise of potential began              very gradually, but before
long the     needle      sprang back to its former                position;     this was
followed by another slow, steady rise, again followed by a sudden
lapse.    These      changes      continued     for     some      time,   the    increase
becoming more and more marked, and the lapses gradually less and
less frequent, and finally the          instrument remained steady at about
 0-4-0'5   volt above the former level            ;   prolonged electrolysis had
 very little further effect, if any.
    In order     to test     the   value of this effect           as an indicator        in
 quantitative determinations, a number of experiments were carried
out with     varying       quantities    of nickel,      employing        the    methods
 already indicated, but stopping the electrolysis as soon as the volt
 meter   indicated that the potential had risen to the higher level,
 instead of waiting         the   standard time of          4   hours, as was done
 previously.      In every     case the results were quite satisfactory,               and
 were no lower than those obtained in duplicate determinations in
 which    electrolysis      was   continued      an    hour      or  two longer.         A
 selection of typical results is given below.

      It was next      sought    to get a more        accurate     idea of the actual
 quantity of nickel involved in causing the difference of potential;
 this was effected by adding a nickel solution of known strength to

 nickel.        In  some    experiments the         deposit   had been         previously
 washed        and dried in connection with             a quantitative experiment.
 In    these cases a solution of 5 grams              each of ammonium sulphate
 and ammonia was poured into the basin so as not quite to reach the
  edge    of the deposit,       and this was electrolysed for half-andiour
  before beginning the experiment proper.                  In other    cases   nickel was
  completely deposited from          a  solution in the ordinary way, and then
  the nickel solution of known             strength added without any further
  treatment.        The results obtained were             exactly alike in the two
  cases.      The nickel solution employed contained                11 m.g.    of  Xi.   per
  c.c., and one drop of         it corresponded approximately               to 0'45 m.g.
   It  was added drop by drop to the electrolytic solution, thoroughly
   mixed     with   the latter by blowing         gently through the liquid, and
   the effect noted.       The results obtained aro illustrated below.

      In  each of the above      experiments, electrolysis was continued             all
  night, so that it may be assumed that the nickel had been                       com
  pletely removed again when the readings were taken next morning.
  In other     experiments,   greater quantities of nickel, up to       20-30 m.g.,
  were added,       without producing any further appreciable change.
      These results seem to indicate that when the potential begins to
  rise in an ordinary determination, only two or three milligrams                     of
  nickel remain to be deposited.          The time necessary to effect this is
  out of all proportion, as may be seen by referring               to experiments
  I.-IV.      The current employed to eliminate              these  last   traces     is
  very greatly in excess of that theoretically               necessary,   and     it is
  therefore very questionable whether any advantage                  is secured     by
 increasing       the current towards the         end of an electrolysis, as is
 sometimes        recommended    ; the increased       escape of gas would         cer
 tainly have the effect of stirring up the liquid more, but probably
 a much better result would be obtained by diminishing the current
 and agitating the liquid.
      When small quantities of nickel          have to be determined, the pro
 portion of current wasted         becomes      greater,  and there is therefore
 greater risk of the deposit being affected by secondary actions               ;  and
 it  is precisely in such cases where        a  slight error, due to incomplete
 deposition on the one hand, or to impurity of deposit on the other,
 has to be specially guarded       against.      In  the Report already referred
 to,  it was therefore recommended          to employ small vessels and small
 volumes      of solution — other quantities being in proportion — when
determining small quantities of nickel,              as  better results are then
obtained, though the benefit is not nearly so marked in the case of
nickel     as   in that of cobalt.     The standard current density then
means a much diminished current strength, but, owing to the much
smaller volume of liquid from which the nickel has to be deposited,
deposition was shown to he completed                at least as soon as in dupli
cate determinations         on the larger scale.         By making      use of the
voltmeter        readings  as  indicator,    it   has   now been      shown by       a
number of experiments that the advantage                  is distinctly in favour
of the smaller vessel.        For   these experiments wide and somewhat
shallow platinum crucibles were employed,                with an anode of coiled
platinum wire.         The volume of solution was about 18 c.c, giving
about 25 sq. cm. of cathode          surface, which was one-fourth           of  that

 with    the large   basins,    although the volume was only about one-
 seventh.       Three-quarters of a gram each of ammonium sulphate
 and ammonia were added, and                a  current of 0-16 to 0"18 ampere
 employed.
     Duplicate determinations carried out in the two ways, with the
 same quantity of nickel, showed that deposition was always com
 pleted sooner in the          smaller vessel, despite           the feebler current,
 while the completion was indicated more clearly on account of the
 greater rapidity with which the rise of potential took place.                       The
 following     results were obtained with about 0"17                   gm.    of nickel
 ammonium sulphate in each case, corresponding to about 25 mg.
 of nickel.

    Experiments similar to V. and             VI., but with the smaller          vessels,
further showed that the actual quantity of nickel involved in
causing the change is less than with the larger volume of solution ;
as was to be expected, it is the strength of solution which deter
mines the effect,     so  that when the rise of potential sets in with an
experiment       on the smaller scale the quantity of nickel                 still to  be
deposited is only a fraction of what it is in the large apparatus.

  It     would appear,           from       the experiments above described,                     that
when the amount of nickel in solution is reduced to                               a   very      small
amount — say          1   part in about 50,000 — a film of some other                            sub
stance    is deposited,          giving       a    higher polarisation effect.            At     fir.4
this is replaced more or less by nickel, and occasionally                                     breaks
down,     as   shown by the lapses to the original potential, possibly                             on
account        of richer solution being brought against it by                          convection
currents,       but it ultimately                 becomes   permanent when the nickel
deposition is completed.                  As the deposition of nickel from ammo
niacal solutions must be            secondary action (the nickel forming
                                          a
part of        a   complex ion), it would probably be more correct to
assume the formation               of   a     film, other than nickel, from              the very
commencement              ;   owing to the nickel solution acting as                  depolarizer,
however, the polarisation effect duo to this primary deposit                                  is only
observable          when the layer of solution next the cathode                               is free
from nickel.           If     this is the case, it is probable that with                      a much
feebler     current density, the proportion of nickel remaining in                                the
bulk of the solution would                         fall still further before          the rise in
polarisation set in distinctly.
   The phenomenon, when observed,                           appears    to   be an inf illi'-e
indication of complete              deposition, but whether or not it                         may he
trusted to appear              in all   cases        remains to   be   seen   ;   probably        the
presence of certain substances                     may interfere and prevent            it.
   These experiments have been carried out simply from                                   the point
of view of the practical application to quantitative work,                                and
                                                                                                 it

that it was known to Prony in 1795 (see Journ. de TEc. Polyt.,
i. pp. 264, 265), and Cauchy in 1812 (see Journ.                        de   VEc. Polyt.,

    (3) When the symmetric function is non-linear, the result takes
the form not of one alternant, but of an aggregate of alternants.

     Now the required multiplication                is performed by adding each of
     these twelve sets of four           indices to           the indices 0              1 2    3 of     the
     multiplicand, the first index to the first, the second to the second,
     and so on, the product being the sum                      of twelve alternants whose
    indices are the indices resulting from the twelve additions.                                   It will
     be found       that   a  considerable number                 of the twelve alternants
    vanish by reason of the equality of two of the four indices, and
    that, in fact, we have finally
    | a°6W       \.2a3b = |a»6W4|           +    |oW|                + \aWc*cP\

        (4) The nature of this process is seen to be such that if we were
    told beforehand that | a°b2c3db ] was one of the alternants appearing
    in the expression of the product, and were asked                                 to find its co
    efficient,   we could do so only by finding                 all   the other alternants as
    well.     With     a view to ascertaining whether there is no exception
    to this, let us not use the multiplier                 as  it   stands, but take instead
    the expression for it in terms of 2a, 2a6, 2aic,                         . .   .   .    , viz.,

    On the Linear and Vector Function.                         By Prof. Tait.
                                  (Read May 1, 1899.)
                                       (Abstract.)
     Three      years   ago   I called the attention    of the Society to      the
following theorem : —
     The resultant of two pare strains is a homogeneous strain which
leaves three directions unchanged ; and conversely.
     [It will      be shown below that any strain which has three             real
loots can also be looked on (in an infinite number of ways)                     as
the resultant of two others which have the same property.]
     As    I  was anxious to introduce this proposition in my advanced
 class,    where    I  was not justified in employing      the extremely simple
 quaternion proof,        I  gave a number of different modes of demonstra
 tion   ;   of which the most elementary was geometrical, and was based
 upon the almost obvious fact that
     If    there   be two   concentric   ellipsoids, determinate in form ami
position, one of whicli remains of constant magnitude, while the
 other may swell or contract without limit ; there are three stages at
 uhieh they touch one another.
      [These are, of course, (1) and (2) when one is just wholly inside
  or  just wholly outside the other (that is when their closed curves of
  intersection      shrink into points), and (3) when their curves of inter
  section intersect one another.            The whole matter may obviously
  be   simplified     by first inflicting a pure strain on the two ellipsoids,
  such     as to make one of them into a sphere, next considering their
  conditions      of touching, and finally inflicting the reciprocal strain.]
      But the normal at any point of an ellipsoid is the direction into
   which the radius-vector of that point is turned by a pure strain ; so
  that    for any    two pure strains there are     three directions whicli they
   alter    alike.    (These form,      of  course, the    system  of   conjugate
   diameters       common to the two ellipsoids.)            This is  the  funda
   mental      proposition    of the    paper referred    to, and   the  theorem
   follows     from it directly.

548                  Proceedings                 of Royal             Society                 of Edinburgh.                         [~esa.
     In   the course of some recent                                   investigations                         I    noticed     that if 9
have real roots, so also has
vltatever           real strain            i/'   may         be.           This              is,   of course, obvious,                  for
they are         i/'a, >pfi, \py,      if        a,    /3,   y     be       the roots                   of       <f>.    At first sight
this appeared to mo to                           be    a     generalisation of the theorem above,
of   a     nature inconsistent with                                 some             of the steps of the                           proof.
But      it    is   easy to see that
                                                        it
                                                        is                 not       so.           For all expressions of
the form
correspond           to pure strains                  if     w   is   pure.                  Hence
and      is   thus, as required by the theorem,                                              the product of two                      pure
strains.
     Of       course      we might have                          decomposed                        it   into other            pairs      of
factors, thus

In   the former case                  the factors have                           each three                       real    roots,   in   the
latter they have not generally more than one.
     A    great number of curious developments                                                      at once suggest                them
selves, of which            I     mention one or two.
     Tims,       let there            be     three           successive                      pure       strains          (which may
obviously represent any strain).  We may alter them                                                                      individually,

the ahove    problem : —The relation between two strains (whether
with three real    roots or     with  one) when their successive      applica

    Eleven adult skulls from the Lushai-Chin              hill    tracts  were ex
amined   — nine of which    were those    of men, two of women.               Their
characters    and measurements        were    described in          detail.    Four
specimens were dolichocephalic, index below 75             ;   five were between
 75 and 77-5, and two from the South Lushai hill tracts were above
80  ; the mean of the series was 76-1.       When the two brachycephalic
skulls are excluded the mean index was 74-6,           so   that the people are
in the main dolichocephalic.        As  regards   the relation of length to
height the mean of the series was 73           8, and as a       rule the breadth
exceeded    the height.     Generally speaking the face was orthogna-
thous and       chamseprosopic,    the   nose was     mesorhine,         the orbit
was    megaseme,     and the palato-alveolar       arch     was     brachyuranic
The mean cubic capacity of the skulls of nine men was 1353 c.cm.,
the range being from 1270 to 1480.

      Eight skulls from           the Tonkal-Nilga             village of Hwining, about
forty miles north-east of Manipur,                        were     presented             by Lieut.-Col.
F. W. Wright.              They had been used by                    a     native     as     decorations
for his house, and each skull was enclosed                          in an open basket-work
frame     of split      cano.         Their characters and                  measurements                  were
described in detail.              The mean length-breadth index of the scries
was 76'4, and of these five, ranging from 72-5 to 75'3, may be re
garded as dolichocephalic, one was 77-l and two were brachycephalic.
In two specimens           the height slightly exceeded the breadth.                            The face
was orthognathous               and    chamseprosopic.             The nose was mesorhine,
the     orbit   megaseme,            and the palato-alveolar arch brachyuranic.
The cranial         capacity was unusually high for                       a savage         people, and
ranged       from      1455     to about 1000             in the men, with                  a   mean        of

      Travellers     in the hill ranges occupied                    by the Lushais (Kukis)
and     Nigds      have    recognised         differences      in the physical characters
of the       people.       There       is,   however,     a   general          opinion that their
narrow oblique            eyes, flat broad faces, high cheek bones, flat noses,
brown       skin of various          shades, straight black hair, scanty beard and
moustache          are Mongolian characters,               though Colonel Lowin states
that the type of feature of the Lushais                       is   not Mongolian, but more
like that of Portuguese                 half-castes.          If    the     Mongolian            typo of
feature be, however, that                    which   is   most      characteristic,             as   is    the
general      opinion,      it   is    interesting to note that                 it   is    associated        in
these     hill-men      with     a    form of skull         which         is   as   a     rule dolicho
cephalic or approximating thereto, instead of being brachycephalic,
 or    in the higher terms of the mesaticephalic group.
      Only one skull from the valley of Xepaul was examined, belong
 ing    to the tribe          of Magars        or    Gurungs, who have                     pronounced
 Mongolian features.                 Its cephalic index            was 90-5, strongly hyper-
 brachycephalic.           It   was     flattened     behind, probably from artificial
 pressure.
      The skulls from Burma were forty-four                        in number, the majority
 of    which, presented           by Surgeon-Major               George         Bell, bad died              as
 prisoners in the      jail   at Insein.       The mean index of length and breadth
 was above SO, so          that the general type was brachycephalic.                                 It   was
 exceptional to have          a   skull the height         of which was greater than the
 breadth.       In their facial relations they             were as      a   rule chama'prosopic,

was mesorhine,     the orbital index was mesoseme,         and the palato-
alveolar index    brachyuranic.       In their cranial capacity one was
only 1160 com., and three were exceptionally high, but as a rule
they ranged from 1240 to 1250 c.cm.
   Two of   the crania,  from an old cemetery in Upper Burma, were
distinctly dolichocephalic    ; one marked    Karen  was brachycephalic,
and the height was less that the breadth.           Two skulls were said
to be those of Shans, one was brachycephalic, cephalic index         80-6   ;
the  other was mesaticephalic, cephalic index          78-7.   They were
neither prognathic nor platyrhine.
   The Burmese are probably the descendants of a Himalayo-Tibetan
race, which migrated    in  a south-easterly direction until they reached
Burma.     They are of moderate      stature; the mean height of a num
ber of men measured      in the  jail at Insein was 5 ft. 2f in. The face
is broad and flattish, the nostrils spread out laterally, the eyes are
wide asunder and inclined to be oblique and almond-shaped.             The
hair is black and straight, abundant on the head, scanty on the face.
The skin is a light olive brown in the upper classes, but darker in
those who are more exposed to the sun.          The features show, there
fore, the Mongolian       type.    The Burmese skulls were compared
with Chinese and Siamese crania.         The paper concluded with some
remarks on the intermixture of races.

    The ten skulls to which           I  would direct attention this evening
 were collected in the island of New Guinea.                The first to come into
 my possession was given to me in 1895 by one of my pupils,                  Mr F.
N. Johnston,* the nine others              have been    recently purchased     from
dealers.      I  am   not able to name           the tribe or tribes by whom
 the skulls      had   been sculptured,        neither can    I state  the precise
locality at which they were obtained              ; but the dealer from whom       I
 bought eight specimens told me that they came from the Purari
River district.       This river      rises in the   range of the   Albert Victor
Mountains, and after a known course of 130 miles, it discharges
its waters by several mouths into the head of the great gulf of
Papua.t        It is said to be the largest river in the British territory,
next to the      Fly River.}

show           any     examples        of decorative sculpturing.
         Seven       of the skulls were those                       of men, one was              probably           a
woman,              and two           were    youths,         possibly girls,          about         15 or 16
years          of    age.      The      skulls    had obviously been preserved                           in    the
huts of the                 natives,     for they were               blackened with smoke.                      In
five         specimens        the      facial bones           had been          smeared         with     a    red
pigment.              Two crania         had      bunches of red grass tied around                             the
zygomatic arches.                    In all the        specimens,         with one exception,                  the
lower jaw was kept in place by                          a     band, formed sometimes                   of    split
cane, at others               of twisted vegetable                  fibre, which       had been         passed
through the nose, immediately above the floor, and carried                                               round
the hard             palate    and      symphysis menti, in front of the latter                                 of
which         it    was in most         instances secured by              a    knot.        Through          each
ascending             ramus     a     hole had been bored, and                   a    piece    of   split    cane
or   a       string of twisted vegetable                    fibre    had been passed through                   it,
and          secured      to the zygomatic arch (fig. 1).                      As     a   rule the          necks
of the teeth in each jaw were enclosed                                  in loops of string,             which
secured            them     together,     and     retained them            in their sockets.f                  In
some          of    the     skulls the teeth           were         in place and stained,               but    in
others          they had         to    some      extent dropped out or been                          removed,
and          pieces of wood or cane                   had been substituted for them,                         and
stained black like the teeth.

patterns which had been engraved on the frontal                          bone, and which
may be arranged conveniently in five groups.
       Group      1   was the most simple, and consisted               of straight incised
lines directed diagonally, and continued into each other at their
ends so as to provide a chevron or herring-bone-like pattern.                             This
mode of ornamentation                 was    present     in four crania.       In  three    of
these      it extended        across the frontal bone, from one temporal curved
line to that on the opposite side.                   In  one specimen three horizontal
parallel lines had been cut from one curved line to the other                           ;  the
lowest lino was 15 mm. below the middle one, and the highest
lino was         7   mm. above it (fig. 2).          Each interval contained several
diagonal lines, which passed alternately from left to right and from
 right to left, and formed            a complete       chevron pattern.      Immediately
 above each supraorbital ridge an incised line had been made, which
 accentuated           the projection of the ridge, and            the adjoining part of
 the     frontal bone had been scraped and polished.
       In  a second specimen          three similar parallel lines, at almost equal
 distances         apart, had been cut between               the   two temporal curved
 line3 ; in the upper interval twenty-nine incised lines were directed
 from       right     to  left, in the lower interval            seventeen    lines passed
 from left to right, and             to produce the         chevron pattern both sets
 of lines         were    required.      A chevron         figure,   which    consisted      of
 two       pairs of diagonals, had             also    been    scratched on the        upper
 part of the           frontal bone     (fig.   3).
       In  a   third    specimen    two parallel lines had been cut across the
  frontal       bone,     and   in the     interval     a  complete     chevron pattern,
 consisting         of fourteen diagonal            lines,  had been incised (fig. 4).
  Above the upper parallel line the arc of a circle had been cut, and
  its   concavity contained an incised figure, which consisted                        of two
  triangular        limbs, diverging upwards and outwards from                  a centre     in
   the   middle of the frontal bone.                Each limb showed         two pairs of
  incised lines, which met at their upper ends and                       enclosed    an un
   paired    central line.        The two limbs converged            below, and by their
   union      formed       an   enlarged      chevron      pattern.      In  the    interval
   between the two limbs two circles, one                   within   the other, had been
   cut.     This figure      was transitional        to the radiated designs       in group
    2.    In the fourth        specimen     no parallel      lines were cut across the
   frontal,      but about       midway      between the two temporal ridges a

chevron pattern, formed of three pairs of diagonal lines, had                  been
incised (fig. 5). Mr J. Y. Buchanan has told me that the chevron
zigzag is known to the natives of New Guinea as the snake
pattern, obviously from its undulations.
   Diagonal    lines,   running     in opposite    directions and      meeting     at
their ends so      as  to   form    a  zigzag   arrangement,     is evidently       a

     Group     2 consisted     of designs      in which limbs radiated from          a
common centre.           The most perfect pattern of this kind was found
in one of the young skulls, and consisted                  of four radiating limbs,
each about 30 mm. long (fig. 6).              One was directed upwards to about
an    inch from the bregma, one downwards to about the same distance
from the nasion, and the remaining two horizontally outwards, — one
in the direction of each temporal curved line.                  The common centre
from which the limbs proceeded                  was at about     the middle of the
 frontal bone, and was marked by two incised circles, one within
 the    other.     Each    limb     was triangular      in shape, and was differ
entiated from the bone            outside    it by an incised diagonal line on
 each side,     which met at the apex of the limb, whilst at the base
 the    boundary     line of one limb was continuous with that of the
 adjoining limbs.        Within this boundary line two              pairs of similar
 incised lines were present.
     In  a second     specimen      the radiated      figure   had only   three   tri
 angular limbs, the two longest of which                 were 22 mm. each.       One
 limb was directed downwards to the front of the glabella, and the
 others      downwards       and     outwards     towards     the  external   orbital
 processes.       The centre      of radiation     was    marked by two incised
circles, one within the other.             The boundary line of each limb in
 this specimen      enclosed     only   a single pair of incised lines.     Instead
of a fourth limb radiating upwards towards the bregma,                    a pattern,
 distinct from the radiated figure, had taken its place (fig. 7). It con
 sisted on each side of three incised lines placed one within the other,
 which, starting close together           from the external orbital process, ran
 upwards and inwards, to become continuous with each other in the
 middle of the frontal, the outermost line being prolonged upwards
  for 14 mm. beforo         it joined its fellow in         a point.    Immediately
  above    the  junction    three    short horizontal and two diagonal lines
  had been cut in the bone.             The radiated designs described in this
  group,    though quite distinctive, are in some respects affiliated to

the chevron pattern in Group              1 ;  for,  if we   trace the boundary      line
 of one limb, it forms a zigzag with that of each of the limbs continu
 ous  with its   base, and the radiated pattern of the one group may be
regarded as an extension and amplification of the chevron design.
    Mr Holmes, in his joint memoir with Mr Dorsey,                     figures several
radiated designs        on the crania in the          Field Columbia Museum in
Chicago, in some of which there were four limbs, in others three.
As   a  rule the radiations proceeded            from a centre marked by one or
two     incised circles.        "Whilst     the patterns included          within the
limbs in most         instances      did   not represent any definite natural
objects, in    a  few, especially those reproduced in figs.            7  and  8  of his
paper, they were without             doubt animal forms conventionally por
trayed.      Mr Holmes considers that              even    the simplest designs are
significant,     "being     totems,     or having their origin in the crude
mythologic conceptions of the people."
    It  is possible that the designer of these radiating patterns had
in his mind to delineate some natural object in                       a more     or less
conventional        way.      Professor       Haddon has drawn           a  number of
patterns,    carved on wooden belts from the                Gulf of Papua, in which
figures having         two,    three,    four, or even a greater number of
radiations     from     a  common centre have                been   sculptured.       He
regards these as degenerate             reproductions of the human face, and
speaks of the circle carved in the centre                  of each of the so-called
faces in his fig. 27 (p. 115)            as an eye inserted by the artist              by
mistake in the mouth.             It  is difficult   to put this interpretation on
the radiated figures          on the two skulls            described in this group,
in both of which circles corresponding                    to the so-called    eye were
sculptured in the common centre,                  which,     according to Professor
Haddon's view, would have                 to be regarded         as representing      the
mouth with the contained eye.                 We can scarcely suppose           that in
each of these skulls the artist had committed the error of inserting
an eye into the middle of the mouth, for the circles which                       he has
interpreted as representing it are obviously a part of the design,
and not an accident.*            We must look, therefore, for some other
interpretation of the radiated figure.                 If  it is to be regarded as a
   *
      It should  also be kept in mind that the inoised circles are not limited to
the above skulls, but are found in others where the general design              shows   a
different pattern. Possibly the circles may be intended, as in the hierogly-
phical writings of the ancient Egyptians, to represent the sun.

      Group      3.   Although     only one skull      belonged    to   this group, it
 was      in some respects          the most interesting       of the series, for it
 showed       a  decoration which bore         a  certain resemblance        to what is
 sometimes called the spectacle               ornament.*       This  design has been
 described as          a  double disc or circle, connected        by lines more       or
 less parallel, and is one of the best known                  sculptures on crosses
 and other carved             stones in Scotland, which        date from the early
 Christian period of Celtic art.
      In   the  Xew Guinea skull          the ornament was not arranged across
 the forehead,           but in the longitudinal      direction of the frontal arc,
 so that one disc was above the other.                The lower circle was placed
 33 mm. above the nasion.              It  was 18 mm. in diameter,       and enclosed
 a smaller circle, 8 mm. in ('iameter (fig. 8).                From the upper part
 of its    circumference       two almost parallel lines,      19 mm.    long, passed
 upwards to join the upper circle, which                     had almost the same
 diameter       as  the lower.      It presented,  however, this peculiarity, that
 at the upper part the boundary line from the opposite                   sides of the
 circle did not become continuous, so that the circle was incomplete
above, but         it  enclosed   a   smaller circle.     The ornament was sur
rounded by           a   wavy line, and whore it was opposite            the    parallel
lines connecting the two discs, straight incised lines from 4 to 6
mm. long were directed inwards.                   External    to this another wavy
line enclosed the whole design.               The outermost line had been cut
across the glabella and supra-orbital               ridges below, whilst above        it
 was involuted, passed through the interval between                  the incomplete
parts of the          upper circle, and was continued into the boundary
line of the enclosed smaller circle.             Within     the external boundary
line    and immediately above the glabella and supra-orbital ridges
a    wavy incised line followed the outline of the ridges, and five
short incised lines were directed upwards from it.

 circles connected         by an intermediate transverse band is the nearest
approximation to the design carved                    on   the skull which            I   have
 described.        Br Joseph         Anderson,       in   discussing       the     spectacle
ornament        sculptured       on the      Scottish     Stones in Ancient             Celtic
Times, is distinctly of opinion that this symbol was Christian                              and
not pagan.          It   is therefore very interesting            to find    that    a figure
possessing       somewhat similar           characters     had been designed by                 a
pagan artist as far away from Scotland as                     New Guinea.             We      do
not know the meaning which had been attached to these symbols
by those who had engraved them either on the stones or on the skull,
but of this     we may be sure, that they had not the same significance
io  the Celtic Christian         and the     Xew Guinea         savage.
    Group     4 was     represented by only one skull.                The design       was of
large size, and was broadly ovoid in its general                       form.      Its   upper
limit   reached     to 13 mm. from the bregma,               the lower      limit    touched
 the   upper part of the glabella, and each lateral boundary                                was
about    12 mm.      from the temporal curved line on the frontal                        bor.e
(fig.   9).    The design was fairly symmetrical,                    and contained          five
Bines concentrically         arranged.       The lines were not prolonged               across
 the   glabella, but the outermost and the third line on                          each      side
 became continuous below in a point at the inner end of the supra
 orbital ridge, and          a  similar     arrangement        was    present with           the
 fourth and fifth lines.             The second       concentric line occupied               the
 middle of the interval between               the   outermost and the third              lines.
 The space enclosed           by the fifth line was an elongated                   ovoid,     50
 mm.      in   longitudinal        and    28   mm.      in   its    greatest     transverse
 diameter.        A    chevron      pattern     had been       cut in     the     enclosure,
 about one-third from the upper end                  was a ring-like        figure, 5 to        6
 mm. in diameter,          and at the lower end opposite points of the                     fifth
 line   were     connected       by    a   shallow     zigzag     line.   The       intervals
 between     the first, second, third, and fourth              lines were occupied            by
 chevron patterns.             One cannot         identify     this    design with          any
 natural object.          It may be regarded as a rude geometric pattern,
 though the zigzags gave it the snake-like undulations referred toby
 Mr Buchanan, and            associate   it with the     designs in Group 1.

     Group 5 possessed two representatives.                As   the most character
istic   was described by me in           April 1898,*    I need     only briefly refer
to its    design.     The area occupied by the sculpture was 71 mm.
in   transverse and      61   in vertical diameter.         It  was bounded by an
incised line, which           passed     horizontally    across    the glabella and
supra-orbital      ridges, and curved upwards, so that its summit was
 35 mm. from the        bregma.         It  enclosed  a figure which was a rude
representation of       a face    engraved upside down (fig. 10).               Two   eyes
 and   a pair of eyebrows were immediately above the glabella                     ; a long
 straight nose, upper and lower lips, an open mouth, a series of
 short incised lines to represent teeth, and a tongue were recognis
 able.     On each side of the face an elongated,                    curved, limb-like
 object had     been sculptured, and from the outside line of enclosure
 n number of short lines were directed inwards towards the central
 figure.
     In my original description of this              specimen      I   referred to the
 descriptions     and figures in          Professor Haddon's          treatise    on   The
 Decorative      Art of New Guinea, which              showed      that the Gulf of
 Papua was the district in which the human face or designs derived
 from it    seemed to be         most    frequently   employed        as   an ornament
 on the articles which they manufactured, and                 I  called attention to
 a   face   depicted on a belt in the Berlin Museum                         (p.   115)   as
 approaching in design to that sculptured on the forehead of this
 skull.
     The second specimen in this group has only recently been acquired.
  At the first   glance    it   seemed as     if it would appropriately fall into
  the radiated pattern of Group 2, but a more complete                      examination
 showed important           differences.         The  design     consisted       of three
  limbs,   two of which, broadly             triangular in shape, were directed
  horizontally outwards immediately above the glabella, towards the
  external orbital      processes.        The third    limb,    28 mm.         long, and
  directed upwards, sprang from the upper part of the horizontal limbs
  at their junction in the middle of the frontal (fig. 11).               It  terminated
  40 mm. from the bregma             in  a  club-like dilatation, in the centre of
  which   a  circle from     6   to   7 mm.     in diameter had been cut.              Be
  tween the circle and         the outer boundary line an inner faint line,
  which followed the curve of the latter, was incised.                        Extending

across the front of the bone and in the middle of the                        horizontal
limbs was      a series     of incised denticulations            enclosed     within      a
faintly incised line.       This design differed from          the radiated pattern
in the shape of the three limbs, more especially the ascending, and
in the absence of      a  circle or circles at the centre of radiation.                 By
the exercise of one's imagination one could conceive                    the club-like
limb to be a head, and the circle within              it  to be a cyclopian           eye,
 whilst the short denticulations might represent the teeth contained
within    an open mouth.
    It is well known that the art of designing is exercised                  by people
 who, in many other respects, are primitive                   in their habits         and
 mode of thought.         The possession of this faculty is found in the
 Bushmen and the aboriginal Australians,                as   well as in the races
of Polynesia.       If   we go back to prehistoric           times     in Europe we
 find that palaeolithic        man    portrayed      on     his    implements         and
 weapons     faithful    representations of the          animals that were              co-
 temporaneous      with     him,   so   that   the   artistic     faculty     appeared
early in the evolution of the human intelligence.                     One is struck,
however, in the study of the decorative art of Xew Guinea, with
 the conventional      character of the patterns and with the variety
of design displayed          by the native, artists.           In   the    skulls    now
before    me, as well as in those          described by Messrs Dorsey and
 Holmes, no two patterns are exactly alike, and the artist in each
case had not copied          either his previous productions, or those                   of
his fellows, but had followed            the bent of his imagination.
    From the appearance         presented     by the designs,       as is  well shown
in figs.  3  and   5, it is evident that they had not been                  cut in the
bone by a sharp instrument, such             as would be used by a European
engraver, but had been scratched or scraped by a more primitive
tool, made probably from          a piece   of shell.
    The question      may    now be considered whether                 the    decorated
crania were those of relatives or of enemies.                With     one exception,
no skulls     were fractured, or otherwise injured, as if from blows
received    during life.      Ample    evidence    is given by travellers            that
the    people    of Xew        Guinea     attach    much        importance       to    the
preservation of human crania in and adjacent to their houses,
although the practice of sculpturing             designs     on the frontal         bone
seems to be confined to a comparatively small area.                       The famous

 1898-99.]    Sir W. Turner on Sculptured Shdls, New Guinea. 563
 traveller and missionary, the Rev. James Chalmers,*                    stated   that
  at Teste Island,     off the south-east     point of New Guinea, the chiefs
 had skulls on the posts of their houses which they               Slid  belonged   to
 enemies      they had killed and eaten.            In another village, skulls
 said to be those         of eaten enemies        were   hung about the house
 of the chief man, and the war canoe was decorated                    with painted
 skulls.      One of the guides      to the village wore as an armlet the
 jawbone of a man he had killed and eaten, whilst others had human
 bones     attached   to the hair and neck.        The people bury their dead
 relatives, and place houses over the graves.                 Mr Chalmers        says
 that the inhabitants        of the inland villages in the Aroma district
 cook the heads of the slain enemies to secure clean skulls to put on
 sacred places.       At Maiva, in     the   Gulf of Papua, numerous human
 skulls were suspended         from  a  pole close to a temple or dubu.          The
 Rev. W. Wyatt Gill, in the same volume, wrote that he saw at
 Hula, in Hood Bay, a widow carrying about in a basket the skull
 of her deceased husband. He stated that at Suau, near the South
 Cape, the dead are buried in           a  shallow grave in a sitting posture,
 with   an earthen pot covering the head.              After   a time the pot is
 removed and the skull cleansed, to be eventually hung up in the
 house in a basket or net over the fire,           so  as  to become     blackened
 with   smoke.       The Suau people also eat their enemies                and pre
serve the       skulls,   and trade       amongst     each   other    with     them.
^Nothing      is said by these authors of designs           being sculptured on
any of these crania.          Sir Win. Macgregor       figures  t  a native house
on Dobu, one of the D'Entrecasteaux                 group of islands, in front
of which       was a ledge covered        with human skulls.         It  is obvious
that   the practice of preserving human              skulls   in and about the
native houses applies both to those of relatives and of enemies slain
in battle.
    In addition    to the study of the decorative features of these crania,
I  have examined them in order to determine their race characters,
and   I  append in Table I. the measurements               which    I  have   made.
The general form of         the skulls, a3 seen in the norma verticalis, was
thit of     an elongated     ovoid.    With two exceptions        the crania were

1898-99.]     Sir W. Turner on Sculptured Skulls, New Guinea.                       565
not ridged in       the sagittal line, and the slope         outwards to the parie
tal    eminences was not steep.              In  most of the crania the greatest
•width      was in the       parietal region, near the eminences,              and the
sides of      the crania were almost vertical             below these projections.
The skull       was not flattened        in the parieto-occipital region, except
in    one specimen, in which the length-breadth index was                    77*1 .  In
the nine other crania the index ranged from                  68 to 75-7, so that the
 crania were of the dolichocephalic character,                 and the mean of the
 enti  re series was   7 2 -6.   In five crania the height exceeded the breadth,
 in one     these diameters        were   equal, in four the breadth somewhat
 exceeded the height           ;  the mean vertical     index was 73-8.           In all
 the crania, with        one exception, the parietal longitudinal               arc was
 longer than either the frontal or occipital. In the dolichocephalic
 form and proportions, in the height being frequently greater than
  the breadth, and in the dominancy of the parietal longitudinal arc,
  the skulls possessed Melanesian character;).
      The norma facialis showed in the male skulls a moderately pro
 jecting glabella and supra-orbital ridges, a forehead not specially
  retreating, no great depression            at the nasion, nasal        bones   moder
  ately projecting with the osseous bridge concave,                     anterior nares
  moderately wide and with               a   mean   nasal   index 50.       The nasal
  process of the superior         maxills    was moderate    ;  the floor of the nose
   was continued into the incisive region of the upper               jaw without the
  intervention of a sharp ridge, except in the skull with the higher
   cephalic   index (No. 2 in Table I.), in which also the jaw was
   orthognathic ; in almost all the other crania the upper jaw was
   distinctly prognathic, and the mean gnathic index was 104-7.                     The
   width of the orbit did not, as          a rule, greatly preponderate over the
   height, and the mean           index 86 was mesoseme.            In several skulls
   the palato-alveolar       arch was proportionately           long and the mean
   index was     1 10*6, just above       the dolichuranic       group.    As regards
   the  proportion of the face generally, obtained by taking the pro
   portion   of the interzygomatic breadth to the nasio-montal length,
   the mean complete        facial index was 84*1, which places them in the
    chaniseprosopic or low-faced group of Kollmann.
      The cubic capacities         were   measured    by my assistant,      Mr James
    Simpson, in accordance         with the method which          I recommended in
    my Report on the Human Crania {Challenger                Reports, Part     XXIX.,

 566                   Proceedings           of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                                    [sess.
 1884). The mean of the seven adult male skulls was 1245 c.cm.,
 whilst the single skull of an adult female was 1 150 c.cm.
        The relatively small cranial capacity, the prognathic upper jaw,
 the mesoseme                    orbit, the mesorhine nasal region, associated,                             it may
 have been, with the prominent nose so frequently                                              described in       the
natives of the south coast of New Guinea, are all conformable with
 Melanesian characters,                      and conjoined with those already referred
to as existing in the cranium                               proper, justify one in saying                        that
these people belonged to the Melanesian                                    race.        It   seems, however,
not improbable that skull No.                           2   in Table       I. may have             been due to
an intermixture                   of another race, for it was definitely mesaticephalie,
the         jaw   was orthognathous, the nose was leptorhine, and the orbit
was niegaseme.
        The series of sculptured skulls described by                               Mr Dorsey             were also
dolichocephalic                   in their     length-breadth              proportions.              They        also
belonged           to the          Melanesian race, and it is not unlikely that they
may         have       been       collected in or near the district watered by the
Purari river.
     The Anatomical Museum of the University contains, in addition
to the skulls                above        described,        several       specimens,           none of which
had designs                engraved        on them, from the south coast                           or the     east
point of Xew Guinea, some of which                                    I   have     described elsewhere.

cephalic         skull from Port Moresby,                           which was presented                  by L)r
Lamrock.
      Subsequently to the               last date,             I    am      indebted to Mr AV. E.
M'Farlane             for four skulls         from Kwato,*                    near     Dinner        Island,    a
little to the east of the South Cape                       ;   and to Mr D. C. L. Fitzwilliams
for a skull from Geelvink Bay, in the Dutch settlement in the north
west of the island, said to have belonged                                to the Wandessie tribe.
      The skulls from Kwato were from the same locality.                                             They are
all    adult, — two           males,    and         two apparently                  females.         The   base
around          the foramen         magnum           had       been broken, probably to assist
in the removal of the brain, or perhaps                                for room to receive               a pole.
In     three         crania   so    much      had      been         destroyed          that the internal
capacity,            basi-bregmatic height, and                      several        other measurements
could not be taken.                  The lower jaw was absent in each specimen.
      One       male and one female                  skull,         when seen from the norma
rtdkalu,             were     ovoid in shape, and had dolichocephalic                                    propor
tions,         the    mean     length-breadth              index         of the         two being          7_'0.
The height could be measured                          only in the male, and it exceeded
the breadth by 10 mm.                      In   the male             the parietal longitudinal                 are
exceeded the frontal, but the opposite                               condition was present in the
woman's          skull.       In   the man the upper                   jaw       was prognathic, index
105-2 ;         the nasal          index    was       mesorhine,              the     orbital    index      was
almost in the mesoseme group,                         and          the palato-maxillary              index was
in the lower term of the mesuranic                                 group.        The characters          of this
skull were definitely Melanesian, and those of the woman were in
the    main in the same category.
      In   the other two crania the breadth was proportionately greater,
so    that the man's skull had                  a   cephalic index               77   '2,   and the woman's
81-2.           In the        man      the parietal longitudinal                       arc     exceeded        the
frontal, in the woman the opposite                                  condition was            seen.       Neither
 showed any indication of parieto occipital flattening.                                          In both       the
 nasal bones            were       depressed         at the          nasion   ;     they had         a   concave
 bridge, their projection                  forwards was feeble, and the nasal index
 was  leptorhine.  The incisive region of the upper jaw inclined very

 1698-99.]    Sir W. Turner on Sculptured Skulls, New Guinea. 569
recorded of an intermixture                 of races in the eastern part of the
south coast of New Guinea.
    The skull of the native of the Wandessa tribe from Geelvink
Bay    was that of an adult             male.    In its   appearance    and    general
dimensions it was on           a  larger scale than the skulls from the south
coast of the island, and had belonged                  apparently to     a   well-built
man.       In   the norma verticalis it was an elongated           ovoid with steep
side walls.        The length-breadth index was dolichocephalic, 70"2,
the    basi-bregmatic        height       exceeded    the    breadth,   the parietal
longitudinal       arc was much longer than the frontal and the occipital,
and in all these characters             it possessed Melanesian features.          The
glabella      and supra-orbital ridges were             distinct, the nasal bones
were short, narrow, only slightly projecting, the nasal index was
leptorhine, the floor of the nose passed smoothly into the incisive
region of the upper jaw, which was mesognathous.                       The face was
high in relation        to the interzygomatic        breadth, and came into the
leptoprosopic group of Kollmann.                   The palato-alveolar arch was
elongated and of dolichuranic                proportions.    The internal capacity
of   the    cranium       was    considerable, so that the skull            was   meso-
cephalic.
    MM.      do Quatrefages         and Hamy       have described     in their great
work * four        ttkulls of natives of the Wandessa tribe, to which this
skull   was also said       to belong.        Three males gave a mean length-
breadth index 69*9, whilst the length-height index was 73-5; the
height,     therefore,    exceeded       the breadth.      In  a female    skull, how
ever, the length-breadth              index was 77*7.         Notwithstanding      this
exception, the cephalic index in the Wandessa tribe would seem
generally to be dolichocephalic.                In the magnificent series of 135
crania     collected    by  Dr    A.  B.   Meyer,t 23 from Rubi on the main
land    at the head        of Geelvink        Bay, and 112 from Kordo, in the
island of Mysore, at              the mouth of the bay, the majority              were
dolichocephalic,        several     were niesaticephalic, and only a small pro
portion were brachycephalic. In no specimen of this large series
did there appear to be any decorative sculpturing on the skull, and
as the crania from the south-east               part of the island were also free
from carving, it       seems as      if   the practice were in a great        measure,

Papua.
    No skull described in this communication                 was metopic.       In    two
skulls     a   broad tongue-like          process    of   the  squamous      temporal
reached the frontal, and cut off the ali-sphenoid from the parietal.
In   three specimens         there were epipteric bones.           Four skulls       had
small Wormian bones in the lambdoidal suture, in                    a fifth specimen
a large    triquetral bone was situated in the right half of the suture.
One skull had a third condyle.               In  several skulls the inner      wall     of
the orbit was broken, but in               the uninjured      specimens     the smaK
size of the os planum             of the ethmoid was noted, and in one of
these    I   observed     this plate to be triangular in form, and               that    a
tongue-shaped        process of the orbital plate of the superior              maxilla
intervened between the             os  planum and lachrymal and articulated
with the frontal.           Some years ago     I   figured this variety in a Bush
man's     skull (pi.     1,   fig. 4,   Challenger Reports, 1884), and          I   have
since seen it in the skull of a man from the Lushai                    Hill tracts      to
the north of Burma.               It  is obviously a rare      variety even      in   the
crania of savage races.
    Through the courtesy of Dr A. B. Meyer of Dresden,                     I  received
on   July    19th a valuable and interesting memoir,              "On    the  distribu
tion of the Negritos in the Philippine Islands and elsewhere," *
which he has recently published.                  In   the course of this Memoir
 he discusses      the question       of the characters of the people of New
 Guinea;      is this island, he says, inhabited            by a uniform race, the
 Papuan, or is the Papuan             a  mixed race     ?   Especially, do Negritos
 exist in New Guinea by the side of, or amongst the Papuan popu
 lation, and can Negritos be racially distinguished from Papuans!
 In reply     he regards the Negritos and Papuans as one race,                    which
 exhibits considerable           variability  in its physical characters.            The
 differences     in the form of the skull and the stature do not weigh,
 he says, against the uniformity in so many other respects, and it is
 not necessary        to    look upon brachycephaly            and dolichocephaly
 as   constant factors         in the determination         of racial features.        He
 assumes       that   certain races vary more in this character than in
 others.      In  the course of his argument he refers to my description

   marks     greater than        I   intended to convey,           for though       I   referred
   to the    opinion of de Quatrefages                and    Hamy,       I did not commit
   myself     to   the     view       that    brachycephalic          crania    collected     in
   New      Guinea    were     necessarily       or exclusively         Xegritos   ;    nor did
  I   cite   any    of the      brachycephalic          crania which         I  had      person
  ally     examined       as   those      of Negritos.         I   did, indeed,        say  that
  the    island    was     on    the west       brought into relation with brachy
  cephalic,     short-statured          Xegritos,     and    also     with brachycephalic
  Malays;      whilst on the east, colonies of brachycephalic Polynesians
  bad    reached it from the Louisiade Archipelago;                       so that it was not
  unlikely that an intermixture of foreign and                        native elements had
  occurred.       I   gave    I)r Meyer        as  an authority for the intermixture
  of .Malays     and Papuans on Waigiou and the smaller Papuan islands
  to the    west of New Guinea.
     The observations of              Mr Dorsey       on the sculptured skulls in the
  Museum        at Chicago,         and     those   sculptured crania which              I  have
  described     in this article, do not support the presence of                       a  brachy
  cephalic     people     indigenous to the districts where these skulls were
 collected.       Eight adult male skulls in the Dorsey collection had
 a mean      length-breadth index 71, and the index ranged from 65 to
 "i;     seven adult        female      skulls had     a mean        index 73, and ranged
 from 65 to 77,          whilst in the skull of        a  child the index was 7S.             In
 my series       of ten skulls,          as has    been stated        on p. 563, the mean
 length-breadth          index was 72'6 and the range was from 68 to 77'                       1.
 Xo skull was brachycephalic, or in the upper terms of the mesati-
cephalic group.            If   the relatively higher index had been the only
feature      of the mesaticophalic cranium,                I   should not have regarded
it as     in itself expressing          a  racial difference,       but it varied from the
other adults in the proportions of                     the nose and          orbits, and the
upper       jaw   was orthognathic             (see p. 566).        In    several    important
respects,      therefore, it differed from the Papuo-Melanesian                            type.
Not unlikely         its characters may be owing to                a crossing of a      Papuan
with an individual            of another race, who had been captured                     in war,

The Propagation of Earthquake Vibrations through the
            Earth. By Professor C. G. Knott, D.Sc.
        Address delivered   at the request of the Council,     July   10,  1899.
                                    (Abstract.)
   The history of soismological        research     and discovery may be con
veniently    divided     into   three great       epochs.         1.  We      have   the
recording    of earthquakes in the popular significance of the term,
with an enquiry into their character, based almost entirely upon
the (usually)     destructive results of their visitation.                2.   We find
investigators beginning to appeal          to experiment           to elucidate some
of the effects noticed, with a growing appreciation of the necessity
of recording    all palpable earthquakes,         whether destructive or not.
One    of the   most   honoured names         in this connection is that of
Mallet, whose       two volumes       on   " The Great Neapolitan                Earth
        " form    a classic    in the literature of the subject.                Most of
quake
the developments of recent times           will   be found       in embryo in the
pages   of this monumental work.             3.   The introduction            of instru
ments for recording earthquakes, and,            as a  natural consequence,          the
recognition    of pulsations and       tremors and        the      various kinds       of
earthquake too feeble to be detected by our senses.
   At every    stage in this history, geological and physical problems
of intrinsic difficulty       have been     encountered       ;   and it is to the
discussion of some of the most recent of these that this address is
devoted.
   From    the days of       Mallet and Hopkins,           numerous reports on
earthquakes and seismological phenomena                have     been prepared and
published by the British Association           ;  and the last of these, from
the   industrious    pen    of  J.  Milne,   F.R.S., formerly Professor of
 Mining in    the   Imperial     University      of Japan,        has   a    surpassing
 wealth of detailed        facts and of suggested           theories.         And yet,
 before this report was issued in printed            form, the careful scrutiny
 of tremor records      had led Professor         Milne   to the evolution of an

 574          Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                     [ses.
 altogether novel idea,         which may possibly throw light on                    that
                              —
much-debated problem the internal constitution of the earth.
    Whatever      may be the specific         cause of any particular             earth
quake, there must be at its source a disturbance or abrupt                      change
in the configuration of the material of the earth's crust                  A   rupture
or dislocation occurs, and outwards, in all directions, a disturbance
is propagated,       accompanied       by rupture    or dislocation in nearer
regions,   by vibrations, clastic and quasi-clastic, in these and in               more
distant regions.        For    the  study of the non-destructive vibratory
accompaniments of earthquakes, seismologists             have invented various
forms of seismometer         or seismoscope.
                                                                    '
    The essential     feature of all seismometers        is the        steady point.'
A   mass is adjusted, by means           of various devices, so as to remain
steady although its supports move              with the ground.           A   style or
pen    attached    to this steady      body is arranged so            as  to make        a
tracing on     a surface     fixed to the moving ground.
    To register small earthquakes, it           is advisable to have a multi
plication of the relative motion of earth and steady body,                      so that
the   records   may be studied to advantage.             In Yicentini's       form of
seismograph,      the   motion is magnified 100-fold by means                  of   two
delicately-poised levers.          The record is made by       a  light    glass fibre
resting against      a smoked surface.         The same method of recording
is adopted in other delicate          Italian instruments,      such as Cancani's
horizontal pendulums at Kocca di Papa (Rep. B.A., 189S,                      p. 266).
    In his own form of horizontal pendulum, Milne                      uses a photo
 graphic    method      of   recording     the motion      of   the end of            the
 horizontal boom which bears the approximately steady body,                          and
 which is made to have a very long period by being attached                         by a
 tie to a point nearly vertically above the point on which the boom
 pivots.    Darwin's delicate bi-lilar        suspension    and other forms             of
 'tromometer'      and horizontal pendulum, though intended primarily
 for other purposes,       may also be classified as seismometers.
    The delicacy of        a  seismometer     varies with     the     function it        is
intended to perform.             The instrument      intended        to detect        and
 record minute movements which do not affect our senses must                            be
 much more       delicate than the instrument whose              function       it  is to
record veritable earthquakes in the popular significance of the                    term.
 The greater      the distance from the source            at which we          hope to

189S-99.]          Prof. Knott on Earthquake Vibrations.                           575
detect     seismic movements,         the more delicate the instrument            must
be; and,       as   pointed    out by Milne in         1883    (see   Earthquakes,
p. 226),     the    detection of vibrations         which   have    come     from an
earthquake occurring           at   the   other side of the earth is           a  mere
question      of having sufficient,!}' delicate instruments.            It  was not,
however,      till  1889   that    a   record taken in Europe was identified
with an       earthquake      occurring     in Japan.      At   the   present     time
Milne obtains at his seismological            observatory in the Isle of Wight
some     70 records per year of vibrations which have travelled over
or through the earth from true earthquake origins.
   These records of vibrations having             a true earthquake origin have
certain characteristics which            at once distinguish     them from other
types    of tremors     and   oscillations recorded from time to time.                It
is  generally possible       to   distinguish    in each seismogram          two and
perhaps three types of vibration.              There is first of all      a series    of
small motions or tremors;             and after these have lasted         for it may
be 20     or 30 minutes, much larger motions assert themselves,                     and
these gradually die away into a series of small tremors again.                     It  is
usual to call the first set of small motions the Preliminary                 Tremors,
and the subsequent           larger motions the        Large Waves.           It  must
be   remembered, however, that               the so-called    Large Waves         have
no effect      on our senses, and are large only when compared                     with
the preliminary         tremors;       also that the    term    'preliminary'       has
reference      simply to the fact that the tremors               come    first to the
front.      Exactly similar          tremors may      continue     throughout       the
 whole disturbance.         (See    B.A. Import,     1898, pp. 208-218.)
    On the assumption that this type of motion has come from an
 earthquake origin, the conclusion is inevitable that the Preliminary
 Tremors have outraced           the Large Waves.         As   a general      rule, the
 interval of time between the first appearances              of the Tremors and
 Large Waves increases            with the distance of the earthquake origin
 from the place whore the record is taken.               In  the   B.A. Report for
  189S (pp. 222-3)       Milne    has given interesting details in this connec
 tion.    In considering    these, we must bear in mind that all the records
  were not made with          the    same type of instrument,        and that con
  sequently     the  comparison of intervals can be only approximate.
  Still, there is not more discrepancy among               the   results   as a  whole
  than among the results obtained at any one place, and                  presumably

576                  Proceedings          of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                                      [srss.
with     the        same        instrument.            There is       a    clear indication that the
preliminary tremors outrace                           the large waves by intervals                       of    time
which are proportional                    to the arcual distances between the plica
where the record is taken and the                                  place        where the earthquake
shock is most              violent — or,        what amounts to very nearly the                               same
thing, proportional to the average depth of the chords connecting
these places.
     Again, from            a   knowledge of the instant at which the earthquake
really      occurred,            the    approximate              times      of propagation               of the
preliminary              tremors and of the large waves can be calculated.
     From           the    data        given     by      Milne       I     have deduced             a     simple
formula * for             the speed of propagation of the preliminary                                    tremors
in terms of the average depth of chord, on the assumption that                                                  the
line of propagation is that of the chord.                                  It   is
                                               t?2   = 2-9 + -026tf,
where       v   is      the speed in miles per second,                     and       d   the average depth
of chord in miles.                  Expressed in kilometres, the formula                                becomes
                                               p2    = 7-5   +   -042dt.
     For    large depths of chord, this formula approximates to Milne's
own statement               that the speed varies as the square root of                             the depth
of chord.
     When           a   like calculation        is    made for the larger waves, the sp'eJ
is   found to be practically constant for arcual distances greater                                             than
60", its value being 1'7 miles per second.
     The formula just given may be used to obtain an approximation
to the      form of the wave-front of simultaneous disturbance                                                 as   it
passes through                  the earth.           The problem, mathematically                    stated,          is
similar in essence to finding the wave-front in                                      a   crystal, the         differ
ence being that in the optical problem the speed of propagation                                                  has
a    value depending on certain directions in the crystal and                                            is   other
wise the same at every point,                           whereas          in the present problem                  the
speed depends               on the distance from the earth's centre.

any vibration            are at   right angles            to the    wave-fronts and can be
straight lines only when these are spherical, that                              is,   when the speed
is   constant at all depths.              If   the    speed increases             with nearness to
the centre, the paths             will    be convex towards the centre.                           In this
case      the true average speed will be somewhat greater than the value
obtained by dividing                length of chord by the time taken.                             Until
many more observations have been accumulated,                                   it    would probably
be    a   waste of labour to attempt any better approximation to the
law of propagation of seismic                     disturbance through the earth.                     The
mathematical difficulties are considerable, and wc can hardly hope
for other than approximate solution of the problem.
      The      speed of propagation                 of an elastic          wave        depends     on     a
particular coefficient of elasticity and on the density of the material.
Assuming — and this seems                      the most plausible               assumption — that
both types of waves travel                     by   brachistochronic            paths through the
earth, we conclude that, since the density                         is    the same       in   both cases,
the coefficients           of elasticity must be influenced by the depth in
quite different           ways.     The density           is    known     to increase         with    the
depth      ;   and various formula?               have     been         given     by different          in
vestigators.           For ordinary        purposes,        where no depths greater                  than
 2000 miles are considered,                we may use the formula,
                        density   = 2-75      +   '0028 x depth in miles,
 which agrees very closely with Laplace's historic formula.
      In other words,         the    density may be assumed                     to increase by          ;'l7
 per mile descent, or "28 per cent.                   The coefficient           of elasticity which
 determines the propagation of the larger waves                           will therefore        increase
 at    nearly the same rate, whereas the coefficient of elasticity which
 determines          the propagation of the preliminary tremors                          will   increase
 at the rate         of nearly    1"2 per cent,        per mile descent.
      These results seem to have               a    distinct bearing upon               the     question
 of   the internal condition of the earth.                      They indicate that the earth
 throughout          the greater part of its mass                  is   capable       of transmitting
 two       types of elastic          waves,         and    is    therefore        an    elastic     solid.
 The only way to escape from this conclusion                              is    to argue        that the
                                                          has been mathematically worked out

somewhat incredible                    conclusion           that the        speed    of        these waves
increases with             the (arcual) distance           (See B.A. Report,
                                                                  traversed.
1898, p. 220.)               This question of the nature of the large waves,
however, cannot be regarded                           as    finally settled.         What is           needed
is a more complete             discussion             of many typical records.
      In   an isotropic solid there are two types of waves                                — the       conden-
sational-rarefactional and the purely distortional.                                       In    the latter,
the speed of propagation is determined by the                                  rigidity or        resistance
to change            of form   ;   in the former, the compressibility comes into
play also          as a   determining factor.                    The condensational wave               travels
more quickly than the                   distortional.              Hence it is natural to               regard
the        preliminary       tremors         as    corresponding             to the condensational
type of wave.                Now, it is quite conceivable                      that an          increase      of
pressure may influence the resistance                                to compression            to a marked
degree, and yet have a comparatively slight effect on the resistance
to distortion.              That     is to say, the speed of propagation                               of the
condensational type                    of wave         may         be,    through    its       deterniinin;
elastic constant,            affected by change of pressure to                       a   distinctly      more
appreciable           extent than either the density or the rigidity.
      If   n is the rigidity and k the resistance                          to compression            (the reci
procal of the compressibility), the squares of the speeds of                                          the two
types of wave are respectively

when           p    is the density.           Now,          if    we suppose        k to have           at the
surface            the value   pi,     and    if      we assume           n to increase         with     depth
at the same rate as p (namely, -2S per cent, per mile descent)                                              and

about 2'2 per cent, per mile descent.
  I        am not aware        of any experimental attempts                          to measure             com
pressibility           of solids       at high         pressure          and temperatures such                as
exist in the interior                  of the earth.                All    we can        say    is   that    the
relation indicated above, namely, decrease of compressibility                                               with
increase of pressure               and       density,        is    quite consistent with               modern
views of the constitution of matter.

  From          a   study of the seismograms                   obtained in his Isle of Wight
observatory,          Milne   has been          led to           a    very curious result, which
seems to point to          a reflection       of trains of waves at some well-marked
                                                                                                   '                     '

character — the group of 'large                      waves' being followed at definite
intervals by          one or more        similar groups of much smaller wavelets.
The manner in which the 'grouping' is reproduced                                                  is,   to say the
least, very striking.             A    particularly             instructive            case   is        the     Shide
seismogram            of June     29,        1898,      hero         reproduced, with                    Professor
Milne's kind           permission.
   The first         figure shows, on reduced scale, the complete seismogram.
The motion recorded               lasted       for   3    hours.            First      wo have the Pre

20 minutes            the Large         AVaves          enter abruptly                  upon            the     scene.
These then dio away in gradually                               diminishing             tremors.               2s'o\v   a

 divided broadly into two groups, and that each group                                             is    not unlike
 the   group of serrations that constitute the large waves.                                                The sug
 gestion       is   that they are either direct consequences                                  of these large
 waves, or at any rate referable in their origin                                 to the same original
 disturbance.           To facilitate         comparison              the corresponding                       parts of
 each   group are        numbered alike —            1,        1',   1";    2,   2',   2";    etc.
   It    is,   however, in the two groups succeeding                                   the Large                Waves
  that the most striking             correspondence                  is   observed.           This         is   clearly
  brought       out in fig.       2,    which        contains enlarged                    representations
  of   the     tail groups of the complete                           seismogram.              Here            also,    to
  facilitate        comparison,        the     corresponding                  parts       are           numbered
  similarly, but, as       will   be readily seen, the                     numbering in these does

not quite correspond with the numbering in the complete seismo-
gram.      In considering         the    possible     significance of    this apparent
correspondence, we must remember                      that the succession      of crests
and troughs in the scismogram                   does not represent the         vibration
itself, but is due to      a  fluctuation in the intensity of the vibrations.
For example,          the   well-marked           double    crest   6-7 is no doubt
composed     of  a  great many individual              vibrations.    This fluctuating
intensity    has long been known to be                  characteristic of earthquake
motions, and has its origin in the complexity of the original disturh
ance.    We    see, then,     that    a definite fluctuating character lwlonging
to one part of a drawn-out disturbance is almost exactly reproduced

in another part.          Two explanations of this           may be given.      We may
either suppose these similar groups of disturbances to 1« brought
into existence      simultaneously at the earthquake origin but to travel
at different speeds or by different paths through the earth                      ;  or we
may suppose the later disturbance                   to be a reflection of the earlier
at sonic distant barrier.
    If this  'repeating' character of certain                 seismograms     indicate*
reverberation within the earth, then we must postulate a compara
 tive uniformity        of structure       throughout       the   greater part of      our
globe, and    a  fairly abrupt boundary or transition                surface.     A  train
of waves of either type impinging on such                   a surface  will, in  general,
give rise to trains of reflected              waves     of both types, and trains        of
refracted waves also of both types.                   The greater the differences in
the elastic constants and            densities of the two media separated               by

through into the second      medium, and the greater       the amount     of
energy thrown back into the first.
    In a seismological paper published     *  some ten years    ago,  I dis
cussed at length the reflection and refraction of waves at a surface of
rock and water.     Some of the main results arrived at in regard to the
reflection and refraction of elastic waves at the boundary of rock and
water are indicated in the following diagrams (fig. 3).       Each figure

shows approximately the manner in which the energy of a particular
type of wave at a particular angle of incidence is distributed among
its derivatives of both types.    The incident ray is represented by the
broadest line passing     downwards from left to right.        The upper
medium is rock, and the lower water.         Since condensational waves

  only can exist in        a  fluid, there     is never more        than one ray in        the
  lower medium.            In all    the figures,   C   represents    a condensational-
  rarefactional      wave,      and    D   a  distortional.      The first two        figures
  show how an incident                condensational wave          breaks up into         two
  reflected   waves and one refracted wave.                  The angles of incidence
  are 36° and 80° respectively.               In both    cases the greater part of         the
  energy    is reflected     in the distortional        form, and in the second          case
  the reflected     condensational wave is practically non-existent.                     The
  numbers attached to the different rays indicate roughly the                      amounts
  of energy associated with them.                The accurate values will          be found
  in the article already referred to.
     In  the four remaining figures the behaviour of an incident distor
  tional wave at various incidences is shown.                       The condensational
  wave     travels faster than the            distortional    wave,    and is    therefore
  in all cases reflected        at a greater     angle.     When the       angle    of inci
  dence    approaches        35° (see     fourth diagram), the reflected            conden
  sational wave is sent         ofl" at a  very high angle, and curries away with
 it most of the energy,               about   80   per cent.,    while the amount           of
 energy associated         with     the reflected distortional wave is excessively
 small.      At   a   slightly greater       angle   of incidence, namely, 35'           16',
 the reflected      condensational wave passes off parallel to the                   surface
 with     zero   energy,       and at higher         incidences has        no   existence.
 With     the vanishing          of the reflected      condensational wave           at this
 critical angle,      the refracted condensational wave also vanishes—                       a
 very remarkable result.               Consequently at this angle all the            energy
 is reflected back into the rock in the distortional                    form.      See the
 fifth diagram, in which the direction the refracted my would                       have if
 it existed is indicated by            a dotted line.      For higher     incidences     the
 refracted ray comes strongly into evidence,                   accounting for approxi
 mately half the energy,              but becoming less important at very               high
incidences, until at grazing incidence nothing is left but the                    reflected
 distortional wave.
     Bearing in mind these broad facts regarding the behaviour                             of
 waves at surfaces separating two elastic media,                     and especially      the
fact that, in general,          each type      of wave     arriving   at such    a surface
brings into existence           the other type as well, we have little difficulty
in understanding how an earthquake disturbance may                             be    drawn
out in time         as   the various vibrations,           started   directly    by it or

indirectly by its secondary          effects in neighbouring          regions,    travel
through     the earth towards        distant      regions.       No doubt      also   the
quasi-elastic     character of the larger vibrations             referred to in my
paper of 1888 will make          the speed       of propagation depend on the
frequency.        These considerations seem to me sufficient to account
for the continuousness and the extension in time of the records at
these distant localities.
     My original object in discussing          the    reflection and refraction of
 waves at the boundary of rock and water was to show that earth
 quake vibrations,      as then understood,            could hardly      be expected
 to retain     their original characteristics after reflection and refrac
 tion at several     boundaries.        The     excessively      complex character
 of the motion of a particle on the            earth's surface, when         a seismic
 disturbance is passing,      is  demonstrated by all good seismograms,
 but is most completely demonstrated by Sekiya's model, which was
 built up point by point by           a   laborious synthetic         process    from    a
 seismogram giving the vertical and two horizontal                     components of
  motion (see Journal of the College of Science, Imperial University
  of Japan, vol. i. p. 361, 1881; also Nature, vol. 37, p. 297).
  In this particular     instance,   the    complexity is largely conditioned
  by the character of the origin        ;   but even if we assume a compara
  tively simple original form, reflections and refractions in the hetero
  geneous crust of the earth must of necessity              add complexity.
      But in Milne's earthquake 'followers'              wo have    the other aspect
  presented; and, on the plausible assumption that wo are dealing
   with reverberations or echoes,       as   they might be called, we aro con
  strained to postulate     a comparative simplicity of structure through
   out the greater part of the course of the waves.                Where      tho solid
   nucleus   of the earth passes        into the somewhat plastic, and,                 as
   some   believe, fluid magma         on    which      the   firm crust rests,        tho
   conditions may be favourable for reflection of                a large   part of the
   energy   of tho    incident    wave.       It   is   probable     that   for     some
   particular combinations of origin and observing locality tho condi
   tions for reflection and    subsequent        concentration of reflected rays
   are more   favourable than for others, so that the repeating character
   of certain seismograms     mny be more marked than that of others.

 condensed,     does not seem          to suit     these   recent seismological           dis
 coveries    so well    as the      theory of the solid nucleus.                The     very
 high temperatures required by Ritter's                  theory would         necessitate
 a gradient of temperature in the outer crust which is difficult                            to
 bring into accord with Clarence King's recent calculations;                             and
 there    are   other     physical       difficulties    besides.     But,     from       the
 seismological side, there is the difficulty of accounting for the two
 or more types of vibrations — the preliminary tremors, and the big
 waves.       On the other hand, the assumption of                    a  solid nucleus
 necessitates    the existence       of two such types at least.
    It  is probable that at a certain depth below the                   earth's   surface
 materials are in       a  state     bordering on fusion.           Lower down           the
 increasing pressure       raises     the melting point of the material                 to a
 higher    value than       the    temperature        existing    there  ;   nearer      tbe
 surface,   the temperature       falls off so rapidly as to be, at any              place,
 well below the melting             point of the        material     there     under      its
 particular    pressure.      We     assume,      of course, in accordance            with
 Barus's experiments on diabase,               that the melting         point of      most
earth-forming materials is raised by increase of pressure.
    It is possible,   however, that in former ages this critical shell                     of
 material just bordering on fusion was really in a state of                       fusion.
The settling down process by which at                    a  particular     stage in its
history the surface of the earth became cool enough to be habitable
is well described by        Kelvin in his       last articlo on    "The Age        of the
Earth     as an Abode       fitted for      Life" (Phil. Mag., January             1899).
Twenty-four       million   years     ago, according to      Kelvin's and       Clarence
 King's calculations,      there was no solid crust           ; but when the         solid
crust began to form by           a  kind of crystallisation, it would rapidly
cool over its surface.          There would soon be an approximation                      to
present conditions, but the crust would                be subject to greater and
more frequent ruptures and readjustments.                   Changes of level of         the
solid superstructure would occur more rapidly than at present,                        and
underground        displacements         and     explosions     would      occur     more
frequently and with greater             violence.     As the earth       continued       to
cool to its present state, the conditions for the production of                    earth
quakes would       become      less favourable.         The causes that         operated
five million    years ago were         the same      as those    that operate       now ;
but they would operate more rapidly and with greater                        vehemence

then than now.           We   have     recognised     within    the    last decade       that
the earth's crust is everywhere in               a constant state of tremor, slight,
no doubt, hut measurable.                In former      ages these tremors existed
also, and probably in        a   much more pronounced form.                  The geologist
can to some extent build up the volcanic conditions of the past                              ;
but    the    earthquake seems to leave              behind     it in      the    geological
record no effect that can be chronologically                   interpreted.          Faults,
thrust     planes,    synclines and anticlines, all tell           a    story of seismic
action   ;   but with what rapidity these changes               and     distortions were
effected     we. know not.         Geologists tell us that there           is no evidence
of increased        volcanic      activity    in   the   past;    but      that does not
settle   the    question of seismic          activity.     Distribution        of   volcanic
Tocks, and faults and contortions               of strata nrar the turfwe, throw
practically      no  light on the seismic          phenomena of to-day, nor can
we expect them to throw much more on the seismic activity of the
past.      It is at all events      not improbable that in former times, and
perhaps      not so very long ago, the continual shakings, tremblings,
and tremors had an average intensity and a distribution                         far exceed
ing what they have now.               Under      the influence of these, materials
would yield more easily and more quickly to the stresses acting
on   them, just        as a steel     rod becomes fatigued and                 deteriorates
under intermittent loadings.               Js it not   conceivable      that under such
conditions contiguous strata might slip the                     one     over the       other
without any apparent unconformability                   ?    And    is   it   not  likewise
conceivable       that strata may have suffered extension, or the reverse,
 while they were being bent?                 In   the production        of these strains
or distortions        under     the    influence of       appropriate stresses,          the
mechanical        vibration     that accompanies          seismic    phenomena         mn>i
certainly have played an important role.

Magnetic Twist in Nickel Tubes.                                    By Professor                  C. G.

     (1
                      — In previous papers* have had occasion to   I
discuss at some length the relations between Joule's discovery of
the       elongations accompanying magnetization in iron and Wiede
mann's discovery of the twist produced in an iron wire under the
combined influence of longitudinal and circular magnetizing forces.
Following out                a suggestion          of Maxwell's    t     as      to the     ultimate
connection between                 these two phenomena,            I    turned my attention
to       nickel, in the          hope      of finding     the Wiedemann                 effect    in it
opposite        to what it is in iron in low magnetic fields.                              The fact
that,      as   Barrett      J   had shown, nickel          contracted in length when
longitudinally           magnetized,          whereas,    in low       fields,     iron elongated
was the ground for this hope, which experiment                                fully justified.
     In    a recent paper on the strains produced in iron, steel,                                nickel
and cobalt tubes           in the magnetic field (Trans. Roy. Soc.                               Edrx.,
vol. xxxix.,           1898),        I
                                have obtained, on sufficiently reasonable
assumptions,           values        for the strain coefficients            at the       inner     »nd
outer walls of these tubes.                       Hitherto, work by other experimenter?
on similar lines had been on ellipsoids, rods, or wires, solid through
out.        The       theoretical discussion of the Wiedemann    Effect (as I
have       called      it)   was rendered the more difficult on this account,
and also because the current producing                          the circular magnetization
flowed through the magnetized                         material.        In my paper of 18^
referred to above,               I   make an attempt to get             a     formula by means
of which the Wiedemann effect may be calculated from the Joule
effect.         The formula          is   applicable, however, only to              a   thin-walh-1

if   possible the Wiedemann effect in them also.                                        The comparatively
large radius of even the narrowest tubes which had been found
suitable for the other work precluded the hope of getting power
ful circular            magnetizations,            so   that, according to the view advocated,
the "Wiedemann                     effect    would            be very        small.       As will         be       seen
below, it was, in fact, little more than just measurable                                             in    a very
thin-walled nickel tube.
     The nickel             tube    used         in this investigation                was that known                 as

an axial current passed along a rubber-covered wire which threaded
the tube '20 times.           This     sheaf    of wires really passed through                 a

    In     the   preceding Table            of   results    H   is   the  longitudinally
magnetizing field produced by the current in the vertical                                mag
netizing coil, H' is the circularly magnetizing field acting on                            the
thin wall of the tube, and due to the axial current.                       The "twist'
is the angular displacement of the mirror                   divided by the length            of
the tube.         The      observed       deflections      were     very   small,       never
exceeding       2  of the millimetre           divisions of the scale, so that             the

angular displacement of the minor was never                             greater    than     1A
minutes of arc.          It   was impossible to read            certainly to less than
tenths of      a  divi.sion.      Consequently         each    number, although the
average of eight readings,            may    be out       by   2   or   3  in the second
significant figure.
     These results are shown graphically                  in the full line curves           of
fig. 1, p. 592.        In    these cases the axial current is kept constant,
and the helical current is varied.                   When       the helical current          is
kept constant, and the axial current varied, the twist is much
smaller, being indeed barely                 measurable.           Thus     with    a   longi
tudinal field of 61, the establishing of                a  circular field of 5'74 gave
a   twist of only      1 x  10~6.      This  agrees with my former results with
wires.
     (3.) Circular and Lonyitudinal Magnetizations in the Nickel
Tube. — In order to have as complete a knowledge as possible of
the various       magnetic       properties of the tube, the magnetic induc
 tions were carefully           determined by the ballistic method, and tho
 magnetizations deduced             in the usual way.            To    the measurements
 made      with      the    ballistic   galvanometer         corrections        had    to   be
 applied for the lines of induction in the air spaces not occupied
 by the     metal.         In   tho   case of     the   circular      magnetization this
 correction      was     comparatively        small   ;   but     in   the    case    of   the
 longitudinal magnetization it amounted to a considerable fraction
 of the whole measured induction — to fully one-half in field 246.
 To make sure that the ends of the magnetized                        nickel tube had an
 inappreciable effect on tho field inside the tube,                         this field     was
 measured      directly      by means       of  a  secondary coil inserted within
 the tube.       It   was from these measured              inductions in part of the
 air space     within     tho    tube   that the correction for the whole air
 space    was calculated;        but it was found that this correction, based
  on direct measurement,           agreed    to form significant figures           with the
  correction    calculated on the assumption that the thin-walled nickel
  tube   did not appreciably alter          the field in the included air space.
  The    magnetizations        I   and   1'  corresponding to            the    longitudinal
  field  H and    the circular field      H'   are given in Table          III. K and Ii'
  are   the corresponding residual magnetizations,                      and the columns
  headed    K I, R'/I'        give the ratios of tho             residual      to the     total
  magnetization.

    As   we should expect,          the circular   magnetization in a given field
is greater      than the longitudinal          magnetization in the same field,
simply because the demagnetizing factor is greater in the latter
case.

   Thus finally               the twist         is

   This       is       exactly the same formula                             I           obtained formerly            as    the
 result of         a     much more complicated piece of analysis (see Trans.
 Rrnj. Soc.            Eilin., vol. xxxii.            p.   388).
    Since      H'       is   generally much smaller than                                 II,   the last factor may,
 without serious error in most                            cases, be written                     HVII;      and     in this
 form we see at once why,                                with          (X   -    /<.)    for nickel increasing in
 numerical             value rapidly at first and then very slowly in higher
 fields, the           value of    t should          pass through                   a     maximum in moderate
 fields.
    In     the case of iron,               X   has itself          a   maximum value                  ;   but the form
 oi the expression                above shows              that the maximum twist will occur
 in lower fields             than the maximum elongation.
    The       maximum twist                     was       observed                by me both in              iron and
  nickel, and its existence                     in the latter                   case       in which        there      is   no
  maximum elongation                   is   explained by the formula just given.

  Again, iu nickel          A.   is negative     in all fields, whereas in iron                   it   is
positive in low and moderate               fields.         Consequently in iron, when
the    circular magnetization is right-handed with reference                                to the
longitudinal      magnetization, the twist is right-handed also                            in low
and moderate fields and left-handed in high fields.                          In the         case of
nickel the twist is left-handed throughout.

      Let    us now make a quantitative comparison between                            t   and the
observed       twist.      For this    purpose       it will   suffice   to take the most
complete       series from Table          II.,   namely, the second,             third,      sixth,
and seventh,            and tabulate       the     calculated     and observed twists
alongside of one another.                  The columns headed                t   contain the
calculated twists, and the calculations aro made for longitudinal
fields 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 150.                      The corresponding values of
                taken by interpolation             from Table        I.,   are   4,       11, 17-8,
24,    29,    36-3,     multiplied    by 10-°.            The twists in Table TV. are
expressed in millionth* of            a   radian (10~6).

    The curves showing the march of                t with   magnetic field for H'
equal to 2-4, 6-3, and 15-8 are shown in dotted outline in fig.                     1,
and may be compared             at a glance   with the corresponding full-line
curves of observed        twist.
    There is an evident broad similarity.                  The two outstanding
differences are      :—
    (1.) The values of the observed twist for a given combination of
fields are always greater than the values of the calculated twist,
the difference     being greatest       for the lowest circularly magnetizing
force and least for the greatest.
    (2.) The observed maximum twists occur in lower fields than
those indicated in the calculated values, and are distinctly more
pronounced.
    And     to these may be added        —
    (3.) The twist for a given combination of circular and longi
tudinal magnetizations is much less when the circularly magnetiz
ing force      is superposed       on the longitudinally        magnetizing    force
than when the order is reversed.
    In seeking for      an explanation of these quantitative discrepancies
we must bear in mind two facts of the first importance.
    I.   Because    of teolotropy pre-existent or produced by the magne
tizing     forces, the principal      direction of strain does       not probably
coincide with the direction of the magnetizing force.

594             Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh'.                 [skss.
    II.  The     effects  of hysteresis will         be   to  produce   a   magnetic
aeolotropy, the main character of which is not difficult                 to imagine
or describe.
    Thus    let H'     bo  the    circularly    magnetizing force acting on            a
molecule of the tube, and let the longitudinally                 magnetizing force
H   be applied first in one direction, then in the opposite                 direction
(+   H,  - H).      Were there no hysteresis,          the resultant twist      would
be as   if the principal elongations          were first in the direction of one
of the dotted diagonals,            and then in the direction of the other.
But   because of the persistence          of H', conjoined with the effects          of
hysteresis,     the direction of principal         elongation   as the longitudinal
                                         Fio.   2.
                             (a)                     (6)
field changes       cyclically    from    + H to     -H     and back again to      +  H
will oscillate      between     the double arrow-headed lines and              will be
less inclined      to  H' than      the dotted diagonals (see fig. 2, a).            In
other words, the result is as          if  a more     powerful H' acted without
hysteresis    ;  but this means in general         a greater twist, since H     > H'
usually, a result in full accord with (1).
   On the other hand, if we take the case in which the longitudinal
field    (H) is constant, while the circular field (H')                    is  varied
cyclically from + H' to           -  H' and back again to + H',           we see     at
once    that     the   direction      of   principal     elongation   will oscillate
between      the    double arrow-headed lines less inclined              to   H than
the dotted diagonals.            When H       is greater than     H', this gives a

1898-99.]   Prof. Kuott on Magnetic Twist in Nickel                Tubes.    595
 smaller twist — in other words, the result is        as  if a less powerful    H
 acted without hysteresis.
    Thus   we see the reason        why, when       H  is greater   than H' (as
is generally   the case), the twist for steady       H' and cyclically-varying
  ±H is    greater   than for steady       H and cyclically- varying ±H'.
On the other hand, for small values of H the contrary should hold.
This result could not       be established in the present experiment with
the nickel tube, because of the minuteness              of the effect in small
longitudinal    fields;    but it was obtained eight years ago in my
experiments with wires (see Tram. Hoy. Soc. Edin., vol. xxxvi.,
 1891). The curves published with that paper show the result
very beautifully; for in the            lower   fields the curve giving the
twists in ascending       longitudinal    fields, when the circular field is
varied cyclically,     lies   above   the curve giving the twists in the
same    combinations of field when the longitudinal              field is varied
cyclically.    At  a certain field the curves cross, and the first-named
curve continues ever after to be the lower.               The critical field in
which the twist is the same, however the combination                    of fields
may be applied, is greater            as  the circular    magnetizing field     is
increased — a conclusion         quite in accord        with the views now
stated.
    The fact that the value of the twist, calculated by means of the
 formula given above, is intermediate to the two observed values
obtained experimentally         (1) with cyclical variation of the longi
 tudinal field, (2)   with    cyclical variation of the circular field, is a
 result of some importance.            It demonstrates the sufficiency of
 the explanation     given by Maxwell that the Wiedemann effect is
 essentially the Joule effect.       In other words, in striving      to get an
insight into the molecular changes           that accompany magnetization,
we are not warranted in considering the twist effect observed                  by
 Wiedemann as involving         any factor that is not prominent in the
 production of the elongation effect observed by Joule.

                The Hydrolysis of Thallic Sulphate.
                          By Hugh Marshall, D.Sc.
                                 (Read  June  5, 18S9.)
    The   alteration      of   the   amount of        hydrolysis      by   change     of
temperature has been directly observed                in connection with various
salt solutions.         In the     case of ferric      salts,   quantitative     deter
minations      have      been     carried   out by      Wiedemann,         employing
magnetic methods.            He showed that, in the           case  of the sulphate,
the amount of hydrolysis             is considerably        increased     by   rise   of
temperature.         A similar      effect is observed       in the case of gallic
sulphate, and here the change is directly evident;                     a  solution    of
the salt when heated           deposits   white basic salt, which re-dissolves
on cooling.       A somewhat        analogous    case which has recently come
under my notice, and which, so far as                I  am aware, has not been
noted previously,         is provided by thallic         sulphate solution.        The
thallic   salts     generally    are   decomposed       more      or less easily     by
water,    with     formation     of a brown        precipitate, but       dissolve    in
dilute    acids,    giving colourless solutions (Crooke,              Lamy,    Wilhn,
Strecker).       An acid solution of thallic sulphate, provided it does
not contain too great an excess of sulphuric acid, may be used to
illustrate    several     points connected with the hydrolysis                of salts.
Dilution with          water produces       a  brown      precipitate.      A  similar
precipitate is formed in considerable quantity                   when the solution
is warmed;         when the mixture          cools,   the precipitate slowly re-
 dissolves,  and a clear colourless solution is again obtained.                   It   is
 therefore evident that the formation of the precipitate is not due
 simply to     a   colloidal    substance    being rendered insoluble, but to
 a greatly increased hydrolytic           action.    A further interesting point
 observed    with     some of solutions examined, though not                 with all,
 was the effect         of other     sulphates upon         the    action.     Certain
 solutions which         gave   deposits on heating,         and cleared     again on
 cooling, were       found to give        no precipitate after a considerable
 quantity    of solid ammonium sulphate had been dissolved in the
 solution,    indicating      that   at   higher    temperatures        there   is less
 hydrolysis      in   presence     of the other sulphate.            Other solutions
 gave a precipitate even         after the addition of ammonium sulphate.

though           probably        in     these   cases also      the amount of hydrolysis
would be diminished.
    The brown precipitate produced by the action of water on the
thallic salts          is stated        to be thallic     hydrate, not          a basic     salt.     In
that      case    the action might be supposed                       to be that expressed             by
the equation
                                         =
                        TI2(S04)3 + 6H30   2T1(0H)3 + 3H,S04.
    According            to Lamy, however, thallic                  hydrate is      a    metahydrate
(TIO.OH), though Strecker states that he could obtain only                                           the
anhydrous oxide. This might be explained by assuming that                                            the
orthohydrate             [Tl(OH)3] is first produced, but loses water sub
sequently.             There      however, another difficulty.
                                  is,                          Willm states
that       he         experienced          great      difficulty       in     preparing       normal
thallic sulphate, but                     readily     obtained       a     colourless basic         salt,
T1.,0(S04).,5H20,                by crystallisation from strongly acid solutions;
a   similar but less hydrated                       salt was        even     precipitated by the
addition of concentrated sulphuric acid to the solution.                                    Strecker
prepared and analysed the normal salt, to which he ascribes                                          the
formula T1.,(S04)37H20,                    but says nothing about             a   simple basic salt.
By addition of solution of                       potassium         hydrogen sulphate to his
thallic sulphate solution,                 on the other hand, he obtained                   a   white
crystalline            precipitate,       having      the composition expressed               by the
formula T120(S04),2K2S04.
    There         is    therefore some doubt              as    to whether          normal thallic
sulphate exists             in the ordinary             solution containing dilute acid.
As    it   would be of considerable interest to have the matter cleared
up,   I     have       commenced           an investigation          of the thallic         sulphates
and        their        double        salts,    and   I    also       propose       to    investigate
quantitatively             the action of water upon them.
     If    it    is    desired    simply to show the action of heat on thallic
sulphate solution, without requiring specially to prepare                                   the pure
salt,      this may be effected                    by warming            thallous       sulphate and
ammonium persulphate with                       a   little water.          If the ammonium           per
sulphate         is    approximately pure, equal weights of the two salts may
be taken.              A  considerable amount of brown precipitate separates                            ;
the mixture should then be allowed to cool, and filtered, or sulphuric
acid may be added till the precipitate                         is   just    dissolved.     The clear
solution, obtained in either way, gives                        a    precipitate on heating.

  or days through         a certain range came to rest much quicker            when
  left to itself than when set in vibration after it has been at            rest for
  several days and then immediately left to itself."             On the    strength
  of Lord Kelvin's statement           this elastic fatigue of metals has       been
  regarded     as   a   definitely   ascertained    fact.   But,  quite    recently
  (Physical Rtrietc,        March     1899),   Mr Joseph      O. Thompson        has
  published     a paper      "On    the   period and logarithmic        decrement
  of   a  continuously vibrating wire,'' in which he states that it           seems
  probable that
                      " for constant temperature and constant
                                                                        amplitude
  the logarithmic decrement is constant."               This conclusion is based
  upon his observation that the logarithmic decrement,                in the    ease
  of   a copper    wire, when the amplitude of vibration             varied    from
  about 185° to 175°, had the same value after it had been                continu
  ously vibrated through the average arc of 180° for fifty consecutive
  hours as it had at the commencement             of that period.   Observations
 upon other metals seemed to support the conclusion.
      Lord Kelvin also stated that fatigue caused an increase                of the
 period of vibration.          Mr Thompson finds that " no matter              what
 metal was used, no matter whether the arc of vibration was                       a?
 small    as 20°   or as high as 200°, no matter whether the wire                was
 long or short, thick or thin (provided of course the breaking strength
of the wire was at least twice the weight of the disc), the result              was
uniformly the same, namely, that when temperature                 and amplitude
of ribration remained constant, the period of vibration was a             constant
quantify."
     Mr Thompson, after having          reached the above conclusion regard
ing the logarithmic          decrement,    proceeds   to determine,  if  possible,

how Lord Kelvin could               have    obtained results      so different.     He
finds that the          value  of the decrement         at a given range depends
essentially upon the magnitude of the maximum                        oscillation   pre
viously given        to the wire ; and he suggests that the increased value
of the       decrement      may have been due to an accidental increase              of
maximum range.
    I   scarcely think that the suggested explanation is probable.                    I
think rather that Lord Kelvin's results and conclusions                       are un
assailable.        A considerable number of experiments               were made by
the students working            under Lord Kelvin's directions.              In order
that    the explanation should hold,           it would     be necessary    to assume
that, in each case, too large an initial oscillation was given to the
fatigued wire while the unfatigued wire was correctly oscillated.
There does not seem to be any sufficient reason for assuming                      such
a condition persistently.
    In     the series of experiments which           I   have  made upon the tor
sional oscillations of an iron wire (Trans. Boy. Soe. Edin., 1896
and 1898), the results show a distinct effect of fatigue upon the
 rate of       decrease     of oscillations   and entirely       corroborate      Lord
 Kelvin's      results.     No attempt    was made to investigate the effect of
fatigue upon the period of oscillation.
    If  y be the range of oscillation, while x is the number of oscilla
 tions made since the commencement              of the experiment, the equation
                                     y"(x + a) =    b,
 where a, n, and         b are constants    in any one experiment, holds with
 great accuracy         throughout a large range.          This gives   as  the valuo
 of the logarithmic decrement           the quantity

                                        y ax     nb
 In the       papers    referred to, I  have   shown that the value of         b may,
 by suitable treatment regarding fatigue, be diminished to one-half
 of its initial value while n is not much different from unity.                   Thus
 the logarithmic          decrement   may be doubled.          In   more   recent   ex
 periments,      not yet published,       I  have obtained      still greater    varia
 tions.
    I  found that it was possible to have the product nb sensibly con
 stant   ;  that, in general, log. nb is practically proportional             to n   in

 various suitably conducted series of experiments, the constant of
 proportionality      being different     in    different series;    and that,     in
 each such case,     it is possible to choose a y-unit which         will make    nh
 practically constant.
    Xo doubt    one cannot conclude, from the behaviour of one wire,
anything regarding the possible behaviour of another under similar
conditions.     Yet the presumably identical            cause of the decrease      of
 the range    of oscillation in each wire renders it probable that               the
same law applies       in all — at least when the decrement is not exces
sively large.
    I cannot therefore account for the results which               Mr Thompson
has obtained, unless        it bo that the treatment to which his wires
were subjected was such that
                           log. nb —  log.  A+n      log. y0
where   7/0
            is the angle     of oscillation at which readings were taken
on the average, and         1/A is   the logarithmic        decrement,   so that    a
linear relation, similar to those above spoken of, held between log.
nb and n.
    That this relation did not hold at values of y other than         »/ais evident
from Mr Thompson's observations.              Indeed, Mr Thompson expressly
points out that, when the wire was oscillated for some time through
a  considerably smaller range than         y0,  before observations were made
on the decrement       at y0, the decrement at y0        "as was to be expected,
was lower than any hitherto found."              This  statement   seems to be an
explicit recognition of fatigue.           If   a decrease   in the value of the
decrement at      yQ   were   essentially produced by previously keepinc
the wire oscillated for some time through a smaller range, much
more should there be a decrease           if it  were previously kept entirely
unoscillated.

    Introduction.   — All craniologists        are  familiar    with the form of
craniometer      or calliper-compasses         at present employed for the
purpose of ascertaining the various diameters of the cranial box,
and they know that these measurements represent certain facts in
connection with the breadth, height, and length of the skull as
applicable to a number of accepted fixed points upon the surface of
the cranium.        In   effect    these   diameters     are the direct      lengths
between     two points upon an arched surface,                 i.e.,  they are the
chords of certain arcs, and by the use of the measuring tape we
may     ascertain the relative proportions between                the arc and the
chord which subtends it.            "When     several  bones     contribute to the
formation of the arc we may readily determine the relative pro
portions between      each section       of the arc (or the chord of each
section) and the chord of the entire arc, but it is a much more
difficult matter to segment the chord of the entire arc in terms of
perpendiculars      prolonged to it from definite points upon the arc.
For    example,    by callipers we obtain the glabello-occipital length
or chord of the     great   longitudinal      arc, and by measuring tape we
may ascertain the frontal, parietal, and supra-inial sections                 of this
arc, but we do not thereby segment                   the chord of the arc by
perpendiculars      prolonged to it from the bregma and the lambda.
 Again,   such    important     transverse     diameters of the skull as the
 minimum       frontal,    stephanic,       greatest     parieto-squamous,       and
asterionic, are recorded without           reference    to their proportions on
opposite    sides   of   the mesial plane,          while the      almost constant
 visible asymmetry of the skull shows that the mesial                    plane does
 not    necessarily    bisect    these     diameters.        Further,     the   basi-
 bregmatic height might be segmented               in terms of     a point selected

the    craniologist.     Various     efforts   have     been made, to obtain         this
kind      of information.       Thus, an instrument            was devised     for    the
purpose      of measuring radii          drawn      from an inter-aural        axis     to
different points upon the surface of the skull, but the results                    have
not warranted its extended use.               Again, Sir William Turner.*              by
bisecting the skull and drawing radii from the bnsion to                     different
points upon the surface of the skull,             as  well as by raising    a perpen
dicular to the plane of the foramen magnum                   from the basion     to the
vertex, obtained much             valuable,    information,      but  the  extenrfon
of   this method entailed serious            damage       to each skull which        was
bisected.
    Professor Cleland t has also followed             a  plan which was    associated
with bisection of the skull, and had for its object the                   calculation
of the chords and angles connected                with each section of the         grt-at
longitudinal arch,       as  well as the distance of various points                upon
the arch from the base of the skull.
    As   the result of a conversation with I>r Waterston,             Demonstrator
of Anatomy         in the University         of Edinburgh,       my attention        was
directed to the possibility           of solving       the   problem    without       the
necessity     of elaborate     calculations, and      I  have accordingly      devised
a   modified     form    of    craniometer       which      overcomes    the    formc-r
difficulties,    and   by    means    of    which      cranial diameters may           be
segmented       by   perpendiculars      prolonged from fixed           points     upon
the    surface    of the    skull.     Moreover,        besides   being  easily      per
formed, this operation does not necessitate                    any damage      of     the

    Description of tlw InstrunuMt. — The instrument presents various
modifications of the craniometer in ordinary use (fig. 1). First, upon
one side of the graduated bar, zero is placed at the centre, and the
millimetre      scale is duplicated      from    the. centre   towards opposite
ends of the bar       ; second, opposite zero, a straight         calliper leg has
been    introduced.        This   leg   is   placed   at  right     angles    to  the
graduated bar, and being sunk in an undercut fiat groove, it may
be pushed backwards or forwards so as to alter its length relative
to that of the curved legs of the callipers without disturbing its
position at right angles to the graduated bar and without deflect
ing its pointed end from indicating             zero on that bar.         Further,  a
small    flat  spring sunk in the         bar at the bottom of the groove
assists in retaining this leg in any position to which it has been
adjusted.       Third, the two      curved    legs of the    callipers are so dis
posed   as to be    both capable of gliding upon the graduated liar, and
therefore since each of these legs may approach              or recede      from the
central     one, the edge of the armature which             carries    each    curved
leg indicates, upon the scale, the distance            which the point of each
 curved leg is from the point of the central straight leg, i.e., from
 zero.    Fourth,    the  central leg may be removed            (tig.  L'),  and  the
 groove closed by a metal slip.          Thereafter, since the reverse side of
 the bar is graduated continuously from one end, by fixing one of the
 curved legs by means of       a screw,    the instrument is converted into an
 ordinary craniometer (fig. 3) available for any of its usual purposes.1
    It will readily be apparent that this thw legged calliper* is
 mathematically       correct in its mode       of measurement,       because since
 the curved legs of the instrument are of equal length, and                   as botli
 of them are fixed at right angles to the graduated bar, the chord
 or diameter which they measure is an imaginary line parallel to
 that bar;      and further,    the   central straight leg in its imaginary
 prolongation      intersects the chord of the arc at right angles, and
 therefore segments the chord in the same proportions that it does
 the graduated bar.

been privileged        to test the capabilities of this instrument                upon       a
number of human skulls, all of which had already been                          described
by himself in his "Challenger" Report.                   These consisted       of  eleven
brachycephalic         skulls      of   Sandwich      Islanders,    and     of     twelve
dolichocephalic          skulls      of   aboriginal      Australians,      and       were
selected     because      of their extremely         typical differences.         I   have
also examined         a    few skulls of anthropoid           apes for purposes of
contrast and comparison.
    Metlwds. — In obtaining the principal diameters                   of the skull, I
have been careful to adhere to the methods adopted and approved
 by  Sir "William Turner for ascertaining                these measurements,           and
their segmentation has been carried out in terms of well-marked
and definite points upon the surface of the cranium.
                            A. Transversk        Diameters.
    1.  Minimum Frontal Diameter. — The point                      selected     for     thf
segmentation       of this chord was the frontal suture in such                      cases
where     it was  still visible, but when it had entirely            disappeared the
upper end of the inter-nasal suture                was    taken instead.         In    this
way we can represent the relative proportions of the frontal                       region
on the right and         left   sides of the mesial       plane,   approximately          at
 the level of the roof of the orbits.
    2.  Stephanie Diameter.— The segmentation                  of this chord     may be
effected either from the same points as the                  preceding or from          the
bregma,       which     is   the    more   convenient      point.      It   frequently
 happens,     however, that the anterior end of the sagittal suture,                    i.e.
the    bregma,     does      not    correspond    to   the   highest    point in        the
transverse     arch    of the vault.         In other words, there           is such        a
pronounced obliquity             in the direction of the sagittal suture,                be
tween its posterior and             anterior ends, that it becomes difficult              to
regard it — the sagittal suture — as an accurate                  expression of         the
mesial     plane,   since     it may not run in            a  true   antero-posterior
direction.      At   the same time, there is no reason               to suppose       that
the    falx cerebri does not correspond with the direction of                          the
sagittal suture, and therefore the position of this suture may fairly
be taken     as representative of intra-cranial developments.
   3.   Maximum          Parieto-squamous         Breadth.   — This      diameter          is
most    readily segmented            from   the  lambda,     and it is the        almost

constant discrepancy between the result obtained from the bregma
and that obtained from the lambda, which emphasises the
obliquity        of the sagittal suture.
     4.   Asterionic     Diameter. — This measurement            has   reference     to
the region of the cerebellum, and for the segmentation                        of the
chord a well-marked part of the external occipital crest                     near    to
the foramen         magnum     was selected.
     By    the segmentation      of these four transverse      diameters,   in terms
of different points representing the mesial plane, my object was to
indicate, if possible, the amount of divergence from true bilateral
 symmetry of           the  skull,    and  infercntially,   of the cerebrum       and
 cerebellum.

     Basi-bregmntie        Heiglit.  — The examination of       a skull   in vertical
 transverse section shows that the upper margin of the petrous bono
 (to which the tentorium cerebelli is attached), is practically upon
 the same horizontal plane as the posterior or supra-auditory root of
 the    zygoma.       Therefore by selecting the edge of this root imme
  diately superior to the external meatus              as a basis   for segmenting
  the    basi-bregmatic      height,     my    intention    was    to   express    the
  approximate proportions of this chord which pertain to cerebrum
  and cerebellum respectively.

      Glabello-ocripital     Length. — This diameter, which expresses              the
  length of the cerebrum            between    its anterior and     posterior poles
  plus    the   thickness of the skull at each end, may               be segmented
  in reference       to  several     surface  points.     Thus, by selecting the
  bregma,      we may ascertain         the prae-bregmatic     and   post bregmatic
  proportions of the total length.            Again, by segmenting the chord
  in terms of the lambda,        we may obtain not only the pne-lambdoidal
  and    postdambdoidal        proportions, but by taking the sum of the
   pra-bregmatic and post-lambdoidal segments and deducting it from
   the  total length, we may express, in the difference,             the sagittal or
   parietal   segment of the total length.           In this way     we may ascer
   tain approximately       how much of the total length is under cover of

the frontal, parietal, and occipital bones, and thus provide a series
of facts which are complementary to those ascertained by measur
ing the frontal,          parietal,    and supra-inial    sections of the          great
longitudinal        arch.
     At     the same    time,    the lambda is occasionally          so close to the
occipital end         of   the    glabello-occipital  diameter        that the     post-
lambdoidal segment            can only be stated      approximately.
     I  have    also segmented       the glabello-occipital     length in terms of
the anterior margins of the occipital condyles, and                  it will  be found
that the        anterior margin of the foramen magnum closely corre
sponds to a line drawn transversely between the anterior margins
of the two condyles.             This   measurement    is of much value in con
nection with the degree of erect attitude assumed                      by the various
races of men         as well as by anthropoid        apes and other mammals.
These segments          are defined by the       terms pra>-condyloid        and  post-
 condyloid.
     Lastly, by using the external auditory meatus,               I have represented
pra>-auditory        and post-auditory segments         for contrast with thoie
 derived from the position of the condyles.                 Approximately,        these
 segments are calculated from the centre of the external meatus by
 inserting the V-shaped end of the middle limb of the callipers.
     The details of the measurements            of the various skulls,        taken    in
 the manner above indicated, are given in the accompanying Tables.
                        Analysis of the Measurements.
     Minimum        Frontal Diameter. — (a) Brachycephalic skulls — Sand
 wich Islanders. — In three cases the right and left segments were
 alike    ;  in one  ease,  there was a preponderance         of  2 mm. in favour       of
  the left segment;        while in seven cases the excess lay to the              right
  side of the mesial        plane.     This  excess varied from          2—5 mm., the
  average being 3'2 in favour of the right side,               (li) Dolichocephalic
  skulls -Aboriginal         Australians. — In one       case   there was equality
  between       the right and left        segments.    In eight        cases the right
  segment predominated, the variation being from                   2-6    mm., with     an
  average of 3'2 mm.           In   three cases the left segment         was in  excess,
  giving an average of         2 '3 mm.

chimpanzee              produced equality in the two segments, while in the
skull of       a   young gorilla there was an excess of                      3 mm.       in favour of
the left side, and an excess of                 1   mm. in favour of the right side in
the skull of         a   small Gibbon.
     Stephanie Diameter. — (a) Brachycephali.                            — In    seven      cases     the
right segment was in excess, and in four cases the left segment was
the greater.             On the right side, the variation lay between 2-9 mm.,
the average difference being                4 8 mm.            On the left side, the figures
fluctuated from 1-11 mm., the average being                               4 '5 mm.
     (b) Dolichocephali.
                                  — In nine          cases the right segment                    was the
greater, its fluctuations being from                          1-16 mm.,          and      the   average
excess being 6 mm.                 In three         cases in which the left segment was
the greater, the average excess was                     4 mm.
     (r) Anthropoids.
                      — In the four skulls examined,                                 the right held
the advantage             in two cases, and the left in two                    cases.
     In   the frontal        region, therefore,         viewed       as a    whole, the evidence
seems to show that asymmetry is practically                                  a constant feature            ;
that it        does not exclusively select                   one side     in preference          to the
other     ;    and that its amount tends to a higher average                               increase    in
the Stephanie region              as compared          with the minimum frontal area.
While,         however,         the asymmetry is not                 confined to one side of
the skull in particular, yet there                     is,   in botli of the regions above
referred to,        a    decided preponderance in favour of the right segment.
This      is   shown by the fact that, of the forty-six                           measurements         of
human          skulls      taken in       these      regions,       no fewer than thirty-one
gave      the       excess      to the right         side.          Of   the    remaining        fifteen
measurements,              in    eleven    the excess           was on         the      left side,    and
only in four             cases were       the       segments        equal,      and each of these
four pertained            to the minimum frontal diameter.
     In           with this definite asymmetry in the frontal region,
          association
it   would be interesting to know whether these figures could be
made to bear any conclusions with                             reference        to the question of
right- and left-handedness.
     Maximum   Parieto-squamous Breadth. — (a) Brachycephali. — In
six skulls the excess was on the right side, and varied from 1-8
mm., the average                 being    4'1 mm.              In    the other five skulls            the
excess followed              the left segment,           and varied from 2-12 mm., tho
average being                   mm.

four    cases  the   right    segment      was in excess, giving         an average
variation of    2 '2  mm.; in seven         cases    the  left segment      predomi
nated,    with  an average excess of 3"5 mm.
    (c) Anthropoids.
                          — In two       cases    the  right side predominated,
and in two     cases  the left.
    In this region of the skull, asymmetry                was also a noteworthy
feature, and     in its proportions it was very much more pronounced
among the brachycephalic skulls.                 It  appears    to be quite    excep
tional to have the asymmetry            confined to the same side of the skull
throughout the series of transverse              diameters,    although in certain
skulls this condition may prevail.
    Asterionic Diameter. — (a) Brachycephali. — Bearing in mind the
 variable nature of the points which are the extreme                   ends of this
 diameter, it is surprising that four of the skulls indicated equality
between the right and left segments.                In other four,   the excess was
in the right segment, with a variation from 1-3 mm., and an average
excess of 2 mm.         In  the remaining three cases, the excess belonged
 to the left segment, and also varied from               1-3    mm.,  with   an aver
 age of 2 mm.
                            — In                        the right           left
     (b) Dolichocephali.              three    cases                  and          seg
ments were equal         ; in   five,   the   right segment        held an average
 excess of 1*6 mm.       ; and in four, the left held an average excess of
 4 mm.
     («) Anthropoids.
                          — In all four      the     excess   lay with the right
 segment.
     Of the twenty-three measurements                made in this region      on the
 two groups of human skulls, nine gave the excess to the right side,
 seven to the left side, and seven were              neutral.     This result, taken
 in conjunction with the small averages of the variations, and the
  variable character of the sutures            which determine the asterionic
 point, scarcely warrants any deduction concerning the value of
 the asymmetry       in this   region, although, as the asterionic diametor
  suggests approximately the width              of the cerebellum, it is perhaps
  not to be wondered at, that there should be                  so  much uniformity
  between the right and left halves               of the occipital region       of the
  skull.
      Rasi-bregmatic,    Height. — (a) Brachycephali. — In this group of

1898-99.]   Dr Hepburn on Improved Form of Craniometer.                        609
skulls    the height varied from          132     mm.    to 144 mm., giving an
average height of 140 mm.
    The    supra-zygomatic segment          varied from 109-120           mm., the
average being 113"9 mm.        ;   the infra-zygomatic segment varied from
21-30      mm.    Eepresenting       the   supra-zygomatic segment          in  the
terms of    a percentage   of the entire height, it varied from 78-5-84
per cent.,    the   average   percentage       for the group being 81-3          per
cent., leaving an average of 18"6 per cent, for the infra-zygomatic
segment.
    (b) Dolichocephali.
                           — In this      set the height varied         from 128-
 146 mm., giving an average of 135'5 mm.
    The    supra-zygomatic segment           varied     from 98-114       mm.,   the
average     being 106-1     mm.;      the   infra-zygomatic       segment    varied
 from 22-35 mm., the average being 29-4 mm.                       Again, reducing
 the supra-zygomatic      segment      to a percentago       of the total height,
 we find that it varied from 74 per cent, to 83-8 per cent., giving an
 average of 78"1 per cent., and leaving an average of 21 '8 per cent,
 for the infra-zygomatic     segment.
    (e)  Anthropoids. — The       figures showed a steady reduction of the
 supra-zygomatic segment,           with    a corresponding        increase  in  the
 infra-zygomatic     segment, so that upon the figures referred to, these
 apes formed a sequence from man in the order orang, gorilla, young
 chimpanzee,     adult chimpanzee.
     In view of   the fact that the segmentation            of the basi-bregmatic
 height into supra- and infra-zygomatic segments                 suggests approxi
 mately the relative proportions between the height of the cerebrum
  and the height of the cerebellum, the results above referred to are
  extremely    interesting,   whether       considered      as  averages    or per
  centages.
     In the human skulls whose measurements                 have    been given, the
  average supra-zygomatic height is           1 13*9   mm. or    8T3    per cent, of
  the total height for the brachycephali, and 106"I mm. or 78-l per
  cent,   of the total height for the dolichocephali.               Approximately,
  therefore, the cerebrum,       with the skull-cap, is 7-8 mm. or 3'2 per
  cent, higher in the brachycephali            as  compared with the dolicho
  cephali.     On    the  other hand, the           infra-zygomatic      segment   in
  brachycephali has      an average of 26 mm. or 18-6 per cent, as com
  pared with 29-4 mm. or 21'8 percent, in dolichocephali, apparently

indicating    that the depth of cerebellum, with thickness of skull
base near basion, is      3*2  per cent,   greater in dolichocephali   than
in brachycephali.
    In  the anthropoids, the steady diminution         of the supra-zygo-
matic segment,      and the correspondingly       steady increase    in the
infra-zygomatic segment, are equally noteworthy.
    Glabello-occipital Length. — The results obtained by segmenting
this diameter in   term.3  of the bregma and lambda are instructive,
although probably less distinctive of the two extreme varieties of
skull than might have been expected.
    (a) Brachycephali.
                          — The glabello-occipital    length averaged      in
the eleven skulls 175 "2 mm.
     (1) The prfe-bregmatic segment varied from 62-88 mm., giving
an average of 72 mm., or an average of 40'9 per cent, of the total
length.
    (2) The parietal segment varied from 90-105 mm., giving an
average of 97-9 mm., or an average of 55-3 per cent, of the total
length.
    (3) The post-lambdoidal segment varied from 3-9 mm., giving
an average of 6'2 mm., or an average of 3'5 per cent, of the total
length.
                          — The  average glabello-occipital length   of
    (b) Dolichocephali.                                                 the
twelve skulls was 187 '4 mm.
    (1) The prsB-bregmatic segment varied from 67-88 mm., giving
an average of 74-9 mm., or an average of 39-8 percent, of the total
length.
    (2) The parietal segment varied from 97-113 mm., giving an
average of 104 mm., or an average of 55'5 per cent, of the total
length.
    (3) The post-lambdoidal segment varied from 3-18 mm., giving
an average of 8 5 mm., or an average of 4 4 per cent, of the total
length.
    Several points of interest arise in connection with these figures.
Thus, taking into account the        thickness of an ordinary skull, it
must be evident that with        a post-lambdoidal      segment averaging
 6'2 mm. or 8"5 mm., very little,     if  any, of the cranial cavity can
lie behind the lambda.         The prffi-bregmatic segment, subject to
deduction for     the   thiekncsa of    the  skull in the region of      the

1898-99.]    Dr Hepburn on Improved Form of Craniometer.                          611
glabellum,      would      represent the      prae-bregmatic      segment     of   the
cranial cavity.*
    The difference of an average           of  1   per cent,    between the pne-
bregmatic segments           of these two outstanding groups             of skulls is
equalised by        a similar average     difference of      1  per cent,    between
their post-lambdoidal segments.             The interest, however, is largely
associated      with the parietal      segment,     which, notwithstanding         the
marked difference between the two groups of skulls in regard to
the average        length of the segment,         viz., 97"9 mm. and 104 mm.,
yet presents        an average     percentage    of the total length, which is
practically      identical    in the two groups of skulls, viz.,             55*3 per
cent, and 55-5 per cent.
    From      these   figures   it would   appear     probable that the greater
length of     a dolichocephalic skull,     as compared       with  a brachy cephalic
 skull, is due to different rates of growth at the coronal and lamb-
 doidal    sutures,     so  that while     the     parietal    bone    maintains its
 percentage proportion of the total length in each group, the gain
 of   1  per cent,     in the prae-bregmatic       segment      and the loss of        a
 similar    amount in the post-lambdoidal               segment      determines     the
 brachycephalic         skull,   and   the   reversal      of the gain and loss
 characterises      the dolichocephalic skull.         Stated in another way we
 might say that in brachycephalic skulls growth at the coronal suture
 is in excess of, or more active than, growth at the lambdoidal suture,
 while    in dolichocephalic skulls the opposite condition prevails.
 Further, the increased activity in the plane of the coronal suture is
 associated with a similar condition at the spheno parietal and squa-
 moso-parietal sutures to enable the bregma to attain that elevation
 above the zygoma          which characterises      the brachycephalic skull.
     Following up        the same line of inquiry         it  seemed     advisable    to
  segment     the diameter of greatest       length, in terms of the occipital
  condyles, for the purpose          of determining the relative position of
  the condyles to the glabello-occipital           diameter,    since  it is upon the
  condyles that the weight of the head is transmitted to the spinal
  column, and more or less balanced             in the erect attitude of man's
  progression.

    (a) BracliycepluUi      :—
              (1) The proj-condyloid segment varied from 87-100 mm..
                      giving an average of 92*5 mm., or an averap>
                      of 52-7 per cent, of the total length.
             (2) The post-condyloid segment varied from 70-97 nun.,
                      giving an average of 82 7 mm., or an average
                      of 47  i   per cent, of the total length.
    (1)) Dolichorephali     :—
             (1) The prre-condyloid segment varied from 92-10Smm.,
                      giving an average of 99 9 mm., or an average of
                      53'2 per cent, of the total length.
             (2) The post-condyloid segment varied from 81-94 mm.,
                      giving an average of 87 "5 mm., or an average of
                      4G-6 per cent, of the total length.
    Among these brachycephalic skulls, therefore, the pr«- condyloid
 segment    predominated over the post-condyloid segment by 9'S                 mm.,
 or 5"6 per cent, of the total length, whereas in the group of dolicho
 cephalic    skulls   the   praecondyloid       segment     exceeded     the     post-
 condyloid by 121 mm., or           G-G   per cent.     Thus we get an      average
difference of     1  per cent, upon the        total length.      In  the dolicho
cephalic skull this was placed in front of the condyles, while in                  the
 brachycephalic skulls it was placed behind the condyles.
    Now, although this is apparently a small amount of                  difference,
yet as an average percentage it has some importance, for it                    seems
to indicate that there is a more even and equitable adjustment                      oi
the   balanced      weight    of the brachycephalic           skull than     of   the
dolichocephalic      one, which     still  has a certain preponderance         of its
weight falling in front of its occipital condyles,              as is the    case in
the lower mammals.
   In this connection      the measurements          even  of  a  few  anthropoid
skulls are extremely interesting.           Thus, while in the brachycephalic
group    of human skulls        the prae-condyloid segment           exceeded     the
post-condyloid segment by          5 6 per   cent., and in the dolichocephalic
series the difference was G-G per cent.,          in the skull of    an orangutan
the difference was       31 -1  per cent.,     in   a  young chimpanzee          33'9
per cent., in a young gorilla         10   per cent., and in an adult          chim

panzee        46-7 per cent.        Xo doubt in all of        these   apes the develop
ment        of    the  frontal    sinuses,   superciliary        ridges,    and      occipital
crests may account for a considerable amount of the difference
between the two segments. Nevertheless it is quite evident that a
very       pronounced alteration occurs            in the relative proportions of
the      pr.T-     and  post-condyloid       segments       of the glabello-occipital
 lengtli     as we ascend      from the anthropoid             ape to man.          In other
 words, there is an adjustment of the balance of the skull upon                            the
 atlas in association with the assumption of the erect attitude.
       Prof. Cleland*      has directed attention to the balance                of the skull
  upon the vertebral column, and believes that its position in man
  results from the increasing prominence of the1 anterior extremities
  of the occipital condyles, whereby the skull is tilted upwards and
  backwards, the tilting of the skull being complicated by the in
   crease in cranial curvature which             proceeds from growth,                lie also
   points out that the falling forward of the skull in old age is due to
   the reduction in the size of the front ends of the. occipital condyles.
        Without attempting to criticise or traverse                  this argument,       and
   while admitting the value and accuracy of                        the    observations,      I
   nevertheless think that the measurements                    which     I  have    recorded
   show     proportions     between      the prte-condyloid          and post-condyloid
    segments      of the glabello-occipital       length which could not result
    merely from increased prominence of the occipital condyles, nor                         be
    affected     by their   partial     absorption.        It   appears     probable that
    varying rates of growth for the different sections                    or bones      which
    contribute to the formation            of the antero posterior arch of the
    skull result in an increase          of the occipital section, and therefore
    the condyles are proportionately           moved forwards in relation to the
    base  of the skull and the glabello-occipital diameter.
        An examination of         a  number of .skulls          will   show     that a line
     drawn     transversely     between      the   centres       of   the    two     external
     auditory meatuses occupies         a  variable position with regard to the
     plane of the anterior margins of the occipital condyles.                          This  is
     true not only      of human skulls, but also of the skulls of other
     mammals.        In order    to obtain facts      for comparison          I   segmented
     the glabello-occipital     length in terms of the centre of the external
     auditory    meatus.

    (a) Brachyaephali.
                            — Only      one  skull   gave   similar    prw-auditory
 and prse-condyloid segments.             In  three, the centre of the meatus
 was anterior to the plane of the condyles              ; and in the remaining
 seven,   the centre of the meatus             was behind the plane of th<
 anterior borders of the condyles by distances which varied fron.
 2-12 mm., the average for the seven being 4-2 mm.
    (b) Dolickocephali. — In one skull the praB-auditory and prse-
condyloid segments were alike. In two skulls the centre of th*
meatus was      2  mm. in front       of the plane of the condyles          ;  in   the
remaining nine the centre of the meatus was behind the plane of
the condylar anterior margin by distances which varied from 1-6
mm., the average being 3'7 mm.
   (c) Anthropoids.
                          — In  the four anthropoids        that were measured
the centre of the meatus was in each case definitely in                 front of   the
plane of the condyles by distances             which   varied from 8—15 mm.,
the average for the four being 10 mm.
   These     measurements         indicate,    that   relatively     the    external
auditory     meatus     is farthest forward        upon    the glabello-occipital
length in anthropoids, and that it is farthest back upon the same
diameter in brachycephalic skulls.              Further, it would appear that
during    the    acquisition    of the erect       attitude,    as    the occipital
condyles have        apparently       moved     forwards     in  relation     to   the
glabello-occipital     length,     so   the   external    auditory     meatus has
moved backwards until in the majority of skulls the centre of the
meatus     really   falls   behind     the plane of the condylar            anterior
borders.
   Of  course this is a small number of measurements                  on   which to
base any broad generalisation, and such an attempt is not intended.
The object has been to illustrate the kind of information which is
within   reach    by means of a particular instrument, an extended
application     of which     may evolve        additional   new facts.        At the
same time     I cannot refrain from mentioning, in conclusion, that it
seems more than a coincidence to observe, that, in every particular
where an average total ot an average percentage has been possible,
the dolichocephalic skulls have been placed               nearer   to the anthro
poids than in the case of the brachycephalic skulls.

Preliminary Note                of   Experiments showing Heat of
          Combination in the formation of Alloys of Zinc
          and Copper to be Negative when the Proportion
          of Copper is less than about 30 per cent.                              By
          Alexander Gait, D.Sc.
                                 (Kca.l May  1,  1899.)
      Iii   March of last year     I communicated        to the  Society    a  paper
 giving a detailed account of           the procedure adopted       in an experi
 mental investigation, which           I  had undertaken       at the    request   of
 Lord Kelvin,         on the heat of combination        of pairs of solid metals
 in the formation of alloys, along with             a statement   of some results
 which       had then been obtained.
       The.   pairs of metals chosen were copper-zinc and copper-silver,
  and. briefly restated, the experiments were conducted              as  follows: —
  About half        a gramme    of alloy, reduced to powder by means of             a
  file, was dissolved in dilute nitric acid, and an equal weight of                 a
  mixture       of the    same   two   metals    in the same proportions         was
  also     dissolved under exactly similar         conditions      The difference
  between the initial and final temperature               in each   case   is an in
  dication of the heat of solution.             If the two results are the same
  then there is no heat of combination in the formation                 of the par
  ticular alloy tested.        But if the heat of solution of the mixture
  exceeds that of the alloy, then there must bo heat of combination
   in the formation of the alloy equal to that difference.              The experi
   mental results, then, afford      a means     of approximately determining
   in absolute measure the heat of combination of the metals in the
   formation of an alloy.
       The investigation has been continued           since, my last communica
    tion,   and   I  expect to have it finished and to communicate                the
    results to the Society either towards the close of the present            session
    or at the beginning of the next.          Altogether     twenty-one different
    copper-zinc     alloys, varying in composition from         5 to  90 per cent,
    of copper, and also live copper-silver alloys, containing from 10 to
     65 per cent,    of copper, are under observation.

620             Proceedings        of Royal Society of Edinburgh        .         [--r.
    I   may here note,          however, that the copper-silver alloys           sho*
little or no heat of combination, that many of the copper-zinc                   alby;
Jo indicate         heat   of combination, the highest value,           52 ground
water heat units centigrade               per gramme      of alloy, being    obtains!
from those          alloys whose       composition is at or near the ordiury
chemical combining proportions of the metals considered                   as bi-valeit
elements,       that is 49-l per cent, copper and 50'9 per cent ant
With lower          percentages     of copper the heat of combination          rapidly
falls until, at about 30 per cent, copper, the alloy shows no                   heat of
combination.
    But   a   still  more surprising result — and this is the chief cause               o:
my present         communication — was obtained when alloys                containing,
respectively, 20'5, 16'0, and 10'5 per cent,               of copper were       tested.
Each of these gave            a greater  heat of solution than the        correspond
ing mixture, proving that in all of them                 the heat    of combination
had a negative            value.     The amount of this negative value               was
fourteen gramme-water heat units centigrade per gramme for                            the
alloy containing 20-5 per cent, copper                and also for the alloy        con
taining      16 0 per      cent, of copper,    while it was eight gramme-water
heat units centigrade for the alloy                containing    10-f> per cent,       of
copper.        This result      was then verified in another way.
    Half   a gramme         of an alloy numbered " 5," and containing               26'3
per cent, copper, and which had already shown no heat of combina
tion positive or negative, was dissolved in the usual manner,                  and the
result obtained compared              with that given under similar        conditions,
by    a  mixture of        "23   gramme     of free zinc with '27 gramme of            an
alloy, numbered          "C,"   and which contained the metals in the chemical
combining proportions (-t'J'l per cent, copper and 50"9 per cent, due)
previously referred to. As '27 gramme of alloy No. C contained
•1325 gramme            of copper, the quantitative composition of the               two
powders tested was the same.                 A  mean    of five tests gave    8"64° C.
as   the rise of temperature in the experiment with alloy No.                    5, and
8"42° C. with the mixture.                 In  one powder the quantity (1325
gramme) of copper present was alloyed                 with its chemical     equivalent
of zinc    ;   and in the other the same quantity of copper was                      also
present, but        it was alloyed with an excess of zinc above            the chemi
cal equivalent.           We might       have    anticipated that the large         heat
of combination previously noticed for alloy No. C would also                       have

1898—99.]     Dr Gait on Heat of Combination in Alloys.               621
been found for alloy No. 5, but the larger heat of solution for the
latter indicates that the excess in it of combined zinc (-23 gramme),
over   the quantity    (-1375   gramme)     chemically  equivalent to the
copper ('1325 gramme) present, apparently exerted a cooling effect.
The difference between the two heats of solution is 0*22° C, or 0"44°
 C. per   gramme   of metal dissolved.    The quantity of nitric acid used
 •was  70 cubic   centimetres of density      1 "360 at 15° C. ; the water
 equivalent    of the apparatus   was   3 5  grammes.    The result works
 out at 28'07 gramme-water heat units centigrade per gramme             of
 metal  ;  but one gramme     of the mixture contained     -54 gramme   of
 alloy No.   C, so that for one gramme of this alloy the value would
 be 28'07 x        = 52, which is near the value otherwise obtained     as
 the heat of combination per gramme of this alloy.          Thus again it
 is  shown that for alloy      No.  5  the   heat   of combination of the
 copper with its equivalent of zinc        is exactly neutralised by the
 cooling effect produced    by the excess of zinc present.

On Duplicitas Anterior in an Early Chick Embryo.
    By Thomas H. Bryce, M.A., M.B. (With Four Plate?.)
                              (Read  June   19, 1899.)
    The literature of Duplicity in Birds affords,              out of  3 total of
about ninety-five recorded cases of multiple formations of all kind?
on a single blastoderm, from the stage of the primitive                 streak      to
the fourth      day of incubation, only       a  small proportion of instances
of   "duplicitas anterior."        Dareste (i.) in his atlas figures three;
Gerlach (ii.) adds representations of three others — one case of his
own, a second originally described by Ahlfeld, and a third by
Reichertj Klaussner (iii.)        gives a seventh case; and Bianchi (iv.)
describes    a  monstrous embryo at a later stage (T5 cm. in length).
    Most observers have been content with the partial information
derived     from    the  study    of the     whole     object,  and only      three
embryos      of this class, which have been studied in serial            sections,
have been described       :—
              1st. Erich Hoffman's (v.) with         three somites.
            2nd.   Mitrophanow's      (vi.) with six somites.
             3rd. Kaestner's (vii.) with seven somites.
    The present case makes the fourth.             It  lies in point of  develop
 ment intermediate between Hoffman's embryo and Kaestner's,                      and
in    general   features   it closely    resembles      them,   but differs    from
 Mitrophanow's       in the greater       symmetry of the components,             for
 in his   ease, one   member was considerably further developed                 than
 the other.
     Thus, anterior duplicity is comparatively rare in birds,            althou<:!i
 it is the universal form in fishes, and the general             form in   reptiles
 and   amphibians.        Among the domestic             mammals it is not        un
 common,       but the only     case   of the condition       at an early     stag"',
 which has been studied by the help of serial sections, is               an early
 human derodyme         of 18 mm. described recently by Laguesse                  and
 Bue (viii.).
     The embryo which is the           subject of this communication              was
 obtained from an egg which had been incubated for thirty-four

1893-99.]        Mr    T.  H. Bryce on Duplicitas Anterior.                            623
 hours    Tinder normal conditions, and was the only abnormal embryo
found in two      dozen eggs which were in the incubator at the same
time.       The area pellucida was circular                and   regular    ; the    sinus
terminali*     and the vessels of the vascular area were just beginning
to    appear.     The blastoderm           was    removed       and    fixed in     picro-
sulphuric fluid,       the    specimen      was    lightly stained         with    borax-
carmine, dehydrated, cleared             in cedar      oil, and then drawn with
the    camera lucida.
    Figure A represents         the embryo viewed from above and magnified
 18 diam. Its length,         measured     from the head end to the extremity
of the primitive     streak, is 3'7 mm.         The anterior end consists of two
independent members,             which diverge from one another at an angle
of   80°.    The right member           in the figure       is slightly    smaller and
leas regular than the left         : each has a complete         somatopleure       and a
complete splanchnopleure, but the somatopleure                       becomes      single,
0'3   mm., the splanchnopleure, 0"4 mm., behind the head                       end, and
the neural tubes remain independent for                   a distance      of 0-76     mm.
 From this point      to the first somite the         neural canal is single,         with
 the medullary folds approaching one another,                  but not meeting.         In
 the region where the mesoblast is segmenting,                  the medullary        folds
 are very wide apart,           and   between     them     is seen a series      of five
 large and     regular cubes,        forming     an azygos       series   of primitive
 segments.      The lateral series have six segments,              which are smaller
 and irregular.     Posteriorly, where the mesohlast has not segmented,
 but still within    the   compass of the widely apart neural folds,                  two
 grooves appear, which run back for some distance parallel to one
 another, then bend          towards the       middle line, but do not meet.
 The right    groove seems to fade          away, while the left is continued
directly into    a tjTf n'cal mesial    primitive streak.
    Comparison with          a   normal embryo of the same period of in
 cubation    shows    that there       has   been     considerable retardation in
 development.
    The specimen       was embedded          in paraffin, and       a complete      series
 of sections    obtained       1-200    mm.    thick.       The    remaining      figures
 represent certain typical members of the series.
    Notochord.- — There are two separate                notochords throughout the
 whole length of the embryo, so                fir   as  it is differentiated.          At
  their posterior ends they become enlarged and pass directly into

624              Proceedings        of Boyal Society of Edinburgh,                        [ses.
the mass of cells underlying                   the primitive      grooves.       The      noto-
chords gradually come nearer together from before backwards,                                 but
never come into contact.
    In the four          cases     cited above       the   notochords were separate
throughout except in Kaestner's, where they were united at their
posterior ends.
    Mesoblast.     — In      the region of the         primitive      groove   proper (fig.
 14) the mesoblast           extends outwards from the axial mass of cells                     as
two lateral sheets in              a   typical manner.          Traced      forwards,        the
groove      gradually        dies   out,   and we have        a   flat ectodennic plate
(fig. 13), continuous with which is                a  broad axial mass of indifferent
cells, somewhat loosely arranged,                from which the lateral plates of
mesoblast        extend.         A few      sections    further      forward     two slight
grooves      indent the ectodermic plate, and when traced                         forwards,
it  is found        that one of these           deepens,    and from its apex there
extends      a   keel-like       mass of cells      continuous with         the mesoblast
on    each     side,   while the other is only             a  slight dip in the ecto
dermic        plate (fig.        12).     Further      forward,       however,      this   dip
deepens       into a well-marked             groove,    beneath which          is a similar
keel-like mass of cells,            so  that now there are two lateral             sheets     of
mesoblast,       and an axial mass between the two keel-like thicken
ings    (fig.    11).      These gradually          become     marked        off from      the
mesoblast       (fig. 10), and then from the epiblast (fig. 9) forming the
enlarged posterior              ends    of the     notochords,       while    the    grooves
become       the    two neural        furrows     to be presently described.               Be
tween     the two notochords lie the azygos                  primitive      segments.        In
some sections          (fig.    7) they are simple and have               a single     cavity,
while in others (fig. 8) they are double, and have two cavities.
    Xeural Canal. — Fig. 1 is the 58th of the series ; from this to                         the
 S34th   (fig.   3) the      medullary       canals    of the components are             quite
independent, and the medullary                      folds meet        one   another      along
 their whole length, but do not fuse.                     At    the    level of the       84th
section the mesial            folds become       enlarged,   and two processes           grow
from them towards the middle line, until in the 94th (tig. 3) they
meet and fuse.             These processes project above the level of the
somatopleure,         so that a space is left between               that membrane          and
the    fused      mesial       folds.    The    point    where      the   separate      neural
plates collide lies in front of the heart anlage at the                       anterior     end

of the ventral         coelom, at a point where that cavity          still  consists   of
two separate portions as in a             normal embryo — in       fact, at the point
where the head fold proper ceases, and where the lateral folds
begin to unite. From the 94th section to the 121st, the neural
plate is single, but there are two canals bounded by three folds, a
mesial and two lateral (fig. 4). The mesial fold consists of two
parts, which, as the neural plate becomes more and more limited,
and the neural canals approach one another, come nearer together
 and finally       fuse to form a solid septum,         which in turn disappears,
 and      a single largo canal is formed with gaping                 medullary folds
 (fig. 5).       Further back the medullary folds approach more closely
 again,     but nowhere unite (fig.         6).   Section 263 (fig. 7) shows that
 the floor of the now widely              open neural canal is indented by two
 shallow       grooves   above the two notochords, which are separated                by
  a    mesial     thickening      of the     common     neural    plate,   and    when
  followed backwards           are seen to be continued into the two grooves
  described      above.
       The Fore-gvt     consists, at the anterior end, of two entirely separate
  tubes, but, in the 75th section, their mesial walls come in contact,
   and a    few   sections further     back there is only one very broad and
   compressed cavity.           The lateral parts of the ventral            ccelom   are
   here    very far apart       (fig. 2),   and   in  a mass    of mesoblastic      cells
   between them are seen two spaces which unite in section 90 (fig. 3)
   to form a single cavity, again to separate further back, where the
   splanchnopleuric        folds begin to part.          1n   a normal embryo, the
   two anterior rnl-de-sars of the ventral cci'lom do not unite until                   a
   later stage opposite, or rather under the heart anlage.                     The two
   halves of the primitive heart           tube,  are  still wide apart    (fig. 4), for
    the splanchnopleuric folds have parted in front of the heart anlage.
    It  is also to be noted that the primitive               heart tubes are abnor
    mally broad and flattened out.
       In   the   three   cases of double chick          embryo belonging to this

     end,   while in the      former the canal was single along its whole

the anterior divergence of the axis was sufficient to                    allow of     t«-o
separate    neural plates     and two neural canals heing formed,                     and
for the same reason two fore-guts,                with     complete     somatopleuri?
and  splanchnopleuric        folds, while in the other cases these                 struc
tures were single.
   As   regards the condition of the primitive                streak, the four      case?
present    certain differences      ;   in Kaestner's         the compound        chorda
passed into a simple streak, which forked                  at its posterior end       ; in
Hoffman's the streak was forked at its anterior end, and the                          two
limhs were continuous with the mesial                  stem     behind, hut again        at
its posterior extremity         there were        traces     of what seemed to          be
accessory streaks.       In Mitrophanow's             case the two streaks         fused
behind, but the primitive           groove      of the smaller component             to
continued further        back than that of the larger, from which                      h?
concludes: " Dass      das Zwillingspaar        . . .  aus zwei ganz selbstandigen
Keimen entstanden ist, welche in Form von Primitivistreifen                         noch
selbstandig waren, wobei der Primitivistreifen                    des kleineren etwas
hinter    dem    des  grosseren      lag,   und letzterer seinerseita          zu dem
ersteren   in  einem   Winkel     gelegen war."           In my own      example, the
same from a surface view is apparently the case, only the union of
the streaks is further forward, and there is a single mesial primitive
groove behind.        A careful study of          the sections has convinced me
that such an interpretation cannot apply, but that there                      has   been
from the first    a  Y-shaped      primitive      streak.        The limbs of the Y
unite to form the broad flat plate described                   (fig. 13), from which
the  stem passes backwards,            narrowing        as  it   goes, till it has the
typical    form    of  a   normal streak (fig.           14).      On this Y-shaped
streak,    however, the primitive            furrow      has     not developed      as a
continuous groove,        but independently            on the stem       and limb?      of
the  Y.      On the left limb the furrow                has    differentiated further
back than on the right,        till it    has almost met the mesial             furrow.
There was no trace of accessory rudimentary primitive streaks                           as
in Kaestner's and Hoffman's              cases.
   In   considering the nature of          a  double embryo, such as the             one
 above described, one must distinguish between the question of the
ultimate origin of the duplicity and that of the determination                          of
its anatomical characters.            It  is in regard to the latter question

1898— 99.]         Mr   T.  H. Bryce on Duplicitas Anterior.                         627
that      the study of a series of sections of an early stage of the con
dition      can provide a definite answer.
      There has been much discussion over the meaning and fate
of the primitive streak. Many authorities, notably Balfour, have
allowed it       no part in the formation          of the embryo, others have
regarded it as gradually converted from before backwards into the
primitive axis, but considerable divergence of opinion has prevailed
 as to the exact share it takes in its formation. Recently, how
 ever, Kopsch (x.), by direct experiment, has demonstrated that
 the     whole streak in birds is used up in the formation of the em-
 hryn, only the anterior part of tin' head being laid down in front
 of it. Thus variations of the primitive streak acquire increased
 significance.       Multiple primitive streaks on a single blastoderm
 have been described by Allen Thomson (xi.), Bruckhardt (xii.),
  and Mitrophanow (xiii.) — but no case has yet been described, so
  far as I     know, of an undoubted simple single                 streak bifurcated
  in front.      This  is the   condition,   I   believe,     in the     present    ease,
  the only alternative explanation being that               there    are three,   radial
   streaks,   which   I   can   hardly accept      as   possible     in view of the
   appearances presented         by the    series    of    sections      through     this
   region.
       If  one  attempted to interpret         the   condition      in    the  light   of
   Hertwig's "Urmund" theory (xiv.) or Kopsch's (x.) modification
   thereof, and regarded       the primitive streak       as   homologous with the
   drawn-out gastrula mouth, the lips of which come together to form
   the axis of the embryo, such          a  Y-shaped        streak    would form an
    interesting parallel to the Y-shaped figures which              ( >. Pchultze (xv.)
    describes as resulting from abnormal gastrulation in frog's eggs
    treated by compression and rotation, and which resulted                      in tad
    poles showing duplicitas anterior.
        But, theory apart, the primitive streak         being the anlage          of the
    embryonal axis, the final constitution         of the double form will             be
    determined, in its variety        and   degree,      by the relations of the
    streaks (or the limbs of the streak) to one another, and by the
    measure in which the growth of parts is interfered with, owing to
     the approximation     of the cell masses constituting           their anlagen,     as

first laying down, at least in cases sueh                 as  the   present, where       the
germinal disc is regular and single.                   The series of sections        shows
clearly how the whole constitution depends on the relation of                            the
axes     to one another,        and the form and disposition of the                  future
organs can be definitely forecast.
    I  do not purpose        to enter in detail on the question              of the ulti
mate origin of the            duplicity.        Professor      Cleland    (xvi.), in     his
notable contributions            to the subject, regarded          (18S9) the cause        as
lying in     a  fission of the germinal mass occurring as the result                       of
the application         of some excitant, probably from without, the ulti
mate result depending on the date at which the fission takes place.
It   seems to be now prac tically universally                  admitted that      a fission
in some sense of the formative material does take place; but                        recent
research     all tends to prove that by the time the germinal                        layers
are    laid down, the cells have acquired their specific characters,
and are incapable of dividing               to form two individuals          of the   same
potentiality.*         This   is supported by the striking            fact that in    birds
duplicity      has    not    yet been       produced artificially.         Gerlach (ii.)
sought by varnishing eggs, except over a Y-shaped area above                            the
blastoderm,       to produce        a fission    of the germinal         mass,    but his
results are universally            regarded      as  proving nothing.          Moreover,
considerable       light has, within recent years,               been   thrown     on the
possible    nature of this fission by the experiments of the Entwicke-
lungs-mechanik           school,     associated     with      the    names     of   Roux,
Driesch,      Morgan,        Wilson,      Loeb,     Herlitzka,      0.   Schultze,      and
others     mentioned        in the     literature     list appended.          By   various
methods double and monstrous forms have been                            artificially    pro
duced from a single egg.
    All   these   experiments show that while in normal circumstances
each blastomere          has its fixed share        in   the developmental process,
under conditions           of separation,        of altered       mutual    relationship,
or of disturbed         equilibrium,       they may revert to the condition               of
the    entire ovum, segment             as   it  does,    and   produce double, or if
separation is incomplete, monstrous, forms.
   *
      Assheton (xxix.) thinks it conceivable that irregular splitting may some
times ariso in the morula stage, and during the formation of the blastodermic
vesicle, in such a way that the embryonic mass becomes divided into two
portions.

   It   is therefore in the early stagos       of development      that   the
origin of duplicity is to be sought.         It is one of the problems
which modern biological thought has hunted back to the ovum
itself, and there the secret must lie hidden, until we are in a
position to explain the conditions determining the orderly rhythm
 of normal development, from which it is        a departure.

tions to Section           A of the British Association*                  at  its meeting in
Bristol last September,               I described     as a   solitary wave of transverse
vibration        of the simplest possible              kind in an elastic             solid,     and
again, for periodic motion, as a very simple and symmetrical                                    cfe
of   a   train of periodic waves               of transverse        vibration.       The       work
done      by the circuital          force   on the ring is spent on waves of this
class travelling          outwards through ether, and in a very short                          time
the ring comes             practically      to rest.      It  does not come          to    perfect
rest suddenly by the departure from                      it of   waves    carrying      away all
its energy       ;  it  subsides to absolute rest in an infinite timo according
to the law t_i"sin qt.                 The resinously-electrified          fluid within         the
ring continues revolving                  with unaltered          energy     as long       as tie
force     of the magnetic field is maintained constant.

explain,        "simply        by  inertia and       pressure,"       the   rotation      of the

light     transmitted          through     heavy      glass    in   a   powerful      magnetic
field along the lines of force.                In my Baltimore Lectures I                showed
that embedded gyrostats would in fact produce exactly the                               rotation
of the        plane     of polarisation         in  a   magnetic field discovered hj
Faraday.            The    idea      which     forms     the    subject of        the    present
communication shows                  how the fly-wheels of the gyrostats maybe
started       into rotation in virtue of the generation of the                        magnetic
field and stopped              when the magnetic field is annulled.

store up in themselves the                      total energy thus radiated out.                        Taking
now            as    gyrostat our electric doublet of vitreously-electrified rigid
hollow              ring filled with fluid resinously electrified, consider what
must be              the nature of the          elastic communication between                         it   and a
rigid lining of              a    spherical hollow in ether around                   it,   to    fulfil     some
of the known                 conditions of radiant molecules.
   §      6.
                    (a.) Let the spring connection be equivalent                             to   a        simple
 force between   the centre of inertia of ring and fluid, and O, the
                          I,
 centre of the spherical sheath, varying directly as the distance
 between             those points.         The gyrostatic influence will be inoperative,
 and the result will                  be precisely the same as                 if   we had a single
 Maxwell-Sellmier material point                        at   I,   of mass equal to that of ring
 and fluid            together.
     (]>.)          Let points    on the ring be connected                  by springs with points
 on the sheath.                  Supposing       now     the      sheath     to be held fixed,                the
 stiffnesses           and    the    tensions     of these springs may be adjusted                              to
 give      21 arbitrary values                for the co-efficients           in the quadratic for
 the potential               energy       of any infinitesimal             displacement, specified
 by three             components       of linear displacement of                I,   and        three com
 ponents of rotational displacement round axes through                                             I.        The

  incompressible             fluid in the ring, gives us immediately the periods
  and geometrical specifications of six fundamental modes of simple
  harmonic vibration.                  Hence our combination, serving                       as    a   radiant
  molecule, without                 magnetic       force       would       give six        bright           lines
  (understood of course that each of the six periods  within the                        is
  range of light-periods).  Suppose  now    vast number of such        a
  molecules,           all equal and similar in every respect but with different
  orientations, to be scattered                    through         a   flame.       Each          molecule,
  whatever            its orientation, will give six lines of the same periods,
  though of different intensities                      when seen in any particular direc
  tion,    according to             the      chances     of orientation          and       of impulses.
  Hence         each of the six bright                 lines will be perfectly sharp.

of our six fundamental modes of vibration into two, greater                               thru:

different values of          6  for their different orientations.              Hence each
bright line is not split into two sharp                  lines, but is broadened to an
extreme       breadth corresponding to the value                6 = 0.    No   simplifying
suppositions       as to the character         of the molecule,       such  as   symmetry
of forces and moments              of inertia round the axes of the ring,                  can
possibly give Zeeman's normal results of the splitting                        of   a bright
lino into two sharp lines circularly polarised                   in opposite    directions,

magnetic       force   ;  and    the dividing       of each bright line into           three,
each    plane     polarised, when the light is viewed from                     a   direction
perpendicular to the lines of force.                      Hence, although from          1856
till quite lately I felt            satisfied     in    knowing      that it   sufficed      to
explain Faraday's magneto-optic                   discovery,    I  now, in the light          of
Zeeman's        recent      discovery,      discard my old tempting              gyrostatic
hypothesis for an irrefragable reason, which is virtually                         the   same
us    that stated       by Larmor* in the             following     words:  — "Hence           a
principal      oscillation      which     is   thus magnetically tripled           must      be
capable of being excited with reference                  to any axis    in the molecule:
otherwise there           would    be merely        hazy    broadening or duplies         ti'-n
instead of definite triplication."
    ^ 8.    It  now seems to me that the theory of H. A. Lorcntf
(<>f   Leyden),      as expressed      by equations         (1) in Zeeman's first pnpeT
 "On      the   Intluence      of Magnetism           on    the Nature of the Light

   It is now well known that after reunion of a divided                         nerve by
means of suture, function may return sooner                      or later, and that     do:
only   does      this restoration        of function         imply     simple return of
sensation      and of the        capacity of making             voluntary    movements,
but the re-establi.-hment           of complete       localisation of sensation         and
of co-ordination           of movement*.           When       it is remembered         that
the individual       nerve fibres are supposed            to be paths between         well-
defined    centres and peripheral endings,                it is clear that     so perfect
a  restoration of function           is in many respects           remarkable.       Thus,
in coapting        a  divided      nerve,   it   is   not likely that this         can be
effected    with     so great     accuracy,     that the corresponding            ends of
the divided        nerve fibres can be brought into apposition.                       It   is
more    likely that in coapting           the nerve, most           of the ends     of the
nerve fibres which are brought into contact are ends which                                do
not   correspond       ;    and thus it would             be    expected    that in      the
reunited      nerve      new paths for         the     nervous impulses would             be
established.         And yet,       despite    this complexity of structure             and
of function, the reunited nerve seems to be                       as  capable   as before
the division of subserving its functions.
    In suturing divided          nerves,   care is usually given to secure             that
the two segments             are approximated          as  nearly    as possible  in  their
old relationship.           Thus, the perfect recovery of localised               and    co
ordinated function might be due to                  a  majority of the fibres        being
thus placed        in    a   position   for    union      as   before the division         to
take place.
    To investigate this subject, three experiments were                        performed
on dogs,       the    sciatic nerve being chosen.                 In two     experiments

the peripheral segment,           before    reunion by means of suture,         was
twisted so as to bring the maximum number of non-corresponding
nerve fibre ends into juxtaposition,             while in the third experiment
reunion was made as accurately in the old position as possible.
   The object of this was to ascertain           : —
    1st.  If   the time taken for the first evidence              of recovery      of
co-ordinated movements,            and the course        of development of the
same, were identical or different in the two cases.
   2nd.    If   the resulting cicatricial      nerve segments     showed micro
scopically any important            differences    in the    arrangement of the
nerve fibres.
   In all     three   experiments, the animal being anaesthetised,               the
sciatic nerve       was divided     at the level of the trochanter         ; but in
the first two, before coapting the two ends by suture,              the peripheral
segment      was    rotated to the       extent of a semicircle.          Thus, on
coaptation,      the   fibres  of one side       of the central segment        were
brought into apposition with fibres with which formerly they did
not connect, i.e., the fibres of the opposite             side of the nerve.      In
the third experiment the nerve               was    divided at the same point,
and accurate      coaptation in     the old relationship effected by suture.
   The following         is the course which the experiments exhibited,
with   reference     to recovery of function.

         of peripheral     segnierd to extent    of semicircle and    suture.
   Until the 7th         day  after the operation, the animal showed no
sign of returning function.              It  walked on the limb, which was
supported       by   plaster   of    Paris    bandages.      The   paw was      left
unsupported        for examination        purposes,    and until the     7th   day,
while tho animal walked on the limb, the paw was dragged along
the ground dorsal surface down.                 But   on the 7th day the paw
was   first used       normally    in walking, the plantar         surface    being
placed correctly on the          ground.      This was taken      as evidence     of
returning      co-ordinated movements.             Frequently,    while walking,
the paw turned over, and the animal rested on the dorsal surface,
but on these occasions the normal position was voluntarily regained
after a step or two.

    Restoration of localised sensation could not be ascertained,                  bat
undoubted evidence of sensation            was obtained on the 10th day.
    On the 14th         day the supporting        plaster of Paris splint         was
removed, and the wound was                found healed.        The animal       then
used the leg perfectly, almost always placing               the   plantar   surface
of the paw on the ground correctly.
    ISy the 19th day the          dog had    practically completely recovered
from the effects of the operation.
    On the 54th day the nerve, was again               exposed,    and was found
united in the position in which it had been sutured.                  Stimulation
above, below, and on the seat of reunion              gave the normal contrac
tions in the muscles of the leg.
Exp.   II. — Division of       sciatic nerve at level of trochanter:       rotation
         of peripheral     segment to extent    of semicircle and    suture.
    In  a few days the animal was walking about on its splinted                  leg,
but dragging the paw along the ground dorsal surface down.
    On the 7th day it was first noticed that the plantar                 surface of
the paw was correctly placed, and, although occasionally                    turning
over    on    the   dorsal   surface,    was  on   these  occasions     voluntarily
replaced     in position after two or three steps.
     By the 21st day distinct evidence of sensation                was   exhibited,
and the recovery of the normal use of the limb was practically
 complete.
     The physiological        examination     of the nerve      on  the   30th day
 showed     it  to be united in the position in which        it  was sutured, and
 to have regained its normal irritability and conductivity.

     On the 7th day the animal first showed signs                  of recovery      of
 function,     as, for the first time, it was then noticed that it           walked
 placing the plantar .surface of the paw on the ground.                 It was    not,
 however, able to voluntarily           readjust the paw when it          happened
 to   turn     over   with the dorsal surface down.             This   power     was,
 however, exhibited on the following            day.

   By      the    11th day evidence                 of sensation          was obtained, and by
the 14th day            the recovery of function was complete.
   On the          -19th     day the physiological                 examination            showed that
reunion of          the      nerve had          taken       place      both       anatomically           and
phj-siologically.
   As regards recovery of function,                         therefore,        these       three     experi
ments followed             a practically identical course.
   The microscopic examination of                          the throe       sciatic nerves showed
the following           characters.
   The central             segments        showed the characters                        of the      normal
sciatic    nerve,       except     in     so   far that the            lymphatic          spaces      wore
somewhat          distended, thus              accounting           for    the     increased         thick
ness      of the        nerve     which        was      macroscopic-ally               evident.       This
character         was      maintained          to    within        5      mm.      of     the     seat    of
section.
   The peripheral             segments         agreed      in showing no old nerve fibres
in any part examined, either                   close to the seat of reunion, or in the
terminal         divisions of the nerve.                   In their        place       were     abundant
young      nerve       fibres with well-defined                  characters.           Lying between
the young nerve fibres were degeneration remains of the old fibres,
showing that Wallorian degeneration had taken place.
   The cicatricial           segments      were also all three               practically identical
in structure.           In   no case could continuity                  of nerve fibres from the
central to the peripheral                  segment          be    traced     in    a    single section.
The arrangement of the young                        fibres was very irregular, the libres
running      a very tortuous course,                    and showing,              therefore,        in the
section cut in all directions.                      The sections           closely resembled             the
appearance        of    a neuroma.

   1st.

640                Proceedings of Royal Society              of Edinburgh.                      [««.
restoration            of conductivity        and of voluntary            function        may
effected      in   a   few days.
   2nd.     That this early restoration of conductivity                        need not be        the
result of reunion of the old nerve fibres, i.e., reunion by sc-calloi
first intention, or without Wallerian degeneration, but may                                 be tie
result     of regeneration of young                     nerve fibres in the             peripheral
segment.
   3rd.    That          voluntary      co-ordinated        movements             are    regained
equally       soon,       whether      the two ends of the divided                      nerve     are
united     as   accurately       as possible,      so as to bring        the corresponding
ends     of the nerve fibres                into contact    as    nearly       as possible,        or
whether, previous to reunion, the peripheral segment is twisted                                    so
that, when united               to the central segment,          non-corresponding              er:di
of the nerve fibres are brought into contact.
  4th.     That         in the latter case the microscopic examination                             of
the    seat     of reunion         leaves     it doubtful     whether          the restoration
of function            is due    to   the    re-establishment of the old paths                    by
decussation            in the nerve         cicatrix,   or to the reunion of              ends     of'
nerve     fibres which do not correspond,                    but which          happen      to     be
brought into apposition.
   5th. That in suturing              a     divided nerve no trouble need               be taken
to secure          that coaptation of the two segments                    is   effected    in    the
old relationship, the simple approximation                            of the two        ends,     no
matter in what relationship, being all that                      is   required.

 Dr     O. von Linstow*           described two new tapeworms,                   which      he
 named Tetrabothrium            torulosum      and T. aurirulatum.            The resem
 blance of the head of T. aurirulatum                  with that of Prosthecocotyle
 Forsteri described by Montieelli t seemed to rue                       to indicate that
 the Tetraliothrium described by Linstow probably                      belonged       to the

   The genus ProstJtecocotyle                        may           be characterised as follows                    :   —
The     head, without rostellum and hooks, has a quadrangular shape,
which is caused by the singular structure of the suckers.                                                       Each
sucker shows the                   peculiarity          of having               on     the    outmost end a
lateral protrusion,                which has the same histological                                 structure          as

begins not very far behind                           the head,                and      the      segments          are
always         shorter than           broad,         except             the     last    segments           on     the
posterior end.              The morphology of the genital organs also shows

The vagina passes directly from the ventral side of the cirrus to

  succeeding     one.       All   the specimens          that   I   had occasion to        sta-ij
  were    strongly contracted.              The measurements             given above        hare
  therefore no absolute value, for they vary according to the                            degree
  of the contraction of the animal.                  The scolex is unarmed, withoa
  rostellum and hooks          ;  it   has the typical shape of the head of ths
  Prosthecocotyle        species.       The head differs from the drawing                    pub
  lished by O. Linstow,              as   may be seen         by comparing         fig.   17 of
  Linstow with my            fig.   1   drawn      with    Abbd's drawing          apparatus.
  The scolex is         1  mm.     wide and about            2    mm.     long.    Its    shape
 is   quadrangular.           This      singular form is produced by the pr>
 trillions of    the suckers characteristic of             all  Prosthecocotyhe.         These
 aro the     suckers      that exhibit         anteriorly and externally ear-shaped
 protrusions, which have the same structure                         as  the  suckers.       Tin
 suckers     with their small openings lie              on the dorsal and ventral side
 of the scolex      ;   they are oval, with            a  long diameter of 0-34 mm.
 and a transverse diameter of 0-23                   mm.      They touch one another
 in the median line of the head, and are very powerful                             and deep.
 Unhappily,      I  cannot give information on the histological structure
 of this interesting scolex, because                I   could not make sections of            it
 Neither can      I   state whether the            posterior part behind the           head is
 normal.
     The segments, which are very short and thick, and separated by
 a deep     incision, are covered            by the cuticula and the subcuticular
 layer of colls.       The cellular structure of the parenchyma is distinct
 everywhere;        it  is not crossed over by muscular fibres.                   We find it
 so   in the lateral extremities of the internal                      parenchyma       and in
 the    cirrus-pouch.         The     calcareous      corpuscles       are found specially
 in the external parenchyma, but also between                           the muscles and in
 the intermediate          layer of parenchyma situated between                      two   seg
 ments.       In the ripe        segments       they are particularly           numerous in
 the lateral parts of the internal parenchyma, where one can study
 their development out of the cells of the parenchyma.
     We find directly under               the   cuticula    a  simple layer of        circular
and longitudinal            fibres.       In the parenchyma we                discover     two
layers of longitudinal           muscles.        The external stratum is formed              by
small bundles of spindular                  fibres   (ca.   10    fibres).     This thickly
laid stratum of muscles                envelops completely the central part                   of
the     segment,      and is       only interrupted          at    the    point   where     the

genital canals         pass out.      They     go through      the   strobila     without
diminishing        in thickness at the limits of the                segments.         This
muscular layer, which has a thickness of 0'038 mm., touches the
cuticula only at the limits of the segments, and it follows from
this disposition that the external parenchyma of each segment is
completely separated.             The external muscular layer is much more
powerful.        It   consists of bundles (diameter 0-114 mm.) formed by
fifty fibres     at the utmost.         This stratum of longitudinal              muscles
is separated from the external layer by               a  small zone of parenchyma,
and only interrupted for a short space on both sides of the strobila.
Inside of the longitudinal             muscles     we find a layer of transverse
muscles.        In   the lateral part of the strobila these muscles radiate
only in the          external    parenchyma,         and fix     themselves        on the
cuticula of the anterior side of the segments.                      The dorso-ventral
fibres are specially situated where they are not disarranged by the
development of the genital glands, and are therefore mostly found
in   the lateral sides         of the    proglottis     and between the different
segments.         These fibres can, without              doubt, modify the depth
of the incision between the segments.                       As to the form of the
fibres,   we find        it differs in    the    different   systems.        The dorso-
ventral     fibres    are very long and fine.             The transverse       fibres  are
also very long.           The longitudinal fibres are, on the contrary, short
and thick.
    We could only study             the water-vascular       system    in the strobila.
The two pairs of longitudinal                 vessels   are  placed    one    above    the
other   ;  the dorsal one has        a diameter of about 0-01 mm.          ; the   ventral
one is much better developed,               and is 0"06 mm. wide.             The vessel
that joins the ventrals has             a  diameter of 0-032 mm.             The water-
vascular system has a very peculiar structure, the vessels having                         a
powerful       musculature which            transforms this system          into    a con
tractile organ.           The dorsal vessel is especially muscular, and thus
varies much in size.            On the ventral vessel the circular and longi
tudinal fibres are neatly developed,                 but each one is represented
by a simple stratum.                 Such a complex musculature has never
been      noticed       in   the water-vascular          system     of   the     cestodes.

      As   the segments            are separated       by  a deep     incision, the opening
  of the genital cloaca is situated on the left and anterior side                                  of
  the    proglottis.          The genital cloaca          itself is wrinkled,         and lined
 by the continuation of the cuticula of the body.                             On the walls         oi
 the      cloaca      are    fixed     numerous        muscles      descending         from     the
 transverse          musculature.             These muscles        have      the function         of
 ilattening        out     the    cloaca   ;   they are therefore expanders of                  the
 genital cloaca.             At    the  bottom of the cloaca a long canal leads
                                                                       '

 described by me in Tamia depresmj                           This ductus         has therefore
 a    powerful circular            and   longitudinal      musculature, surrounded              by
 numerous         nuclei pertaining             to myoblasts, and parenchyma cells.
 Through        this canal         the  cirrus passes to the outside.               The cirrus-
 pouch, being spherical, has the typical shape of the ProtthKOtotyk
 genus.       The wall of this organ is 0-018 mm. thick.                          The internal
 part consists           of circular,        the   external    of longitudinal          muscles.
 Inside this organ is the short vas deferens,                          which     is enveloped
 by a feeble musculature.                 The penis is unarmed.             The vas     deferens
 passes nearly in a straight lino under the nerve and between the
 two vessels of the water-vascular system.                       A   series of circumvolu

the nuclei of young egg-cells occurs at the bottom of                          the ovarian
tubes (slightly swelled at their extremity). It is here                        that during
a   sliort      time    new eggs are produced.             The vagina    begins      on the
¦ventral       side of the cirrus-pouch, and            runs nearly in    a   straight line
in the       middle of the median field to join the oviduct.                    This canal
dilates on two points of its course. The fust widening is longish
but not very considerable; it is probably the receptaculum seminis,
 in which 1 could not lind spermatoids,* also the structure is not
 the same that one generally finds in the other cestodes for the
 same organ. The second widening, very short, is nut far from
  the point where the vagina rejoins the oviduct. The structure is
  the same as that of the vagina, but with a much more powerful
  longitudinal and circular musculature. The oviduct begins with
  a very well developed muscular funnel. This funnel is carpeted
   inside by an epithelium. From this organ the oviduct goes to
   meet the vagina, forming distinct circumvolutions (tig. 3). The
    oviduct is very wide, and carpeted by an epithelium, formed
    partly by columnar cells, out of which issue long cilia. From the
    point where the oviduct meets with the vagina, it becomes very
    narrow.         It descends towards the shell-glands, and it is there
    that the vitelloduct throws itself into the oviduct. The small and
    slightly vitelligenous gland is the sexual gland which is situated
    before    the ovary, as in all the Prurthtmrutyliv.                 From the shell-
    glands    the    oviduct leads in        a  straight line towards the dorsal         side
    of the proglottis,         where    it opens into the uterus.         The uterus        is
    therefore      situated     on the dorsal      side of the ovary.       Its  most con
    siderable      diameter       is  in   the    median    line of   the     strobila  ;   it
    diminishes       promptly laterally, where it passes between                 the longi
    tudinal     vessels of the excretory system.              This conformation of the
    uterus is found in the segments                 where the sexual     glands are still
     well  developed.         It  is in this state that the uterus        is carpeted      by
     very  high cells.         When     the uterus is distended with            eggs,  these
     cells suffer     a  granular degeneration         of which we find the remains
     between the        eggs.    Are these granules used to nourish the eggs
     which arc for       a long time devoid of an envelope,            even when they
     have already begun             their segmentation      1   Or  do   they     help tho

    A   serious   comparative study of the originals of T. auri--u]a/um
 and of Diesing's       examples      of T.   ht  teroditum has shown               me that
 the two species       are identical.       This interesting          Taenia    was found
in the intestines of Thalassoeca              glaeialo'ides,       Smith, and Dapticm
 capensu      (Linn.).       According     to   Linstow,         the    animal attains        a
 length of 112 mm.         ;  the   scolex is 0'48 mm. in breadth and                   0'34
 mm. in length.         According to my measurement                   the breadth of the
head     is of 0'3S mm.           The powerful        suckers        occupy almost the
whole of the         scolex,    and   each    one    exhibits        anteriorly     and   ex
 ternally    an   ear-shaped       protrusion.

a   great    thickness    as    P. torulom, but         is, on the        contrary,     very
flat.    Also the proglottides are         a  little longer than in           that species,
but the separation        of the proglottides is equally distinct,                 and    the
separation     between     each segment       reaches the longitudinal             muscles.
In    the external      parenchyma numerous calcareous                     corpuscles     are
found.      The internal parenchyma is reduced by the development
of the sexual glands.
   Besides the subcuticular musculature, which shows nothing very
remarkable, we find, as in            P. torulosa,     a    double zone of          bundles
of longitudinal muscles, the external ones of which are less                        strong.

     The external            zone is continuous, which means that it is only in
terrupted at the point where                          the sexual         organs      pass out.           The
internal        zone is confined to the ventral and dorsal surfaces.                                      On
the internal side of the longitudinal musculature                                 lies a feeble layer
of     transverse        muscles,        which assists the formation of the com
plicated musculature surrounding the terminal part of the sexual
canals.         The dorso-ventral musculature                       is feeble.
     The    nervous system              consists in the strobila of two longitudinal
nerves which             are situated          on     the outside            of the water-vascular
system.
     The    vascular system, which               I    could only study in the segments, is
situated rather far from the lateral side (in a proglottides 1-65 mm.
in diameter the vascular system is 0-4 mm. distant from the side).
It consists of two ventral                     vessels and two dorsal vessels                       placed
above the first.              These two pairs of vessels are surrounded,                                 as    in
P. torulosa, by           a musculature.               The ventral vessels are joined in
every segment by               a large vessel.
     The      male sexual           glands are composed of 28 testicles situated                              on
the dorsal side of the internal                       parenchyma.               The vas deferens               is
very long, and presents numerous convolutions converging towards
the    left    side, that is to say, the side                      on    which issues the sexual
canals in all the Prostltecocotyloe.                            The interpretations of the male
sexual        apparatus         given by Linstow                   are    inexact, which            is    due
 probably          from the fact that this author did not make sections.
 The cirrus-pouch, into which enters the vas deferens,                                        presents a
 form       and    a    structure which              is,   so    to speak, identical         in all the
 species of Prosthecocotyle.                     It    is       spherical,    and     contains      a         vas
 deferens       with thick walls.                The cirrus, which              is   very long, passes
 through the canal that                 I     called in the description of                  P.    torulosa,
'
     male     cloacal     canal.'         This      canal,       having the         shape    of    a     very
 prominent papilla, has, as well as the genital cloaca,                                     into which
it    enters,   a   complex structure.                 The papilla and cloaca are carpeted
  by   the continuation of the cuticula of the body.                                  Their muscular
 system       is   composed of internal circular fibres and of others with                                     a
 radial disposition.                 The whole        is   surrounded by         a   system       of fibres
 proceeding            from the transverse                 musculature of the parenchyma.
 So the whole presents, in transverse                               sections,    the structure of               a
 sucker       (figs.    6,

walls, the vagina passes out,                  on the ventral          side     of the mile
papilla.        The vagina is large            at the beginning, and surrounded
by    a   strong musculature, essentially formed                     by circular          fibres,
which cross each other.                At  the entrance       into the internal paren
chyma,       the    diameter       of the female         canal diminishes,           to swell
again     as soon as      it   has    passed the water-vascular system.                      The
 second     extension,     spindle-shaped, is equally muscular                   ; but here     it
 is the     longitudinal       fibres    which      prevail,     It   is    a   receptacul'ca
 se minis      similar to that of          P.    torul<>*a.      From        this point       the
 vagina     goes towards the middle of                 the    proglottis        to meet with
 the canal       that comes from the ovary.                 Before joining, the canal
 narrows suddenly, presenting at this point a stronger musculature.
 It  is probably       a sphincter which prevents the spermatoids return
 ing.     The sexual glands are composed of an ovary, lobed, situated
  ventrally,      and    occupying        all   the    length     and breadth           of   the
 parenchyma placed between                  the water-vascular system.                 At    the
  origin of its canal is situated           a  muscular funnel          :  an egg-aspirator.
 The viteliigenous gluul, situated in the middle, lies ventrally,                            and
 is small     ;  it is placed before          the ovary.         Where        the  vitelloduct
  meets the oviduct          is to be found a shell-gland                  from which        the
  canal    runs towards the dorsal              side to open into the uterus, winch
  has the same shape             as  in  P. torulosa       (tig.  7).      In    the last pro
  glottides the uterus rills the whole internal parenchyma.                            I   could
  not   study the        hooks of the embryo,                the eggs not          being in     a
  sufficiently advanced           state.    As     I had not the last proglottides,
  I cannot say if there are three shells surrounding the eggs.
     It  is  very probab'e         that in this species the fecundation                  of the
  eggs is often produced              by the male organ of the same proglottid;
  but the very complex disposition of the musculature of the cloaca,
  and     the    peculiar development of the male                   papilla, lead        me    to
  believe      that fecundation may also take                  place      between     different
  proglottides.

 On the Vascular System of the Hypocotyl and Embryo
       of Ricinus Communis, L. By Edith Chick, B.Sc,
       Quain    Student    in    Botany,       University   College,    London.
       (With Three Plates.)
                              (Read June 19, 1899.)
    Sections   of the hypocotyl of Ricinus communis              are frequently
 examined    as typical of the young stem, in which widely separated
 vascular bundles are ultimately united by            a band of interfascicular
 cambium,    and this by giving          rise  to secondary   tissues   connects
the xylems and phloems         of the primary bundles to form concentric
 continuous rings.
   In   the young unthickened hypocotyl            of Ricinus  there   are eight
such bundles connected          by   a  continuous starch sheath        and one
layer of smaller cells       immediately inside it.         In  some    sections,
however,    confusion arises owing to the increase of the number of
vascular bundles, and in the           case   of older hypocotyls these extra
bundles are embedded         in the cambium ring and have rather the
appearance     of secondarily formed tissues.
   It  was in the first instance to clear up the origin of these bundles
that, at the suggestion       of Professor F. W. Oliver, the following
work was begun.        Afterwards, as there seemed some advantage in
working out in full the arrangement             of the vascular system in this
plant, which is    so frequently     used as a    dicotyledonous type, it has
been followed     from the root, through the hypocotyl, to the 1st
and 2nd internodes of the epicotyl.
   The    well-developed primary           root of the    seedling of     Ririnis
communis      averages   about     2    mm.    in diameter.     About    5   mm.
below the junction with the stem it enlarges rapidly to attain the
diameter of the hypocotyl, which varies between                  4  and  5   mm.
It  is from this swollen portion of the root that most               of the first
developed    lateral rootlets take their origin.          They appear at the
surface   at points corresponding to the position of the proto-xylems
within, and form four vertical rows corresponding with the tetrarch
symmetry      of the root cylinder.           The   hypocotyl   tapers   slightly

from its junction with the root to the level at which the cotyledons
arise.    The first pair of leaves are opposite and decussate with the
cotyledons    ;  the subsequent     leaves are alternate.
    As in   the following      descriptions references        will frequently         be
necessary to the plane passing through the junction of the hypocotyl
and root, it seemed well to use         a definite term to designate this.
    The   term     'collet'   has been used by some            writers*      to mean
the whole region in which the transition from root to stem structure
(internal as well as external) takes place.           Later writers t use the
term to designate the geometrical plane passing through the region
at which       the   piliferous   layer of the      root     gives    place     to   the
epidermis of the hypocotyl.
    In Ricinus it     is immediately below the
                                                      '
                                                         collet,' using the word
in this latter     sense, that lateral roots also are given        off;   so   that in
this case the term denotes a plane separating all the external stem
characteristics from those of the root.
                              The Primary Boot.
    Gerard   J   states   that the bundles of the root vary from four to
eight, and that out of ten specimens            examined five were tetrarch,
two were pentarch, two had seven and one had eight xylems and
phloems.        However, in twenty-one specimens               examined       I   found
only one varying from the tetrarch type                 ;  this one was clearly
abnormal, and, since it presented several            points of interest, will be
described later.
    Near the root tip the centre of the cylinder is occupied by the
fused bases of the four xylem bundles.                  Approaching        the collet
this position is taken by the pith.
    Passing outwards the xylem and phloem are quite normal in
 their characters and call for no remark.
    The poricycle forms wedge-shaped              masses, eight to         nine cells
 deep   from apex to base, opposite          the protoxylems        ;  and narrows
 down until it consists of one or sometimes                two layers of cells to
 the outside of the phloem arc.

in the          small    celled       tissue    opposite        the     primary        phloems,        and
secondary          xylem      is formed centrifugally                   in this position.              The
cambium thus forms                a   ring broken by the four xyloms.                     At a        la'.e:
stage the perieycle cells                 outside       the protoxylems divide tangenti-
ally    to form a cambium                  which bridges across                  the gap.        The=e
divisions do not take place                      in the cells immediately outside the
protoxylem, and there are usually                          a    few crushed perieycle cells
to be seen between                 it   and      the    secondarily formed tissues.                   The
cambium          ring is now complete,                  and forms secondary xylem and
phloem normally.
     Following          the   root upwards, near the collet certain cells of the
perieycle        opposite     the phloems            divide to form        a    cork cambium.
                         Passage        prom         Root to Hvpocotyl.
     The passage from the root structure to that of the                                   stem takes
place    in     the space of a few millimetres                   in the swollen root portion
mentioned above.                  A   section at the collet shows eight typical stem
bundles with their protoxylems directed towards the centre; and
considering everything above the collet as stem and that below
as   root   ;    the transition         from root to stem takes place entirely in
the root.
     The plant from which                      the     following        observations were         made
was young, the cotyledons being still                            in     the seed ; the root was
rather more than              4   cm.   in length,        and    the     passage occupied about
 9   mm.
     Passing upwards to this region, the four xylem bundles, which
in the unthiekened root are narrow and conical (fig. 1),                                        become
gradually broader at the base and of less radial depth (fig.                                    2).
       At length        the four bases form               a     nearly continuous ring            round
the pith, and the protoxylems                          are drawn down to the middle                      of
 each bundle.             The appearance               at this stage       is   that of eight    xylem
bundles lying with their long axes directed tangentially and                                     joined
two and two by their protoxylems                                (fig.    3).     The    four    phloem

1898-99.]          Edith Chick on Ricinus Communis.                           655
bundles     have     not changed       their  position, nor do     they     do so
throughout      the passage.
    The next     stage is the      separation   of the eight xylem bundles
from    each   other, and at the same time a rotation as on               a  pivot
through     90° from a tangential to a radial direction, the                proto-
xylems     coming     to point towards the pith (fig. 4).        Thus the four
original xylem bundles          have    each split into two, and the halves
separating     come into contact with          the   halves from the original
xylem bundle        on either side ; the union taking         place in front of
the phloems (figs.         4 and   5).    There are now four typical stem
bundles, each, however, with             two distinct    protoxylems    (fig.   5).
The last stage is the splitting of these four bundles, half of the
original   phloem going to each (fig.            6).   In this way    the    eight
bundles of the hypocotyl appear.
    Exactly similar       stages could be made out in a microtome series
of transverse sections of an embryo dissected from an ungerminated
seed of Eicinus.
                    Gamostklt in an Abnormal Root.
    In external    appearance     the abnormal root mentioned above was
irregularly oval instead of being cylindrical.
    Xear the tip, sections        showed that, corresponding to the oval
form, the vascular system was composed of two typical root steles,
each   with   a normal pith, but the two inclosed by one               common
endodermis.
   A little higher up        the piths connected      across, and some of the
xylems and phloems were, in consequence,               pushed  to the outside.
Fresh bundles also entered from the lateral roots until the number
of xylem bundles was increased           from eight to ten, and later, by the
division of one to two, the number was further increased to eleven.
The phloems       formed irregular shaped patches between the xylem
bundles.
   The vascular cylinder          now had roughly the appearance             of  a
crescent, on the concave side of which the endodermis              had become
less distinct (fig.   7  (a) ).
   Higher up,      the   horns of the crescent       fused,  and a portion of
the   cortex was        inclosed.      By this time      the  concave    arc ol

endodermis       had quite lost its distinctive characters,            and the im
prisoned cortex had all the appearance of a normal pith.                     At this
stage the xylem bundles,              which were of very different size, con
sisted    of mingled larger and smaller tracheal elements, in which
it was impossible to determine the positions of the protoxylems                        :
it was consequently impossible to say when the root arrangement
ended,     and that of the stem began.             The positions,     and also the
numbers,      of the bundles were           always changing, due to fusions
and divisions.
   Just                   '         '
           before    the    collet     was reached,    the bundles, after much
shifting, arranged       themselves      symmetrically, and the section of the
false  stele was roughly a square, each side of which was occupied
by a typical stem bundle with two protoxylems pointing to the
centre, and the four angles            each by a group of small xylem vessels
(possibly protoxylem), which went off to lateral roots,                   and were
lost (fig.  7  (J)).
   Above this plane the structure conformed to the type normal
for the base of the hypocotyl, and the splitting of the four st«m
bundles gave the ordinary eight hypocotyledonary bundles.

   From      the     collet     the    eight hypocotyledonary         bundles     pass
upwards unbranched till within a few centimetres                      of the point
of origin of the cotyledon petioles.               The distance from the root
at   which     the    apparent branching         takes    place   depends    on    the
length of the hypocotyl.
    In a   well-grown specimen          the hypocotyl varies       between    12  and
25 cm. in length.
    In   the   case of     a   hypocotyl     15   cm.  long,    the  original   eight
bundles remained unbranched to                 a height of 10-5 cm.       ;  in one,
14-5    cm.   long, the      first appearance      of branching took place          at
about 10 cm. from the collet             ; and in the case described        in detail
below, the hypocotyl was 19 "5 cm., and branching first appeared
at 13 cm. above the 'collet.'

details.
      In     the specimen chosen for description, while the hypocotyl was
fully        elongated,          the epicotyl had reached                 a    length of less than
2     cm., two internodes only being visible.
      The dimensions were as follows : — tap root,                                   7    cm.          ;   hypocotyl,

      At     the base of the hypocotyl there was a broad active band of
interfascicular cambium, giving rise to secondary xylem and phloem
elements at various points in its circumference.                                          At          a distance      of

two          or      three       centimetres        from    the         collet            these            secondary
structures were no longer met with, although the cambium ring
was         still       broad.       From   this level upwards, the cambium                                         ring
became              gradually narrower, and at about 18 cm. from the collet
it had almost disappeared.
   In this specimen, also, it                    was possible           to follow the change                          of
the same layer of cells from the endodennis of the root to the
starch sheath                  of the hypocotyl.
      The layer retained its endodermal characters, i.e., its thickened
 radial walls, for nearly                2 cm.      in   the hypocotyl, and                  then,          with     the
 appearance               of starch,      at first in      small and higher up in larger
 quantities,             took on the characteristics of             a   typical starch sheath.

      In this           specimen,      at 13 cm. from the collet,                        the first signs               of
 branching appeared.                     In four    out of the eight bundles (tig. 10 — 1,

 the plane passing                   through the cotyledons), the phloem becomes
 divided            to three     ;   one central large         mass, and one smaller one on
 either side.
      The lateral phloem masses leave the central one                                             ;    immediately
 afterwards               lateral portions of the xylem also break away, and two
 lateral          branch bundles are completely separated                                 from the central
 one        (fig.       11).
       In the remaining four bundles                        (fig.   10 — 2,          3,      6,        7), a similar
    branching            takes   place    on one side only of each ; there                                   is,   there

there      are, at this level,                  eight hypocotyledon               bundles and twehe
others, the result of branching (fig. 11). The subsequent history
of these bundles is as follows: — At about 15 cm. from the eolkt,
the     twelve bundles unite two and two,                                    and the single                  bundle?
formed from those fusions take                                up an intermediate position                           be
tween adjacent main hypocotyledonary                                    bundles.
     Just       above        this level, however, there is given off from each of
the bundles           2      and     6 one       small branch which takes up                            a   position
midway, i.e., in the plane of the cotyledons, between                                                   bundles         2
and        3    and      6    and    7    (a,    /?,   fig.   12).      In    some       other spreimens
bundles         3    and      7    also contributed branches to a and                             ft,   but    these
were much loss important                         than those from             2   and     G.     The bundles
a and          f$   are much smaller than the other similarly                                   situated          six,
and continue unbranched until                           just below        the point of insertion                      of
the cotyledon petioles                   ;   there they each break up to three                              or more
reduced bundles (fig. 14 and fig. 8), which leave the central ring
and form the vascular system of an axillary bud found in the
axil of the cotyledon, and sometimes                                  attached         to the axis of the
plant, sometimes to the cotyledon petiole.
      To       return to the other six united branch                                   bundles, at al*mt
15     cm. from              the    collet (fig.        8,    X, Y),     these         divide again,           each
giving off two lateral branches (fig. 13). About     cm. higher up                      2
the original eight hypocotyledonary bundles begin to move out from
the     central ring, four supplying                           each    cotyledon             petiole.         These
eight bundles take with them to the petioles                                     eight arcs of starchy
endodermis, together with the small-celled conjunctive surrounding

side.          These branches run obliquely up the petiole and                                      anastomose
as    indicated in fig. 15.                     At   the lateral margins of the petiole two
longitudinally                running         bundles are            formed       as     a     result        of   the
anastomosis.                 Fig.    15      represents        the branching             and       anastomosis
as    taking place in one plane, while in reality                                it    occupies          a   length
of several millimetres, and occurs                            irregularly so that             a   symmetrical
arrangement              is   never seen in any given section.
      Precisely the same branching was made                                      out    in    the cotyledon
petioles of          a   very young germinating plant (of which                                 a       microtome
series was cut), whose cotyledons were                                still within       the testa.

             Arrangement of Bundles in the Epicotyl.
   Even before       the cotyledon traces       leave     for the petioles,      the
groups of three bundles between them, of which the central one is
always the largest, increase their number by divisions.                After     the
bundles a and /? and the branches arising from them have moved
out from the stele, there is a gap left corresponding to their posi
tions.     To fill this up, there is a branching         in  sometimes   one and
sometimes     both of the groups adjacent to the gap at a much lower
level than in the case of the other groups.            In  the present specimen
branching took place in the groups between cotyledon traces                  1  and
2  and   5  and  6  at about  1 6*5  cm. from the collet, and the median
members of the group divided to two.             These two still being larger
than the lateral members of the same group.                  In the other groups
division usually takes place in the lateral members, these remaining
much smaller than the central one (fig. 14).
   The divisions do not take place regularly,                  nor at the     same
level (fig. 8 and fig. 16), but there is a certain uniformity               in the
arrangement of the bundles in every specimen                     examined.       By
means of the more active divisions in the groups                between   1  and   2
and    5  and   6,  enough   bundles are formed, so that by a general
shifting the gaps in the plane of the cotyledons are filled up                ; one
of the larger bundles of each of these groups moving round to take
up the central position.         As   a result,  the larger bundles are now
arranged more or less regularly round the circle.
   These large bundles leave the stele simultaneously for the first
pair of leaves which are decussate            with    the cotyledons,    approxi
mately half going to each leaf.          Again lateral shifting takes place
to  fill the  spaces left by these bundles.           Of    the smaller bundles
remaining, all are not of the same size, some being larger and more
fully developed than         others.     These larger         bundles  are    again
arranged at approximately regular intervals round the stele.
   Subsequent leaves are alternate,          but each is supplied by these
larger bundles situated all round the stem.                 These starting from
the side opposite the leaf progressively leave the cylinder and anasto
mose to form a nodal plexus which runs completely round the stem,
and gives off branches to the petiole             (figs.   17 and 17a).        (Thu

    In every     case the     bundle reaches its greatest            development          jart
as  it leaves the stele for its respective           leaf.
    Lestiboudois,*         in  a   paper    on   vascular      anatomy, figures an!
describes     among       others the hypocotyl of Rinnus communis.                          He
mentions the eight cotyledon traces of the hypocotyl, and refers                              to
the bundles a, b,      c,  etc. (fig. 8), as belonging to the first pair of leaves,
but does not mention their branching, and he apparently considers
continuations of the cotyledon traces to pass on upwards to                                the
epicotyl.       The rest of his remarks, which are almost impossible                         to
follow and understand, is concerned                with the arrangement              of    the
epicotyledonary bundles, to allow of                 a  phyllotaxy of       j   above the
first pair of leaves.
                Arrangement of Bundles in toe Embryo.
    To determine          at what stage in the development of the plant
these foliar bundles made their appearance, much younger specimens,
and finally embryos,           were examined.
    The whole of the branching bundle system, described                           above     in
the     fully elongated          hypocotyl,      was    already completed           in the
youngest seedlings           examined.        In one case (fig. 22) the cotyledons
                                       •
 were still     inside the testa         the length of hypocotyl             outside was
 19    cm.,    and inside       -2 cm.   (A. B.   fig. 22).     Into this      "2  cm. the
 whole course of the branching of the cotyledon bundles                          was com
 pressed, the details being exactly the same as those described                      above.
    Finally,    transverse      and longitudinal        microtome series          were cut
of embryos dissected from the Kicinus seed.
     In  the root     region of the embryo            the tetrarch arrangement of
the    adult plant could be distinguished,                  and  the.   arrangement of
 vascular    elements       in the passage from root to shoot,              as described
 above, was already laid down, though neither xylem                          nor phloem
 elements      were   fully differentiated.          In    the  hypocotyl       the   eight
cotyledon traces were distinctly visible, but everywhere the                         xylem
and phloem were only distinguishable                   by the relative      size of their
 elements    ;  it was impossible to make out sieve tubes, and                    even the
protoxylem elements were unthickened (fig. 24).

    The only bundles to be             seen     besides the primary eight were in
general those marked a and                b  in fig. 12, i.e., the median members
of    those   going    off to the first pair of leaves after the cotyledons
in the fully-grown plant.
    These 'bundles' were simply strands of smaller                            and    more
actively dividing cells than the rest of the tissue, and which had not
 even acquired the characteristic shape of the fully-formed                       bundle.
 On following         the    hypocotyl         upwards,     these   bundles a and         h
 appeared      suddenly between cotyledon traces                1  and 8 and 4 and 5
 (fig. 19), and in only one series out of five examined could anything
 approaching branching from these traces be made out.                              In  the
 others the bundles were quite unconnected with                          the    cotyledon
 traces.
     In   the   series   alluded     to,   however, a branch from             8 and    one
 from 4 took up positions midway between traces                         1   and 8 and 4
 and    5, and became       bundles a and          b respectively.     Following these
 bundles up towards the growing point, they are seen to continue
 on when the cotyledon traces leave the central ring, and afterwards
 pass into      the first    pair of leaves,          whose    rudiments are always
 present    (figs.   18 and      21).
     The embryos differed, however, in the amount of development
 of their tissues, and in some cases the procambial beginnings of
 some or all of the bundles c, d,              e, f could   be distinguished.       These
 in   a series cut from below upwards appear, however, later than
 the bundles a and           b ;  in fact, they are seen only just before the
 cotyledon traces leave for the petioles.
     Higher     up still, at the level of fig. 21, these extra procambial
 strands had quite disappeared,               and only a and        b were to be seen
 in the first pair of leaves.            In this      series the bundle       c  could be
 traced through eight sections, each 7 '5 fi in thickness, i.e., through
 a distance of '06 mm.
    In    an embryo of this stage the bundles a and                       b  attain their
 greatest development just below the level of the growing point,
 and such of the bundles c, d,              e,   / as  may occur are only found at
 this same level.
    In    a  transverse      section     of this region they appear              cut very
 obliquely, and are evidently in the act of passing outwards from
 the cone of apical meristem              to the circumference         of the vascular

and    /,     could be seen in the act of development in the region just
below the growing point (fig. 23).
  Hence, in the embryo the six bundles a,                                          b,      e,    d,   e,    and  /           are
developed              just below the growing point, and extend downwards
to the            hypocotyl            and     upwards     to    the        first pair of leaves                       ;     the
bundles           a    and     b     being ahead of the others               in their            development                      in
point of time.                   It   seemed also probable that the branches between
these         bundles and                the     adjacent cotyledon traces                            were           a    later
downward               development of these six.
     This idea was confirmed by an examination of the first                                                     branches
(figs. 10 and 11) in the very young germinated specimen                                                     mentioned
before (tig. 22).  Of the six bundles a,          and/,                h,   c,J,      e,                   it   was only
in a and               b   that thickened xylem                 elements          were           present;                at no
level were they to be seen in the later developed bundles                                                            e,  J,     ?,
and    /.
     Following                 the    branches     which fuse to form the bundle                                       a     up
from their connection with the cotyledon trace, they are                                                             seen       at
first to have no thickened elements                             at all.          Higher           up, thickening
on the xylem vessels                         occurs, the    number of such vessels                               and the
                                                                                                                              <.i
amount            of thickening increases                till   the branches                   anastomose and
is   formed.
     Hence the portion of the branch in connection with the                                                    cotyledon
trace        is   the youngest,          and the branch itself               is   a   downward                   develop
ment from a, and not                     a     branching in development from                               a   cotyledon
trace.
     We       conclude,              therefore, that the foliar bundles a,                            b,   c,   d,   e,   and

 conjunctive            tissue, the       former name             being applied to the larger
 celled parenchyma commonly                          present        in the centre of the stele,
 the latter to the tissue immediately investing the vascular ring.
 The external conjunctive may be divided into (1) pericyele, the
 peripheral layer of the stele (2) rays, the ti.-sue between the
                                                     ;
 bundles; and (3) perimedullary zone, the layer bordering the pith.
  The internal conjunctive                 is   equivalent to pith,          if   the latter term                is
  taken        to represent     a   naturally distinct tissue system, and                            is    not   a
  mere topographical designation for the tissue included within                                               an
  imaginary circle, whose circumference touches                                  the internal             points
  of the primary xylems.                        Flot's      scheme     corresponds           perfectly           to
  the facts in those cases where the primary bundles of the cylinder
  are separated           from one another laterally by narrow bands of tissue
  (rays).         He rightly            insists that        one     cannot       draw     a       sharp      line
  between perimedullary zone and ray, or between ray and pericyele,
  when the whole of the external conjunctive                                     is   parenchymatous.
  The three zones are in that                        case    simply topographical names for
  parts (whose limits are marked out by the bundles themselves)                                                  of
  a   single tissue          system        investing        the    bundles.           Histological           dis
  tinctions between them, however, frequently exist.                                   The commonest
  of these        is   the partial or complete              conversion of the pericyele into                       a
   sclerenchymatous band                  — a     conversion often shared                    by the peri
   medullary zone.

    The pericycle in the root proper is represented                    by   a band sf
varying thickness, consisting of layers of thin walled cells                     a little
smaller than those of the endodermis.                 Since the       outline     of th?
cylinder is circular, and the xylems are placed nearer the                        centre
 than the phloems,         these cells form wedge-shaped             masses eight to
 twelve     cells deep      opposite   the    protoxylems,        but   opposite       the
 primary phloems the pericycle narrows down to two, or in some
 cases   one layer between the outermost               point of the phloem             a:c
 and the endodermis.           The innermost vessels of the primary xylem
abut directly       on   the   large cells   of the pith      ;   the   phloems        are

    In  the phloem itself, even in quite           young specimens,          fibres are
 to  be   found.     These     are in many cases lying            side by   side    with
 sieve tubes and companion cells, and there               can be no doubt           as to
 their origin from the phloem, and not from the pericycle.                           The
 line of demarcation between          the two is quite clear (fig. 25).             This
occurrence       of fibres in the primary phloem of the root is                     rare,
 according to Van Tieghem,* who records them only in Legumino-
 sea; and    Malvales including      Malvacene,      Sterculiacere,    and Tiliace*,
 in certain of the Cycadese, and in Anona and Celtis.
    In  the transition region, after the split protoxylems have turned
 towards the centre of the cylinder, and the stele consistsof four double
 stem bundles (ligs. 5, 26), the interfascicular             pericycle     consists     of
 a  band of seven         to  eight, or even more,         layers of small           thin
 walled cells connecting these bundles, but not stretching                        down
 wards to their protoxylems.            This band      is in the position of          the
 wedge-shaped       mass of pericycle opposite        the protoxylem mentioned
 above, and it is from it that the lateral roots are seen to arise.
    In the root arrangement           the    protoxylems        are  surrounded        by
 small celled tissue (the pericycle).           Some of this remains in con
 nection with the protoxylem during its rotation, so that when the

  the interfascicular pericycle consists of two, or at most three, layers
  of small    cells inside the endodermis which now contains starch.
      On the other hand, the pericycle outside               the  phloem has not
  changed, and still consists of one or two layers of thin-walled cells
  external to the outermost         point of the phloem arc, but is thicker
   on the flanks of the bundles.            In somewhat older roots active cell
   division   is to be seen in the pericycle marking             the  beginning of

       In  the lower portion of the young unthickened                hypocotyl (i.e.,
   below the point of appearance             of the foliar traces), the pericycle
   is visible between any two of the eight cotyledon bundles                     as a
   single layer of small cells         immediately inside the starch sheath
   (fig. 27).
       In  longitudinal    section   the pericycle cells are seen to he elon
   gated, but with horizontal end walls, while the pith cells are much
   shorter and broader (fig. 28).           In both transverse and longitudinal
   sections    of  an  embryo     the   pericycle and pith presented exactly
   similar relations.      AVhen    the interfascicular      cambium arises, it is
   by tangential divisions in this layer of pericycle cells.
       The bulk of the 'primary ray' (in the old topographical sense)
   is occupied by a large celled tissue, on which the pericycle directly
   abuts, and which, following out           Plot's  idea, we must regard simply
   as   an   outward     extension     of    the   internal   conjunctive    or  pith
   (fig. 27).
       Opposite the bundle the pericycle is composed of tissue of two
   different kinds.      Immediately beneath           the  endodermis    is a layer
   of thin    walled cells containing starch, similar to, and continuous

 the sieve    tubes   of the phloem is a mass of cells, elongated                     and
 pointed as seen in longitudinal           section,    and   with but    a thin layer
 of protoplasm lining the wall of each.               These are the young peri-
 cyclic fibres.       The mass of fibres at           a  later stage is often          not
 continuous, but is broken            up to two or three divisions by                  the
interposition of parenchyma cells.
    Higher     up in the      hypocotyl      the    parenchymatous layer             men
 tioned above dies out, and the pericycle fibres come to lie                    directly
 within the endodermis.
    Pericycle     fibres are    also   found      to the    outside of the          foliar
 bundles a,    h, c, etc., the   number present         and the amount of          thick
 ening depending on the age of the hypocotyl                      and the level          at
 which the section is taken         ;  but these are always less than in              the
 case  of the cotyledon         traces.      The number of pericycle               fibres
increases    till  the oldest    part of the bundle is reached, i.e.,             at the
level at which it goes off to its respective leaf.
    To the inside of each bundle, in transverse                  section,    a conical
cap of .small celled tissue is to be seen.               This surrounds       the pro-
toxyleni, and extends up the flanks of the bundle                  till it  meets the
pericycle cells on either side (fig. 27).                 In   radial section      these
culls form four or five layers of elongated              cells to the inside of the
innermost protoxylem           elements     (fig.   29).    Higher    up, masses of
small cells are also found investing the foliar traces, but                    the cap
is composed of fewer cells, and            has not the same conical form                as
in the    case    of the cotyledon traces.            Where the cotyledon            and
foliar bundles are nearly of the same size,              as sometimes      happens at
the level represented       in fig. 12, it is always possible         to distinguish
between     them by means of this comparison.
    When the cotyledon traces           go off to the petioles, they        take with
them their investments of small cells, consisting of the inner                       caps
and their segments         of pericycle (i.e., peridesm          of Van     Ticghem)
and corresponding arc of endodermis.

separated by narrow rays five or six cells broad (fig. 30).                          Those
which will go off to the first pair of leaves are the oldest and most
fully   developed,     wbile those passing downwards from the youngest
leaves are only represented          by a mass of procambial tissue, which
will   become      phloem, the      xylem vessels          being indistinguishable
so   far from      the   node   at  which     the     development of the traces
in question       begins.      The    bundles      are    often   so    close    together
that     the   arcs   of   pericyclic    fibres    belonging      to    each    coalesce,
forming      an almost      continuous ring of fibres, only broken where
 there is    a  wider gap between           two adjacent bundles.             The most
 fully  developed      bundles have an arc of fibres three or four layers
 thick lying     outside their phloem, while for the most                 part    a  single
 layer only is found outside the younger bundles.                       The fibres aro
 never found except in connection with the phloem.                        If the bundle
 is so young      as to have     no xylem distinguishable, and only small
 cells to represent       the future     phloem, to the outside of this rudi
 mentary bundle, fibres, or cells already having the form of fibres,
 though      unthickened,      will  be    found    ;  but in the gaps           between
 bundles an inner layer of cortex, which can often bo distinguished
  as a starch sheath,      bends down a little, and comes to lie on paren
  chymatous pericycle cells.          But the distinction between the cortex
  and pericycle, when the latter is parenchymatous, cannot always                        be
  made.
     A  further result of the close juxtaposition              of the bundles is to
 bring    the   small cells which        cover     their Hanks       into contact,        so
  that wo get rays of small celled tissue formed (in the outer parts
  of which the interfascicular cambium arises), and even sometimes
  a continuous perimedullary zone, the pith being,                 as  it were, pushed
  back by the closing up of the bundles (fig. 30).                      (At a a small
  celled ray is partially formed,            a   large pith      cell    occupying the
  position midway between           the protoxylems, owing to the sloping
  away of the        small celled     tissue    on    the   flanks of the adjacent
  bundles.)
     These relations illustrate          (1)   the    primary importance of the
  bundle as an anatomical unit in the stem of typical angiospenns,
   — an importance which has, of course, been recognised ever since
  modern     plant anatomy had an existence,                 but has perhaps           been

small cells above described (the "interfascicular                                   pericycle       ").     This
disposition         is   common      enough in hypocotyls, where the bundles                                 are
widely separated.                 The individuality               of the bundle             as   a   unit      of

parenchymatous                pericycle of the root                is    still present        at the        base
of the hypocotyl, but soon loses its continuity across the phloem                                             as
we      pass upwards,             and      is   interrupted          by the          masses of            fibres

seen in the embryo                 and very young seedling.                          About         the    same
level    the cells           of the endodermis                lose their characteristic thicken
ings and are sometimes                      only distinguishable                from the            adjacent
cortex by the possession                   of starch —        a   character     which         is   itself    lost
later on.           The object of the starch in the endodermis                                is   obviously
to supply the pericyclic                    fibres    with material for thickening                          their
walls, and in the portions between                              the bundles to feed the inter
fascicular cambium.                 As      these two processes                proceed       it    gradually
disappears.              The interfascicular pericycle itself                  is    simply the           birth
place of the interfascicular                    cambium,          the cortex dipping between
the     bundles just far enough                     to bring       the pericycle opposite                    the
bands        of small celled            tissue between             the xylem and phloem                       in
which the fascicular cambium                          arises.       Thus we may almost                       say
that the stele of the root                     is   preserved       in the hypocotyl only                     as
a   matter         of convenience          ;    the      bundle         is    the    important            unit.

This view      is strengthened by a consideration and comparison                          of
the vascular arrangements               of (1) the root, (2) the hypocotyl, (3)
the epicotyl of the present plant.                In the root the cylinder or stele
is the natural form in which to describe                     the condensed       vascular
structure.        The compact         arrangement         is required to withstand
pulling strains      ; and since        the root, unlike the stem, directly per
forms an ultimate nutritive function (that of absorption), and does
not bear organs of unlike morphological nature, its vascular
structure is also,       so   to speak,        ultimate, and      is not made up of
units belonging to another morphological category,                         as is the case
in   the stem.
     In   the  young hypocotyl            there    are   distinct,    widely separated
cotyledon traces, and           it  is only the presence          of two single layers
of cells — the interfascicular pericycle and the endodermis — which
 allows of the term stele being applied to the vascular arrangement
here at all     ;  these two layers are present              in response       to definite
 demands      on the part of the plant ;               the interfascicular       pericycle
has to give rise to cambium,                and the endodermis           provides   starch
to be used up in its development and                   subsequent      activity  ; also in
                              '
 the thickening of the           bast fibres.'
     In   the epicotyl, the stele has even less individuality                 of its own.
It    is the result of close lateral approximation                     of separate      leaf
traces,     each    with   its own cap            of bast fibres    ;   and    the   slight
approach to a perimedullary                 zone    which is found is due to the
contact of the         small       celled    external      conjunctive     tissue   which
surrounds the xylem portion of each single bundle.
     In this   region    the leaf is the important             thing (since the only
function of the stem is to bear leaf structures),                  and the stele arises
as a secondary         phenomenon brought about by the association in
the most obvious way of the important units the loaf traces, and
it  is the structure and course of these which provide the principal
facts of vascular morphology.
     The fact that the cylinder             so  formed is continuous with that of
the root justifies, however, the use of the term                     stele as   applied to
the vascular cylinder of the axis              as a whole.
     There seems good reason to suppose that in tho flowering plants,
 at    least, the    formation        of a stele      is   generally determined by
mechanical considerations.

CTO                    Proceedings of Royal Society                             of Edinburgh.                         [?s.
     It     occurs        in    the root as a well-defined cylindrical                                  axial strand,
apparently              for the purpose of resisting pulling                                       strains.      In    tie
stem        it   is required for support and the resistance to bending strains,
and        hence        the formation of fibrous pericycle and sometimes                                               the
sclerization of the rays and perimedullary                                              zone   ;   when this        takes
place we have the stele at its highest point of development.
      On the other hand, the primary function of the vascular                                                    system
is conduction, and this is carried on by the leaf traces whether                                                            a
stele is present or not.
  In conclusion, I wish to express my extreme indebtedness to
Mr A. G. Tansley for the valuable advice and assistance he his
given me in the preparation of this paper.

Changes that occur in some Cells                    of the Newt's Stomach
      during Digestion.              By E. Wace Carlier, M.D., B.Sc,
      etc.,  Professor of Physiology, Mason University College, Bir
      mingham.         (With Five Plates.)
                               (Read   1st May 1899.)
    "With a view to ascertain         as  far  as possible  the minute changes
that occur in the cells of the mucous                membrane    of the stomach
during, and after, activity,        I  procured from England          towards the
end of winter       a   number of newts (Triton cristatus).
    When they arrived they were very emaciated, and, indeed,                       in
a starved condition, having no doubt but recently awakened from
their winter sleep       ;  they appeared,       however, quite healthy, and
swam well when placed              in water,      and  took and retained food
when given to them in the form of lively worms.
    These English newts were fed at the same time with the same
weight of worm, and killed at intervals after the meal, one being
sacrificed every twenty-four hours, to the end of the tenth day.
    Such long intervals were allowed to elapse between each sample
taken, because Langley (13) states that during winter in thin and
emaciated animals that have been fasting for a considerable                     time
the changes     take     place   very slowly.
    These   constituted the first set of experiments.
    In June of      the same year        I  procured    a large  number of fine
Triton eristatm from            the   Eft Pond in        the   Braid    Hills   near
Edinburgh.       They      were in good condition        and very lively.
    When worms        were given them, they ate them readily, and were
hungry again     in  less than twenty hours.        However, to make sure that
the stomach was quite empty and in               a resting condition,     I allowed
an interval of one hundred            and fourteen hours to elapse after the
first feeding, and then, selecting newts of about the same size and
weight, fed them a second time, each receiving the same amount
of healthy worm.           From   the first snap to the disappearance         of the
worm finally within the mouth              a  period varying from five to ten
minutes elapsed and was carefully noted in each                 case,   time being

674               Proceedings           of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                         [as.
counted          subsequently from the moment of disappearance                                of    &
worm.
      Of    these newts one was                killed   every half-hour for the first               in
hours, and subsequently at intervals of an hour.                                   In this   way, s-
far    as       was    possible,      every variant           except       time was eliminiWl
though not with complete success, for in                           a    few cases it was ai«:
wards found that some parasitic disease of the mucous                                    membraM
of the stomach                was   present,     and    those     so    affected     were    remoTcl
from the series.
   Method of Preparation.- — At the prescribed time each newt wis
pithed, opened, its stomach, duodenum,   and gullet removed wi;i-
out injury, and               placed upon a piece of thin paper.                       The    viscera
were then             opened     by     a   longitudinal      incision through their           entire
length      ;    their contents,            if any,   removed,         and the organs slightly
spread out flat without stretching upon the paper,                             with    the mucous
surface         uppermost.
      They were           then immersed,              paper      and    all, in Mann's         pie.ro-
        fixing solution (modified formula, sp. gr. 1020), in which
corrosive
they remained till next day, when saturated corrosive sublimate
(Heidenhain's formula) was substituted for it. At the end of
another twenty-four hours this was removed, and the tissue taken
up the          alcohol series into chloroform, and finally                          embedded in
paraffin (58' C, Griibler).  Longitudinal sections were then cut
in series with the Cambridge rocking microtome set to four teeth,
and fixed upon albuminised slides after spreading on warm water.
   To ensure equality in staining, and, therefore,                            comparability,            one
newt was used             as a test         object and all the slides stained up                   to    it;
the most          efficient way of doing this               is   to place     one section      of       the
te.4   newt upon each slide, and to                        see   that in all cases that             par
ticular section          is   stained       to exactly the same tint.           This    test section
may be placed at one end of the slide and                               subsequently wiped              off
before the other sections are finally covered.
   The sections were stained                    by immersion in various dyes,                 prefer
ence being given to Mann's (10) methyl-blue                                 eosine    long method,
and    M. Heidenhain's                (7) iron alum, hematoxylin,                  both long        and
subtractive methods.
  The photographs were                        all taken with           a   magnification      of    600
diameters.

1898-99.]      Prof. Carlier on Changes in Newt's Stomach.                    675
   The     cells   in  three regions     of   the   stomach    were   examined,
namely —  :
          1.  The glands of the oesophageal end.
          2.  The glands of the pyloric end.
          3.  The glands of the narrow zone between           1  and  2.
   The shape and arrangement of the cells in these different glands
have been        sufficiently    described    by Langley     and others,      and
require no repetition here.
    In  the present communication         I shall confine my remarks chiefly
to the cells of the oxyntic glands, and when colour is mentioned,
it refers to specimens       stained with methyl-blue eosine.
              Results of Experiments of No.               1  Series.

                                                                                —
The oxyntic cells are large, but do not occlude the lumen ; they
contain     numerous      zymogen     granules,   that stain of    a  vivid    red
colour, and vary in size from 2-8 fi to 1 ft in diameter, the majority
measuring from 1*8 /* to 2 ji.               Their great affinity for eosine
points to their albuminous nature.             The granules are not crowded
together, there being plenty of room for more.                 Each granule is
lodged in a tiny compartment in the                 pale blue protoplasm ap
parently containing fluid, as maintained for those of the lachrymal
and other glands by A. Nicolas (20). It is quite impossible to

with many gland           cells.   The nuclei are large,      10-6     x 12-8    /j,,
rather poor in chromatin and angular in outline, as described                    by
Langley      (13).    The nuclear juice is coagulated         by the action of
the    corrosive     sublimate,   and precipitated in the form of small
granules of equal         size,  named    cedematine by E. Reinke         (22)   or
hmthnnin by M. Ileidenhain (7).              These granules are not crowded
together, and stain of a pale sky-blue colour, i.e. they are cyano-
phile (Krasser, 11).
   The nucleoli are multiple, are not surrounded by              a ring of chro
matin, and vary in size from minute dots not larger than lanthanin
granules to bodies          measuring    2-7xl '8    p.   In   shape   some     are
rounded, others irregularly          oval; they acquire     a venous     red   tint

coloured plate, photo No. 2.) — The cells are small, in some ci=es
almost flattened, and the gland lumen is correspondingly large and
stellate.
   The zymogen granules have nearly disappeared                from the        pre t->
plasm,     those   remaining being of large size, 2-16          /x  in diameter,
with an average of        1"6 [i.   They are situated mostly near the             free
ends of the      cells, leaving the base and sides clear.         This    gives    rise
to the appearance       of two zones in the cells, the one basal,           contain
ing the nucleus,        and the other apical,        containing    the    granu!---.
Only    a  few cells, however, show this division into zones            ;   mo.-i    of
them     have   a  few granules scattered       throughout the       protonls.-m.
No zymogen granules are visible in the lumen, from which                       I con
clude    that the granules dissolve in           the   protoplasm     before tli*
secretion    leaves the cell, which      it does in a liquid   and unstainaK*
form, the protoplasm appears condensed              and   stains pale blue,       the
condensation      being due rather to the disappearance         of the     gTaniiVs
and discharge      of the fluid in the vacuoles       than the reconstruction
of the protoplasm.          In this I  agree rather with Nicolas (20) thin
with Langley (13).
    The nuclei are larger at this time than in the newt that «v

deeper     in, and that which is present is pale and has a            washed-out
appearance.
    The lanthanin       granules have in the majority of cases         undergone
no change, but in        a few nuclei they stain of a deeper tint.               The
 nucleoli vary      a good    deal   in size, but are not numerous.             Thev

      At      this   stage the cells are much larger, and the gland lumen                           is
 correspondingly reducod in size.                            The zymogen granules                 art;
  numerous, though                 not     crowded      together ; they are usually of
  medium or small size, the larger ones being most numerous near
  the apices          of the cells, though in very many cells                  it   is impossible
  to locate granules of any particular size in any definite part.                              They
  average          1'2 /t in diameter.            The cell protoplasm hardly stains at
   all, or exhibits          a pale    reddish-grey tint, showing that it has taken
   up alkaline material from the blood.
        The nuclei         appear    extremely wrinkled, and contain very little

    together,       to    such    an extent        that it     is   difficult     to    distinguish
    other nuclear           structures.         They stain of       a deep,      dull grey-blue,
     and     impart by their number and deep coloration                         a  misty appear
     ance to the nuclei.              Their     reaction   is changing.        The nucleoli are
     frequently of immense                size, and may be seen passing               through the
     nuclear       wall, which closes behind them.                    When in          the nucleus
     they lie in a tiny vacuole              free from lanthanin granules.

chromatin, which is practically invisible, but to the multitude                      of
fine   deeply-staining      lanthanin    granules that completely fill            the
nuclous.      When    a  view of the chromatin is obtainable, it is sea
to be scanty, but of a deeper            blue colour than in the           previca;
 section.
    The average size of the nucleus is 10'57 x 1204 /i.                It is thers-
fora becoming larger, probably swelling up by absorption of
material    from the protoplasm,         and   this agrees well with the          dis
appearance      of the wrinkles       from    its surface,    so obvious in        the
foregoing preparation.           The    nucleoli are sometimes         large,     and
often situated near the margin of the nucleus, and                a few may still
be seen in process of ejection.
   Near the pyloric end the nuclei are rather lilac than blue in                tint,
owing to the lanthanin          granules   exhibiting an affinity for the acid
as  well  as  for the basic dye, which indicates that their nature                    is
becoming     modified.      Nucleolar expulsion is going on apace.

   The gland lumen is small ; the cells lining it are large and filled
with brightly-stained        zymogen     granules    that vary considerably          in
size, the larger ones being usually situated in the neighbourhood                    of
the nuclei.      The granules     average    1*6 to 1'4 /x   in  diameter.      The
cell-protoplasm, which is hardly visible owing to the multitude                      of
granules   it  contains,   stains of a pale blue colour of the same tint             as
in the fasting animal.
   The nuclei       are   plump-looking,      and    measure     on an     average
12"37 x    1 3*18        they are therefore        bigger than those of           the
previous section.        They also exceed in size those of the newt             that
had long fasted, and        are less angular.      Many of these nuclei         con
tain great     numbers of tiny lanthanin            granules that stain of            a
beautiful lilac     tint, but though very numerous               they no     longer
obscure   the    other elements.         They    are   in  a   similar but     more

streaks that       are more       or less united together by fine threads of
chromatin.          In other       cases, and     this applies     to  almost    every
nucleus      near    the    pyloric    end,   the lanthanin      granules are      less
numerous,       larger,     and stain of the same pale              sky-blue tint    as
 described in the case of the fasting animal.                 The chromatin is still
 more abundant in          these nuclei, and stains deep blue.           The nucleoli
 are   large and often numerous,            but their extrusion appears to have
 ceased.
     The    cells   seem      now to     have    entirely    recovered    from    their
  exertions, and are ready again,            as soon    as  called upon, to recom
 mence secreting.           The newts themselves           exhibited every sign of
 hunger, hunting about the vessels in which they were kept for
 food, which they seized and devoured the moment it was presented
  to them.
      A  further proof that the cells are now resting is that mitosis
  begins to appear frequently in them.                (Photo 8.)      Many beautiful
  mitotic figures in all stages are present in the oxyntic cells of this
  preparation, showing that Stintzing                (25) was in error when he
  asserted    that oxyntic cells never divide by mitosis.                Cell-division
  goes on somewhat slowly in these animals,                 and continues to mani
 fest itself, even though no food be given, to the tenth day, though
  with   less and less energy.

tremities.     The cytoplasm is of           a  very pale grey, or even colour
less, perhaps     tinted with        pink.     The nuclei are much wrinkled,
measuring 9-2 x 1082          /u., and contain very little chromatin, which
is stained of a decided        red tint, rendering it difficult to distinguish
from the      nucleoli.      The      lanthanin     granules    are very pale and
almost invisible.        Some      nucleoli are being extruded, and mitosis
appears    arrested.
   Four    hours   after food. — The lumen is large and the cells very
small, with only a few granules of zymogen in them.                       The proto
plasm     often appears      condensed,        but hardly stains       at all.   The
nuclei, which are very irregular, measure               8'8 x 1T8       and contain
but very little chromatin, which                seems   concentrated.       Nucleoli
are not numerous,         but some are still apparently being extruded,
and mitosis was not observed.
   Five hours after food. — (Fig. 8, coloured plate.) — The lumen is
now somewhat smaller owing to increase in the size of the cells,
 which contain more zymogen granules of medium or small size that
 do not stain at all      vividly.      The protoplasm is pale blue, and the
nuclei are less wrinkled and somewhat dusky in appearance, owing
 to increase    in the number of lanthanin               granules.     These   are of
 small size and stain       deeply blue.          Extrusion    of nucleoli appears
to have ceased, as has also cell division.

zymogen granules       ;   the cytoplasm stains pale            blue.    The nuclei
are   less   angular,    stain     deeply,     and   have    increased    in size  to
 1T44 x 14-55 p.        Chromatin        is more    abundant in them, and the
karyosomes      show a tendency to unite together; they stain deep
blue.     Lanthanin     granules are abundant, small in size, but do not
produce clouding of the nucleus; they stain of                    a deep slate-blue
colour, with a decided          lilac tint.      The nucleoli are not numerous,
are usually of small size, and surrounded by a clear space free from
lanthanin granules.         Xo     cells are dividing.

                                     — (Fig.  11, coloured plate.) — The lunK-n
is now very small owing to the                cells  almost filling it up.          TLej
are   crowded with            medium-sized zymogen          granules,   a few      being
larger.       The cytoplasm stains pale blue, and appears only as                  a fine
network between the granules.                  The nuclei, however, have again
diminished somewhat in size to 10 x 12"57 ft, which is almost                          the
size they were          to begin with.       Their chromatin is abundant              and
blue in colour, and the lanthanin              granules large and of      a  pale blue
tint.      Many cells      are in process of mitotic division.
   Wo       may     now say that the colls have completed               the   cycle      of
their changes         due to secretion.       They appear to secrete for abont
three     to four hours,        and then to require about the same time                 to
recuperate      ;  but the worm is still in the stomach at this period, and
not completely digested.
    Thirtrrn       hours   after food. — Lumen very wide and eel's niuc.'i

walls   ;   they contain only       a  few scattered zymogen granules         situate;!
mostly near the free ends of the cells.                    The cytoplasm is        pale
blue-grey      and in small amount.           The nuclei have       a shrivelled   ar.>l
pale appearance,          measuring      only 8T    x 10'2   ji.   Their    chromatin
has   a    pale spread-out look and watery-blue tint.                 The lanthanin
granules       are very scanty and of a pale blue colour.               The nucleoli
are small as a rule, and some are in process of extrusion.                     Mitosis
is quite absent.
   Therefore, after recovering from their first exhaustion, the                    cells
again     commenced         to secrete, and have now again reached             a stage
bordering on complete exhaustion.

no     mitosis   present.
      Seventeen hours after food. — The lumen is now small, and the
•cells are filled with large zymogen granules, those near the free
extremities        of the cells being somewhat smaller than the others.
The       cytoplasm is pale grey.               The    nuclei are large and         deeply
 stained;      they measure        1 1 "82   x 14"8S /i, and    contain chromatin of
 si deep blue        colour.     Lauthanin        granules are abundant and stain
 deep     blue, with     a decided       lilac tint.    Nucleoli are ofieu large, and
  some    are being extruded.
      By   the nineteenth or firentit-th         hour the cells have again come to
  rest, and some mitotic figures make their appearance in them.
      The cells lining the surface of the stomach, and those of the
  pyloric glands and necks of the oxyntic glands, have also been
  cirefully    studied.      Although their secretion is of          a  different nature
  from that of the oxyntic cells, they exhibit during activity and
   repair precisely the same nuclear changes as the oxyntic cells.
   Therefore, without wearying you with further details, I                      may piss
   at once to the conclusions          I   have drawn from this investigation.
                              Ri'srMK and Conclusions.
      As   soon   as  the    food   is swallowed        secretion   commences       in tie'
   oxyntic glands of        tin- stomach,       and sweeps in      a  slow wave along
   the whole      organ,    commencing at            the   (esophageal     opening     and
   passing off   at the pyloric end at such a rate that the cells near the
   pyloric extremity       reach     their maximum activity some one and                  a
   half  to two hours after those              near the oesophagus.
      For any one cell, the wave reaches its maximum between the
   third and fourth hour or hour and a half, and is followed by a
   period of rest and recuperation, which lasts for another four or live
   hours; after which, if food is still present in the stomach, the
   cells again enter upon         a   second secretory       period   that follows     the
   same course as the first.
      According     to Langley, and           Langley    and   Sewall (13), the cells
   continue to secrete actively during the period of repair,                  statements
    which   they base mainly         on their experimental          researches     on the

         Of still more interest                                                 is,I        think, the fact that when the                         cell    is
nearly exhausted                                          the          affinity of the chromatin for the blue                                          dye

diminishes, while its affinity for the acid eosine increases to such an
extent    that the spread-out         karyosomes      tend to stain   rather red
than blue.       This   can only be due to alteration occurring              in   the
constituents of the karyosomes.              This  red stage does not, however,
last long, the blue reaction coming quickly back again soon after
repair has set in.       It   is interesting to note in this respect       that the
chromatin of the head of the spermatozoon               shows the same affinity
for  acid dyes, though chemically rich in nucleic acid.
    Of no less interest in connection with this, is the growth and
extrusion of nucleoli during the period of nuclear activity, which
goes   on for some time          also during     the process   of repair,    getting
less  and    less   as  the     nucleus   is    nearing the resting condition.
By their reaction       the nucleoli are albuminous bodies.              I   believe
this extrusion of nucleoli to be          a  constant phenomenon of nuclear
activity,   as  I  have    observed     it in many different kinds of          cells.
Henneguy (9) has also seen chromatic granules extruded through
the nuclear wall, which he believes to be elastic, as it closes up
again immediately after their passage.                Further,   A. Michel (17)
has stated      recently that nucleoli consist          of two parts,       a main
substance     and    an   accessory     substance.     More recently still,        A.
Pizon (21) from his       studies on Ascidia       (M. socialis  and M.    simplex)
concludes    that the nucleolus during the whole ripening of the ovum
throws off big spherical masses of effete substance               that leave the
nucleus    by passing     through its wall, and passing         into the vitelhis
are moved through         it   to its periphery in a peculiar manner;            i.e.,
the nucleolus, in part at least, is effete material.
   I  believe    that in this animal the nucleoli consist             entirely of
effete material,   which is produced during nuclear activity           ;   that the
nucleus is capable of tolerating this material in certain amount, but
that when it becomes excessive, it is passed out into the protoplasm,
where it disappears.        It  certainly does not become converted directly
into zymogen      granules,     as some   would have us believe.
   I  have    shown elsewhere        (4) that the nucleolus of the mamma
lian ovum Bhould also be considered as mainly composed of effete
material.
   I cannot agree with Balbiani (1), who considers              the nucleolus to
be a sort of cell-heart, or with those who            believe  that chromatin is
manufactured in it [Flemming               (6),  Malaquin (15), etc.], or even

 68G               Proceedings of Royal Society           of Edinburgh.               [*¦¦.
 with those who maintain that chromatin elaborated                         elsewhere       -•
stored      up in the nucleolus [Sabotta (23), Labbe (12), Mingazaa:
 (18),    etc.]. I therefore agree with Pizon (21), and those oik:
 observers       who hold that the nucleolus is entirely, or at                  least
great part, composed of effete material.
     The changes occurring in the nucleo-hyaloplasm are also ink-re-t-
ing.      When precipitated with mercuric chloride, during the                     rest:nc
condition, the precipitate lanthanin of M. Heidenhain (7)                           stains
pale blue.          As activity   proceeds,     these granules become more acl
more      scanty, but just after the nucleus reaches its maximum                          of
shrinkage, the lanthanin            becomes       very abundant, and stains of              3
deep blue colour, which gradually gives place                     to a beautiful       Kv:
tint    as  repair goes on, finally returning to pale blue when repiir                    i>
complete.          This  denotes that the nuclear juice undergoes             chernk.i]
change       during nuclear activity.           Strasburger ('26) in 1892 stated
that the         reaction   of nuclei     depended       upon their condition o:
nutrition      ;  well   nourished nuclei being erythrophile,              and    ixjorly
nourished ones cyanophile.               This     corresponds    well with what        has
j u>t   been stated.
    The      great    fatigue   exhibited      by the nuclei of secreting            col's
 (lining the conversion of zymogen               into zymin by the action of         very
 dilute acids has for       a long time     been a puzzle to me, for one would
 suppose the manufacture of zymogen                 would be far more exhausting
 than its more passage out of the cell into the gland lumen.
     The researches of MacCallum           ( 1 4)  of Toront o  throw light upon this
 sul iject.     He maintains that zymogen is preceded by a substance rich
 in phosphorus and iron produced at the expense of the chromatin of
 the nucleus.         This  substance   he terms prozymogen, which becomes
 united with        a constituent of the cell protoplasm to form             zymogen.
 Mouret (19) also takes a similar view of the production of zymogen,
 and lie named the antecedent substance                        "                      ami
                                                                   prezyruogen,"
 lienslcy (3) has corroborated these researches                  in his recent     pap--r
 on the stomach.
     I   believe     that the nuclear exhaustion so evident in my                  speci
 mens is indeed brought about             by the manufacture of prozymogen.
     Almost       directly  after the cell had begun          to pour out its      secre
 tion,     the   nucleus    commences       to form      a  new supply of piwv-
mogen        at   the expense    of   its store      of chromatin,       and that     the

movement of the chromatin towards the nuclear membrane                               and
its application to its inner surface is of service                    in    facilitating
this process      ;  but   I   further believe    that the      prozymogen        is not
elaborated       into zymogen        until  the cells    have    practically emptied
themselves       of the zymogen         already produced,        and have begun to
take up substances           from the blood.       Once this has occurred,            the
cell quickly transforms the prozymogen                  into new zymogen, which
is the meaning of the rapid reappearance                 of the zymogen granules.
    On the other hand, the power of the nucleus to manufacture
prozymogen         is limited, and once its store of chromatin is reduced
to a certain point, it must renew the stock before it can again pro
 duce    prozymogen,       and    that this renewal of chromatin is brought
about by the entrance into the nuclear juice of an easily coagulable
 substance      (probably a proteid material              amongst      other     things),
 which     is   the    meaning of the         great    increase    in the lanthanin
 granules soon          after    complete     exhaustion      of   the    nucleus     has
occurred,     and     I  believe    that this necessity      for repair sufficiently
 accounts     for the phenomenon of the double                  secretory     wave, the
 cell, though full of zymogen              granules,    not being in      a  fit state to
 secrete again       until  the nucleus    is completely recuperated          ; but that
 when once this point is reached, there being no longer any further
 need of rest, the cell again starts secreting             should any call      be made
 upon its energies.
     I have,   therefore,     been able to supply the        link in   the chain that
 seems to have been missing in the work of previous                      investigators,
 namely, the observation above recorded of an absolute diminution of
 chromatin occurring           as a result of the production of prozymogen.
     Chromatin contains nucleic acid and             an  albuminous substance         ; it
 is very stable, and acts as an acid: to bodies less acid than itself                     ;
 therefore it stains          with methyl-blue.        In order that this          stable
 body may         pass into the cytoplasm          it must     be rendered soluble
 (there being no evidence of its passage bodily out of the nucleus) ;
in this process some of the albumin is removed as effete material
 that   goes  to form the nucleolus.           This albumin       acts as      a base in
 presence     of bodies       more    acid than itself, and therefore            exhibits
 marked affinity for the eosine.             Being now useless in the nucleus
 it is extruded into the protoplasm, there                to be disposed of.          The
 more acid part of the chromatin passes into the cytoplasm,                      where  it

remains in an invisible state, unless the phosphorus and iron              it con
tains are unmasked and revealed by dyes            as directed by MacCallum.
   When the cell begins to take up material from the blood (serum
albumin, etc.) this prozymogen quickly links on some albumin
to become zymogen      in the form of granules, nucleo-albuminous                 in
nature, which is probably a still less stable compound than                     the
prozymogen     ; it now reacts    as a feeble    base to eosine, and hence is
stained red with that dye.          It is also readily soluble when brought
into contact with    a weak acid, either in the cytoplasm or elsewhere.
In other words, both chromatin and                 zymogen    have    the    same
nuclein radicle, their difference        in staining property and solubility
depending on the amount of albumin linked on to it.

When this material          is all disposed     of, the nuclear juice, when pre

nuclear juice to find the             earliest   indication of the synthesis by
which chromatin is built up from simpler compounds.
   Another      interesting point is the fact that              so long as the nuclei
are in an exhausted condition, no mitosis occurs, but                      that as   soon
as  repair has reached         a  certain stage       a  few nuclei exhibit mito:::
figures,   which      increase     steadily in number            until   the cells     are
fully   restored,     when its maximum is reached, to again diminish
and cease altogether when the nuclei again become exhausted.
    Further, cells called upon to secrete during nuclear division do                     so
exactly    as if  no mitosis were going on, and this secretion proceed?
along with the division, both occurring at the same time, the chro
matin of the mitotic figure showing exactly the same changes in
appearance and colour reactions exhibited by the karyosomes of

that, owing        to   the    disappearance       of   the    nuclear envelope         no
 nucleoli are formed,         the split-off     albuminous       material being        dis
 posed of directly by the cytoplasm.

 On     Some         Remains of Scottish Early Post-Pliocene
      Mammals. By the Rev. Professor Duns. Xo. II.
                                 (Read May 15, 1899.)
     At the meeting of the Society on the 20th February                       1893    1 had
 the honour of reading a paper                 " On    the   Early History of some
 Scottish Mammals and Birds." Perhaps the title both of that
                                                     " Eemarks on the Literature
 paper and of the present should be
 associated     with some Early Post-Pliocene                 Mammals."
     The science of      a Species      means    much more         than the naming of
 its several parts by       Latin   and Greek derivatives.             Even as regards
 these parts, one would like to know something of extinct                        forms at
 the time when they had              a   place   among     the living,    just  as, when
 dealing with        recent   forms, we        find much to shed           light on      the
 structure,    probable habits, and surroundings, especially of mammals
 which became extinct in quaternary time.                        Questions arise that
 are worth noting, were it for nothing more than to make it clear
 that the mere obiter dicta even of able and wide-minded experts
 may often be misleading.              The tendency which prevails to deter
 mine   species     by characteristic bone-marks can never be perfectly
satisfactory,      because     there      are   many     instances in which           close
structural      resemblance      is    associated     with     great   dissimilarity      of
habit.      It  is not    so  easy    as    some seem       to  think   to   distinguish
 between     several of the long bones of the wolf with the correspond
ing bones of the collie, or between those of the sheep and of                           the
goat.    Then,      as  to footprints       on stiff, tenacious      quaternary     clays,
is there     any risk of       a   label? — "marks of            the  feet   of  a smali

literature, sometimes       as  being in the university and sometimes               as
in   the National Museum.
     The subjects     now referred to are of some interest both to the
naturalist      and   the  antiquary, especially        when dealt       with    from
 wider than mere zoological points of view.                Much of the informa
 tion we have at present of recently extinct forms consists of details
of    structure   couched    in  a   terminology which only experts readily
 appreciate.       No doubt, progress in palaeo-zoology would be impos
 sible without such        details,   but it would be greatly helped were
they associated        with other than        specific  features   — with, for     ex
ample,     what might suggest habits and habitats, physical and vital
surroundings,       gradational relations,        geographical       and   geological
distribution.       Extinct   animals might thus come to have a place in
 recent history.       Thus regarded, the following questions of general
interest are raised : — Do the remains of extinct forms, looked at in
 the light of their environments,           point to local climatal changes, or
to alterations of surface         in the areas in which they occur, or to
links    dropped    out of gradational rank, or to the realisation of new
 conditions of life by the disappearance             of an old or by the intro
duction of      a new species?      And suppose we assume the ever-present
 influence    in species of an innate, ever-active          element    of structural
variation,      in what direction does it work            1    Is it towards      new
 species, or is it only towards increase of variation in species            ?  These
 questions     are put in the belief that we have materials to warrant
 them.      In Scottish literature,     reaching back      three or four hundred
years, we have references           to mammals        and birds now extinct by
 men who manifestly        had cultivated the habit of the eye — men who
 saw the forms       around    them    and    who could       describe   what they
 saw.
     In  the literature to which         I  refer we have information (1) on
 the physical and vital environments of mammals and birds ; (2) on
 the physical features of the districts in which they had been, or                  in
 which they were, at the time of the observer's                first record ;  (3) on
climatal conditions; (4) on the prevalent fauna and flora of their
time; (5) occasionally, on the nature of superficial deposits ; (6) on
important phenomena connected with migration ; (7) on the limits,
if  not on the laws of variation        ;  and (8) on outstanding facts in the
ancestral history of several extinct forms.              That the men to whom

them in greater relief.                  Many examples might              be given    of the       deep
indebtedness of present students of science to these literary                                record;
of the far past.                 Some      of the sources            of the information we           are
in quest of may be named.                             Leaving        out of view what may             be
called the literature of the chartularies, we have Adamnan's                                       Vita

much light is shed on the mammals                            of those times by giving promi
nence to their environments, physical                           and vital.       These sources of
information were referred to in my last paper, and instances illus
trative of their value were quoted.                           They    deserve to be made more
of than they are by recent writers, were                             it for no other      end th^n
making them             a    part of common culture.                     The power to utilise
them would itself imply scientific attainments, because such records
of the remote           past       owe      much of their value to the fact that they
shed reflex light on man's social, industrial,                          and often even artistic
condition at the time                ;   in a word, on stages of civilisation,— the
outcome of men               in touch with and able to control their environ
ments.
    In    the    geology         of the surface — in superficial strata — we have
another source              of    information          regarding the natural             history of
pre-historic        and early              historic       species.      Here,     however,      very
much depends             on the qualifications of the student.                      If   a special
ist, say, in any one vertebrate                   family of organisms, his descriptive
identification          of       species     will be perfectly trustworthy in that
family of fishes or reptiles, birds or mammals.                              But    some     of    the
most important points touching                        it,   may, very often do, require more
than      a   general   knowledge of quaternary strata, whether the                            speei-
mens are geological or archaeological,                        or both in one.     The occurrence

industrial        implements,       or of rude        pre historic art, introduce              new
elements of observation              and inference.            The association of objects
 of    man's       handiwork with the remains                   of extinct         animals     goes
 far    to indicate     the nature      of the environments                 of the animals—
 so far, indeed,          as   to warrant         generalisations          in regard        to the
 physical conditions,           the fauna and             flora   in the midst of which
 both      the lower      animals      and      man      lived     and     moved.          Natural
 science may thus do for these extinct forms                            a service       analogous
 to what       the historian has done for the men of                         "  the long ago,"
 showing them          as influenced      by and influencing their surroundings.
      Now, subjects of importance               as to the       distribution and associa
 tions of        extinct forms        are suggested           here.       In     some parts       of
 Britain,       and,    more     widely,      over     the     Continent, traces of the
 presence        of man      alongside     of remains           of extinct mammals               are
  common, indeed,            so    common,        as    to warrant          the    inference       of
  contemporaneity.              But in Scotland, such                 cases      occur     without
  any     traces    of man.          Does     this imply          that in such           localities
 extinct       species had       looked     their last before             man appeared            on
  the scene?         Some argue        that this was           so.     But,      in reality, the
  question of         time    is   not   raised      here,      though       the     question      of
  population is.         Contemporary with the animals where                            man     met
  them, there were wide areas which the people                            had not occupied,
  and in these animals              had    lived undisturbed by man, yet they
  had disappeared.            I   don't attempt          to account        for the disappear
  ance, but can only theorise                touching the           setting      in of physical
  conditions fatal to animal life.                    The terms          pre-glacial,       glacial,
  post-glacial,      ultra-glacial,      and     inter-glacial come into mind                      at
  the bare mention of unfavourable                         physical conditions.              But    I
   wish to keep clear of these in this paper                         as   much       as   possible.
  This     does not mean, however,               that      we are to keep out of view
  the nature, order, and            relations     of the surface           deposits      in which
   the   remains      of extinct forms occur.                 On the contrary, it is of
   chief importance that we should try to collate                                the   superficial
   beds     of  one district       with those of another                 which geologically
   differs from them         but contains the same remains.                       This indicates
   the importance         of studying         these deposits         both      from the biotic

 and    the  stratigraphical      points of view.          It will    be evident      lx>;%
 the foregoing remarks that the object                  I  have in view under             th*
 title of the paper        is mainly       to indicate that       the    palafozookgis:
 should not limit himself to the determination                      of species by         the
use of a       terminology      which only practised specialists can fully
understand.          Xo doubt         the    terminology      is   necessary      for     the
 progress    of science, but if work in this department is to promote
general      culture    in   a   natural,      easy,   and    interesting      way,       ti^
characterization of extinct species will include the physical                            and
vital conditions of the localities in which they occur.                          Looking
at the trend of        present     speculative science touching the upward
march of species,        I  dare   say most of us whose             work lies in         thi>
or    in closelj' -related branches, have             heard friends whose train
ing in other branches qualify                 them to deal        with    the    rules      of
evidence,       regretting     that    they know          nothing     of   and     cannot
estimate the value         of the alleged        scientific facts held to warranl
certain sweeping biological generalizations.
     The mammal remains which               I  have   had   before     me both in this
and in my first paper           may be stated        thus : — Elephantid-E.            The
Mammoth (Elapluis primigmius,                    Blum.)      Cerviu.k.       1.  The      so-
culled    Greater Red-Deer (Cervus elaphi/s, L.).                    2. The Reindeer

2. The     Celtic  Shorthorn      or   Longfronted      Ox   (B. longifroiu<, Owen).
I had intended to place on the table examples of remains of                         eacb,
but at present       will limit my remarks            to the Mammoth Tusk, the
Great Red-Deer Antlers,             and     the skull     of the Celtic Shorthorn.
    I. The Mammoth.              Traces of this form have              been   met with
in Ayr, Berwick,        Edinburgh, Lanark, and Perth shires.                    I  notice
only the Mid-Lothian tusk.              Its history is soon told.         It was found
in 1820 on the Clifton Hall estate near Ratho, by labourers                             em
ployed in making the             Union      Canal, at a point        where the      earth
slopes and forms the valley through which the river Almond flows,
and was taken by the finders to a cottage near the works.                       The    find
was reported to      Sir Alexander Maitland,           the proprietor of the estate,
who, accompanied         by the engineer of the works, visited the cottar.
When       the   workmen       learned through          them     that the     tusk     wa;
ivory, they quietly sent two of their number with it to Edinburgh,

with instructions to sell it to an ivory-turner.                             This being reported
to    Sir Alexander,            he hastened to the city, where                      he found            it in
the       hands     of the ivory-turner, who had                        already sawn it across
in three places, and had prepared                         one of the parts for the lathe,
in    order       to form chessmen.                  Sir Alexander            repaid          the money
which had been given                    for    it,   and gave      it   a    place in Cliftonhall
as    a    very highly-prized              specimen.            There   is   abundant evidence
that the           naturalists       of the day were               greatly interested              in and
put   a    high value on the tusk.                   At Sir Alexander's                 death     it   passed
into possession of his son, John Maitland,                               Esq., late Accountant
of the Court of Session, and was given by him to me in 1864.
There        has     been    a      good     deal     of controversy              touching both            as
to the nature            of the deposit              and the depth           in   it     where     it     was
found.      I       think   it   can be       proved that         it    was not at            a   depth    of
from 15 to 20 feet, but only near the surface.                                           It    was never
placed       in the university or the National Museum,                                  as    Sir Charles
Lyell       and others have alleged.
     II.    The so-called Greater Red-Deer {Cervus elaphus, L.). This                                      is
the Strongylocerus        of Owen.   The antlers on the table are fine
examples           of the horns of this variety of red-deer.                                  They were
found at      a    little below the surface of
                   point    a                     dried-up pond near     a
Kingskettle, Fife. The term     " greater
                                          "
                                            ascribed to this form                                          is
warranted by the fact that many of its remains seem to indicate an
animal of larger growth than the present common red-deer.                                              They
occur deep down in peat bogs, marl beds, and in the sites of lochs
long dried up.              Deer-stalkers generally are of opinion that there                              is
a    slow but real declension               going on among stags.                  If   so, there must
be   a    cause.      Does   it     result from the ever-increasing                      narrowing of
the areas of range, or from the growing scarcity of favourite food,
or from the changeful                elements of civilisation, with its railways and
steamboats          bearing         in on their usual             haunts,     or from all these
things working together                    begetting,      as    Owen once alleged,                a    rest
lessness not favourable                to growth?
     The horns seem to have been torn off, not shed.                                         Their weight
is   23 lbs. 14 ozs.            Looking at them            as    right and left, the former                is
11 lbs. 10 ozs., the latter 12 lbs.                   4   ozs.     This discrepancy               between
the two appears also when they are measured, thus                                  :—

mains of this ox seem to indicate that   lived from early Post-  it

deposit-; as those           in which the bones of the uras are found.                               That
the urns preceded               the shorthorn, but had not died out when the
litter      was      introduced       to       Scotland, appears              likely.     There            an?
records of the occurrence                    of its remains      in most,       if   not in all,           the
counties of Scotland.             I      have       a   part of the skull of one which                    was
found in the brick clay near                        Dunbar, to my surprise in the                     same
layer       as   a   perfectly preserved                pretty little ophiuroid           (OfhioU^.if
o-a    ¦<'',.-¦),seldom       met with now in the same locality.                        The portion
of the skull of this ox on the table was presented                                 to   Xew      College
Museum, and was for                  a       time    believed to be Scottish, but                 it       was
afterwards found to have been got in County Limerick,                                            a    little
helow the surface of             a   peat moss, along with             a   bit of skin with                the
hair attached,           a   piece of coarse cloth, and               a   fragment of earthen
ware.          The horns are entire, but the bones have lost their mineral
constituents altogether.                  Arehaiologically, this specimen                 is     of much
interest.
     There are other forms which,                          in this connection, are                 -worth

many       instances  illustrative    of,   at least,  the general    drift of this
paper.        One of these occurs         in the description of an Ayrshire
Crannog by Dr Robert Munro,                 to whom we are all indebted for
many       able   and  wide-minded         contributions    to anthropology     and
archaeology.        The following zoological         and botanical remains    were
 found     in the   crannog :— (a) Zoology         :  Bos longifrom,    Sus srrofa

 to all   these, it was found that man had left marks of his presence!
 among       them.    There      were   implements of stone,         bone,   wood,
 bronze, and iron, which had all been in               use, and along   with these
 ornaments were met with which shed some light on the art of the
  time.     Now, were we to fix our attention on any one bone, say                a
  bone of the reindeer       {Ci rrus tnramlus, L.), after determining the
  species,   would there not      be much      to suggest   interesting questions
  touching     the  physiography of the district, its climatal conditions,
  the geographic d distribution of this species of deer, and even some
  thing worth knowing         as to man and his       ait at a  very early period?

       The Gunning Victoria Jubilee Prize for 1.^1)3-96                was presented

   the Physics of Meteorology.
       The Chairman,       on presenting the Prize, said       : —
       Mr John Aitken's          outstanding     contribution     to  science, is     his
   paper    "On      Dust,   Fogs,   and    Clouds,"   which     was    published      in
   the Society's Transactions (vol. xxx. pp. 3.'!7-3G8).                 Remarkable
   originality and ingenuity was shown in devising the apparatus which
   revealed and displayed the fact that the atmosphere                    everywhere
   contains small        particles  of dust,     which serve     as   nuclei    in   the
   condensation of the aqueous vapour of the air into cloud and rain.
   It  was shown at the same time that there are always present                  in the
   atmosphere great quantities of chloride of sodium and other kinds
   of dust, which, from their affinity for water, cause condensation
   to take,   place    in unsaturated air, thus producing dry fogs,               when
   they happen        to be    present   in  great  quantities.      But   as  regards
   those dust particles which have no affinities           with water, condensa
   tion is delayed till supersaturation begins,           and    wet   fogs are pro
   duced  ;   and   further,    when this stage has been reached,             there is
   a  tendency to inequality in the size of the cloud particles which
   determines     the fall of some of them through           the others, and       thus
   rain follows.
      The great      density of town fogs is occasioned            by the   fact that
   many    of the products of combustion have strong affinities with
   water, thus favouring the generation of dry fogs.

708            Proceedings of Royal Society             of Edinburgh.             [sbs.
     It is shown by       Mr Aitken'a dust-counters that            the numbers       cf
dust particles in the atmosphere           are subject to extreme variation —
the numbers varying from almost             nil at   the Ben Nevis Observatory
in certain types of weather to 100,000 in                  a   cubic inch.      Uude!
Mr Aitken's         direction the numbers of dust particles have                   been
for some      years     observed   regularly     at this Observatory,         and th-
importance of the results cannot             be   over-estimated       in their    bear
ings on the cyclones and anti-cyclones of North- Western                       EuroT>e.
This great discovery is leading the way in other important inquiries
in meteorology,         of which may be mentioned the formation of clea:
spaces in dusty air (Transactions,           vol.   xxxii.   p. 239) in connection
 with the sudden and frequent hygrometric changes                      in the   atmos
phere, as shown by continuously self-recording hygrometers.
     His    series    of   papers  in   the   Proceedings on          "Thermometer
 Screens"      is   a    valuable   contribution       to   practical    meteorology.
 Meteorologists are enabled by the methods                  proposed     to make     th>-
closest    approximation       yet possible to an observation of the true
 temperature      of the air.
     Another     very suggestive      paper    is the     "Note     on Hoar     Frost"
 (Procmxlings,      vol. xiv. p. 121), in which         such extraordinary accre
 tions of ice    as  occur so frequently at the Ben Nevis Observatory                 on
 the windward side of posts and other objects                 exposed     in the wind
 during certain types of weather are explained.

      The Chairman close          1   the Session       with the following remarks                 :   —
      In    the Review of the          Session    which    I   have been called upon to
  give,    I   shall conline my survey to statistics and                          a      few general
  remarks.
  I        find that during the Session           now brought to              a   close, 6" papers
  were read.         Of   these    16 belonged          to the department of Physics,
  C   to that   of Mathematics,           1   to Astronomy,              6   to Chemistry,         2    to

ology, 10 to Zoology,        1 to Botany, 9 to Physiology,      1  to Anatomy,
1  to   Philology, and    1  to Archaeology.
    The President has favoured us with papers on Cosmic Physic?
and     Electrodynamics,       while the Physical      and Chemical      T^al>ori-
tories of the Universities of Edinburgh          and Glasgow have furnished
important contributions to our publications, nor have the Physio
logical Laboratories        of these Universities     been less     assiduous in
giving us communications of great interest and value.                  A   distin
guished     Fellow of    the Society at the Cape          of Good Hope         still
contributes papers on the Higher Algebra.               The proximity of tie
Firth of Forth        has led    to communications on the structure            ar.d
physiology of the organisms found within its waters;                  whilst    tli'1
able    officials of the Geological Survey of Scotland have kept                    a
successful    outlook for the traces of extinct organisms         impressed      on
the rocks which        come under        their notice in the course      of their
operations,     and  have    handed the fossils, thus found, for classitici-
tiou to an expert,       who has described them to           the Society.       Sir
.Ioiiv Murray favoured          us with an Address on the Structure            and
Origin of Coral Islands, while his example has led other naturalist
to give papers      on Antarctic     Zoology and Atlantic Deposits.            The
Astronomer-Royal        for Scotland illustrated, from personal          observa
tions, the grand phenomena          of the Eclipse of the sun of 22nd January
last  ;  nor must   I  omit to mention that we have had a paper part!y
scientific and partly literary on the Crab in relation to Cancer                  in
 Mythology;       and   Professor      Cbum    Brown,    whose    versatility    we
often have had occasion         to admire,    gave us a literary paper on the
origin of some of the characters of the Phoenician Alphabet.
    1 Hiring the Session we have added to our number twenty-four
 Ordinary Fellows.        Of these — two are Principals of Colleges, one
 a Professor, five are University         Lecturers, and three are Doctors        of
 Medicine.
    "Whilst welcoming the additions to our ranks, we have                   at the
 same time to lament the loss of ten Fellows who have been taken
 from us by death.        These include —
    Mr Jamks Stjib, who for many years discharged               the responsible
 duties   of the orlice     of   General     Manager    of the   British    Linen
Company's Bank.

     Professor Calderwood, who              was somewhat unexpectedly elected
to the Chair of Moral Philosophy in our University, but discharged
its duties with         great  efficiency   and success     ;  and has written      and
 edited    several    important works on mental science.
     Professor IlEnDi.E, who contributed               to our Transactions         eight
 elaborate     papers      on   the Mineralogy        of    Scotland   ;   and    whose
 extensive collection of Minerals,           to the   formation of which he had
 devoted      the    labour    of   a  lifetime, now       constitutes one       of the
 treasures of the Edinburgh            Museum of Science and Art.
      Robert Wilson, who            possessed great      mathematical ability, and
  contributed      a paper     to the     Proceeding* of this        Society on      the
  Contact     of    Surfaces,     in which      he   employed the        resources     of
  geometry in the elucidation of that difficult subject.
      The Hon.         Bouvkrii':     Primrose,      who     for   many years        was
  Secretary to the Board of Manufactures, and evinced the interest
  he took in the prosperity           of this Society, by bequeathing to it a
   sum of £2"Q.
      Sir Jambs Bain, who hold the office of Lord Provost of Glasgow,
   and took with him on his retirement from the civic chair of that
   great city a large measure of personal and official popularity.
      Lord   Playfair, who for        eleven years held the Chair of Chemistry
   in the University of Edinburgh, relinquishing it for              a  parliamentary
   career, and who, as a legislator, advocated            every useful measure for
   the promotion of science           and   education,    as   well as   political and
   social progress.
       I cannot conclude without mentioning that, during                  the Session,
    one of  our Fellows       has been made        a  Knight Commander of            the
    Bath, and Member of the Prussian Order                Pour   Ie Mcrite   ;  another
    has received    a   Knighthood     ;  and  a  third has been made           a  Com
    panion of the      Bath.

       1. The Chairman, on opening            the  Session, made       the   following State
 ment :—
        I   have    to congratulate the Society on the large number of
  papers      — mo.-t of them involving patient and profound research —
  tliat     were    communicated to it during                last   Session.      It will     be
  remembered that            some of them         dealt with subjects appertaining
   to     Egyptian     and   I'hiLiiician    archaeology.
        I  have    also to congratulate the           Society on the increase             of its
   members that          has taken place during            the    last   decade.      In   1 889
   there      were    -187  members      on    the roll,    in 1898        there   were    517.
   The     Fellows of the Society will have been giatitied to observe that
   three of their number            of last    Se.-.-ion   have     received     well-merited
   lionours from        the Queen.
        .V  Fellow     of this Society,       I>r  Thomas R. Phaser, Professor of
    Materia Medica          and   Clinical Medicine in           the    University     of this
    City,     has   been appointed        President of         a  Commission to          report
    upon the plague in India, and several                 scientific experts       have    been
    associated      with    him.     The     members        of   the     Commission        were
    expected to reach Bombay towards the end of last month.                               Their
    inquiries will include — "The origin                of the different outbreaks of
    plague; the manner in which the disease is communicated;                                 and
    the effects of certain Prophylactic and Curative Serums                         that   have
    been     tried  or recommended          for the disease."           They have,        I am
    sure, the      most ardent wishes         of this Society for their success in
    the supremely important investigations which                     have been devolved
    upon them.          May Medical       Science,     as  repiesented by them, gain
    another of those victories over ignorance and disease which are the
     glory of its history.
        I  have much pleasure         in announcing that the Queen                   has been
    pleased, on the recommendation of the                   Secretary for Scotland, to
     approve     of the appointment of Professor D'Ahcy Thompson, of
     University     College, Dundee, to the office of scientific member                        of
     the Fishery Board         for Scotland, vacant by the resignation of Sir

714                  Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                                  [it=.
John Murray.                 Professor Thompson, as you are aware,                              was     V;"
British           Delegate on the Behring                 Sea Fisheries, and          was recently
made a C.B. in recognition of his service.
     Mr Mack ay Bernard,                    one of our Fellows,                merits the        thanks
of all interested in meteorology in Scotland, by preventing,                                    through
a    liberal donation of £500, the closing of the Ben Nevis Observa
tories.
      One of our Secretaries,              Sir Jonx Murray, in conjunction wit_i
other scientists,             has    zealously urged on Government the desir
ability of undertaking                   an antarctic       expedition in the interests of
science, and on other grounds;                         or, at least, of co-operating            in such
an undertaking               by national subscription.                  Considering what              addi
tions to our knowledge in geology,                             natural history, meteorology,
and other departments of science                           may confidently           be    looked for
from an exploration                  of the vast and almost unknown                           antarctic
region        ;    and considering also what obviously special claims such an
enterprise should                 have    on    Great      Britain       as the     first naval and
maritime power in the world                        ;    it may well       bo regretted that            the
efforts           of Sir    John Murray, and of                 those    who have co-operated
with him, should have been hitherto unable to overcome                                          the rw
inertvr of the Government.
      Possibly the Government may have had satisfactory reasons of
a     temporary kind for its decision,                      and    if   so, let us hope         that        it
may reconsider it.                  Possibly       it   may have        been      influenced by        the
humanitarian consideration of the danger of loss of valuable life.
I >ut     even       that consideration, worthy of all respect                        as   it   is,   may
have      an exaggerated              weight attached to                it; and further,        it    is,
                                                                                                       I
believe,           quite certain that the risk of loss of life in such an expedi
tion     as       that proposed      is   very much less than            it   was not many years
ago.          Besides,      ought not       a   government or national expedition                       to
reduce unnecessary                  risk to    a   minimum, and be            a   guarantee     that    it
would be conducted by the best attainable men — men known                                               to
be courageous                without being foolhardy.                   Would      the Government
impartially re-consider its decision                      it   could hardly fail,     I     think,          to
come to the conclusion that the balance                            of reason and of true              and
    patriotic policy         is   distinctly in favour of the view urged on                       it    by
    the scientists.

•way        with   tho Government, lie is         l>y  no means to be thought of a?,
on the         whole,  a    disappointed or unsuccessful man.              An expedition,
which         lie organised      himself, at his own expense, to the islet known
as Christmas Island, has produced admirable results.                             The island,
 an upraised coral atoll, like those on which Darwin based his view
 of the formation of coral islands, is about 200 miles South of Java ;
 the depth of the ocean around it is of 3 and 4 miles ; its                             area is
 ahout 45 square miles; it is covered by a dense forest, but                           is per
 fectly healthy         ;   and its temperature        is so equable    and    perfect     that
  it might seem            to have been      in the mind's eye of the poets who
  have described           the Islands of the Blessed.
        It  has   a special    interest to the Biologist owing to being the only
  tropical island which, until             some eight       years ago, had       never been
   inhabited        by either savage          or civilised       man.      Hence      it   was
   highly desirable          to have a complete         scientific account of its fauna
   and llora before          the arrival    of introduced species.            Mr Andrews
   of tho British Museum has spent                    a  year on the island, and has
    brought back large collections;            and naturalists are looking forward
    with very       great     interest  to his account        of   his explorations and
    description of his specimens.             The first set of the natural history
    collections made by Mr Andrews has been presented                        to the British
    Museum by Sir John Murray.
         The thread      of my discourse         takes    me    to another island — one
    with the exploration of which                 this Society has been intimately
    associated.
         The British Museum             authorities      have    organised     a   Scientific
     mission to tho       island   of Socotra with these objects             in view — (1)
     to make a careful survey of the               island, (2) to solve tho question
     as to the origin of the people and of their language,                          and (.'!)
     generally, to add as much as possible to what has                       been    already
     ascertained as to its geology,         geography, ethnography, botany, and
     zoology.
          It will  be remembered         that Professor Bayi.ey          Balfour, under
      the auspices    of this Society, visited the island in 1880 for the pur
      pose of   investigating its botany        ;  and that although his time was
      very   limited,  extending only to 48 days, the results wero extra
      ordinarily rich.        It so happened that in the spring of the follow
       ing year a   German scientific expedition — known                as  the   "Kiebetk

716            Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                    \_ses.
Expedition" — also explored          the  island; but that only turned              or.
to the advantage        both of Professor Bayley and our Society.                 Pro
fessor Bayley had given         kindly   counsel     and   aid to   Dr Schwein-
furth, the botanist of the Riebeck              expedition, and     Dr Schwein-
furth, with rare self-abnegation and generosity, responded by sub
sequently sending his botanical collections             to  Professor Bayley, in
order that the whole flora might be worked out in one.                   An    entire
volume of our Transactions (vol. xxi., published in 1888) is devoted
to the Botany of Socotra.           That volume contains Schweinfurth's
botanical results worked up with those              of the Balfour expedition,
and nearly all that is known of the botany of Socotra, as the ex
pedition of Mr and Mrs Bent,             a couple    of years ago, added little
to it.
    MM. Ogilvie         Grant and II. 0. Forbes of           the new expedition
have   just   gone out, and    will remain for five months.           By   the new
expedition the survey question          will, it  is believed,   be fairly tackled
 for the first time.      The ethnographic question will be dealt with,
 and   an attempt       made   to advance      towards the settlement of              it
 farther    than Schweinfurth.         As   to   the   geology    and biology        of
 Socotra, previous expeditions have            given definite knowledge,          but
 further exploration will, of course, add much to it in the way                      of
 details.     It is thought unlikely,     however, that there will be           any
 thing    so   startling   as the disclosures      which    the   explorations       of
 twenty years ago furnished.          Dr Forbes, the botanist of         the party,
 will endeavour       to send  home    seeds    and living plants of         several
 species, valuable from a horticultural          point of view.      The Begonia
 Sncotrana brought home by Balfour's expedition is now in                   general
 culture in Europe, and,       as the  parent of an entirely new race,            has
 revolutionised Begonia culture.
    In conclusion, Dr          Thaquair,      from    whom      the   Society     has
 received    so  many valuable contributions, read in            July  last papers
 on   " A new      species  of Cephalaspis discovered by the Geological

 died during the preceding Session,                  I will  give a few short notices
 of the deceased, which               are   by no means        intended to supersede

  M.I),      and L. R.C.I', in I806, ho entered tho Bengal medical
  service     in 1858, in which            he   remained      for   thirty  years.       He
  obtained the qualification of F.R.C.S.                   Edinburgh      in 18G3.        In
  1878 he served in the Afghan                  war.     Edinburgh      University     con
  ferred on him the degree of              LL.I).   in 1889.
       He was distinguished            as  a  botanical explorer, and during the
  last thirty years       added much to our knowledge of oriental                    floras.
   In   1878    Lord Roberts, then in          command       of the Kuram field force,
  applied to the Government for his services                      as  botanist with the
   Army.        There afterwards appeared in the Journal of the Linnean
   Society in 1880 and 1881, two papers detailing his discoveries                       and
   observations in tho valleys of the Kuram and Koraia rivers.
       In   1884    Dr Aitchison        was appointed scientific officer with            the
   Afghan Delimitation            Commission, and spent two years in Northern
   Baluchistan, the Helmund Valley, and the other districts in Central
   Asia traversed       by the Commission.             The results     of these explora
    tions were embodied          in   a paper    printed by the Linnean Society in
    their Transactions for 1887.               Dr Aitchison       was an indefatigable
    collector.      His Afghan       and Central Asian         collections amounted        to

died at l'riory Terrace, Kew Green, on 30th September 189S.
      I)r John Caird              was    a    native of Greenock, born in December
 1820.        He studied at Glasgow University,                          and in 1845 graduated
M.A.          In   the same year he was                 ordained minister of Xewton-on-
Ayr; in        1847 he was transferred to                  Lady Yester's Parish Church,
Edinburgh          ;   again, after an interval of two years, he became minister
of the Parish of             Errol   ;   and in 1857 he was called to Park Parish
Church, Glasgow.               In   1860 the degree of             D.D.    was conferred on hie:
by his Alma Mater             ;   in 1862 ho was appointed Professor of Divinity
in Glasgow University               ;    and in 1S73, on the death of                 Dr Barclay,
he became Principal                and Vice-Chancellor                 of the College.
      I)r Caird        was one of the greatest preachers                   of this century.           He
had      in   a    high      degree,      and    in admirable              combination, all the
qualities of an attractive and impressive                               pulpit orator.     He had
also exquisite literary taste, and hence                           even     his printed sermons
have        had great       popularity.
      Ho was likewise an independent                       and original thinker            ;    and    a
stimulating and influential teacher of theology.                              His "Introduction
tt>   the Philosophy           of Religion"         and his volume               on      "Spinoza"
attest his philosophical ability.
      As Principal of the University                    of (llasgow he displayed much
administrative capacity,                 and was greatly respected and admired.
      lie had      a   very distinct personality;                  one characterised by sim
plicity and strength, self-restraint, dignity, and susceptibility only
to ambition of          a   noble kind.
      His   death occurred on the very day when his resignation of the
Principalship,          which he had held for                  a   quarter of    a   century,    took
place, and on the 3rd of August                         last   he was        laid to rest in      the
town of his birth among                   many tokens of sorrow and regard.
      Dr Caird         was elected        an Honorary              Fellow of this Society             in

United        Presbyterian   Church,    he    was   ordained pastor of             the
Greyfriars Church, Glasgow. Tins post he held till his appoint
ment, in 1^08, to the Chair of Moral Philosophy in the University
of Edinburgh.          Previously   to   that appointment, from              1861    to
 18G-4, he was Examiner         in Philosophy in the University of Glas
 gow, and in 18G6, at the request of the Senatus, he conducted                     the
 class of Moral Philosophy in that University.              At   the early age of

 a work
             " On the Eolations of Mind and Brain," another entitled
 " Science and Religion."          His last important work was on " The
 Evolution       of Man's   Place in Nature."        In   1880     he    was elected
  Moderator      of the United     Presbyterian Synod, and was the first
  chairman of the Edinburgh School Board.               Ho took      a deep    interest
  in   the movement      for uniting the three Presbyterian Churches of
  Scotland.       He received   the degree of     LL.D. from        the University
  of Glasgow.        He was elected   a  Eellow of this Society in 1809, and
  died on 19th November 1898.
       l)r  Calderwood was held in high esteem by all classes and con
   ditions of men, and was active         in the most varied spheres of             use
   fulness.     It  was a necessity of his life to be zealously            aireeted   in
   whatever lie deemed good.          He was     a most considerate          and loyal
   colleague.      He  was   a  stout   contender     for   what      he   held to    be
   philosophical truth.      He had greatly at heart educational progress
   and social reform.      Few men took       a broader    or more sensible        view
   of the relations between      religion and science.         lie    was an active,
    courageous,    and patriotic citizen.     He was    a singularly fair-minded
    and    peace-loving churchman.         He was, emphatically,            and in all
    relations, a wise and good man, whoso memory              well deserves to        be
    cherished.

    his early education at the old       Bishop's College,, Bristol, and subse

    Emeritus      Professor     Matthew       Forster Heddlk was born               at
 Malsettar, in Hoy, one of the Orkney Islands.                 He   was educated
 at Edinburgh       Academy, and subsequently at Merchiston                 Castle,
 where he gained       a  school-prize for   a  herbarium, the plants of which
 he had    collected.      On leaving school he went through the medics!
 curriculum in the University of Edinburgh,              and in 1851 he gradu
 ated   M.D., his thesis being        "The    Ores of the Metals."      He     then
 commenced       practice   in Edinburgh,      but having found medical work
 uncongenial, he abandoned it.             Soon after this,   in 1856, he went
 to Faro.', and collected a large quantity of fine zeolites.            In    1856
 l>r Heddle      became     assistant  to the Professor of Chemistry         at St

Geognosy of Scotland,'' and eight papers to the Transaction* of this
Society, entitled
                       " Chapters on the Mineralogy of Scotland."               His
great collection of Scottish Minerals, the outcome of the labour of
a   lifetime,    became,     partly by purchase and         partly by gift, the
property of the nation, and is now displayed in the                   Edinbur^i
 Museum of Science           and Art.      He was elected      a Fellow    of this

 and   Allied   Questions.

    The General Secretary read the following special account of the
reasons for the award       : —
     In awarding the Keith Medal and Prize for a second time to Dr
Thomas Muir, the Royal Society desires to express its sense of the
importance of the continuation of Dr Muir's Researches in the
Theory of Determinants             and its Applications.       Since 1883 he has
enriched the Proceedings and Transactions                  of the Society with        a
continuous stream of papers, many of them                  containing new results
 of permanent         importance,     others co-ordinating,        extending,      and
 tracing to their sources theorems            already known, and all of these
 marked by the peculiar analytical sagacity which is familiar to the
 re ider of    Dr Muir's mathematical writings.
      Prominent among         these   memoirs     is a series of papers       on the
  Tlteory of Determinants in the Historical Order of its Development.
 The series contains the most complete bibliography of the subject
 in existence,     accompanied by       a  critical analysis and comparison of
 the various memoirs           from the dawn        of the theory to       its latest
 modern development.              This monograph will form          a monument of
  the learning and mathematical acumen               of its author more enduring
 than the Keith Medal           ; for it cannot fail to remain         a permanent
 chapter in       the  history of mathematics,         which will     no doubt be
 added to by future investigators, but which                will never    be  wholly
 superseded.
      The Makdougall-Brisbane          Prize for the period 1S96-98            having
  been    awarded by the Council            to  Dr William Pkddib, for his
  papers on the Torsional         Rigidity of Wires, the      prize was presented,
  the   General Secretary reading the following               statement    as to the
  reasons for its award       : —
      The Makdougall-Brisbane           prize for 1896-9S        is awarded to Dr
  William Peddie in recognition chiefly of his experimental               researches
  in physical science.        In his investigations       on the   torsional rigidity
  of   wires,   he has studied the         effect of   large oscillations     on    the
  elasticity of the wire, thus supplementing                 in  a  very important
   direction Lord Kelvin's well-known              results for small oscillations.
   In  the second paper, communicated to the Society in 1896                  (Trans
   actions,   vol. xxxviii.) the formula which had been found to repre
  sent with great accuracy the relation between range of oscillations

and number of oscillations,             was much more           fully verified, and     a
relation     was found     to exist between          two of the parameters        under
varied conditions of fatiguo of the wire and initial ranges of
oscillation.      In the third paper (Transactions, vol. xxxix., 1893),
the law of change of the parameters was further investigated, and
an important       common      feature     holding throughout the whole series
of experiments       was brought to light, indicating the existence               of an
absolute constant, probably characteristic of the material composing
the oscillating wire.         By     a  neat piece of statistical mathematics,
 I)r    Peddie    showed how not only the                  phenomena of torsional
 oscillations,    but also other known             phenomena,       such   as deviation
 from Hooke's Law and            the relation between          torsion and set, could
 be deduced theoretically          as  illustrative      of Maxwell's     views of the
 constitution    of  a molecular .solid.          In  its application     to vibrations
 this theoretical investigation required               the time of outward swing
 through     a given range to be less than tho time of inward swing —
 the experimental verification of which was one of the new results
 contained in the paper.
      In another contribution        to the    Transactions       of the .Society,   I)r
  Peddie gave    a  very thorough investigation into an apparently unique
  case of colour-blindness.         It  was a case of what is termed            yellow-
  blue or violet-blindness, but it differed from known examples of such
  cases in the total absence        of appreciation of green, and in the fact
  that tho visible spectrum suffered no shortening at the violet end.
      Among other papers communicated to the Society and published
  in the     Proceedings, the one          on the     Law of Transformation            of
  Energy and its Applications calls for more than passing notice.                     In
  it various known       expressions        connecting        physical quantities are
  deduced by simple reasoning          based upon generalised          Carnot's cycles
  — the usual      methods      of   derivation       of these     results employing
  processes of higher mathematics.
      The   Neill Prize     for the       period    1895-1)8      was    presented    to
   Professor   Cossar Ewart, for his             recent     investigations connected
   with Telegony.
      Sir John Murray read the following                statement    as to the reasons
   for the award   :—
      The Council     have   awarded the Neill prize to Professor Cossar

732          Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
Ewart for     a series  of papers published partly in the Proceedings            of
the   Society    and partly     elsewhere.      In   these     papers   Professo:
Ewart   has recorded an elaborate         series of experiments designed          to
investigate several      questions    of great importance bearing          on   the
theory of heredity.        More especially, he        has    inquired    into   the
subject of Telegony, and      as the   result of his experiments in crossicg
several mares with       a male   zebra, and subsequently          with  a sire of
their own stock, he considers        that strong evidence        is given against
tho   theory of infection by        a   previous sire, which        has  been     so
strongly believed in by breeders of stock.              He considers that       the
character observed      in the offspring can be more satisfactorily             ex
plained by the simpler doctrine of Reversion or Atavism.                Although
reversion does not invariably occur, even when extreme forms                    are
crossed,  it is the usual result of intercrossing and hybrid            breeding.
Ilis experiments     also show that intercrossing leads to variation,          and
thus gives species     a chance    of adapting themselves          to changes in
the environment.        He attaches      great importance to the influence
of prepotency,    so that a distinct      variety may not only hand on its
own characteristics, but also absorb the chief points of the variety
with which it is mated.        In  the course of these experiments he has
obtained   a  number of horse embryos at various stages of develop
ment, and has in consequence        been able to work out many interest
ing facts in the life-history of this animal.
