 Professor Sir DOUGLAS MACLAGAN,                                    Vice-President,
                                   in the Chair.
                      Chairman's Opening Address.
                              (Read December      3, 1888.)
    It  is a time-honoured       custom in this as in other learned societies,
that the annual Session shall be inaugurated and its last meeting
closed     by an address from the Chair, and it is my duty now to say
a   few words to you on the occasion of the opening of our 106th
Session.
     I would have shrunk           from undertaking         this duty, but for the
reason      that our indefatigable          Secretary,     Professor Tait,     has   ex-
piscated the fact that          I  am the only one           of the Society's Vice-
Presidents who has never given any address                     from the Chair, and
thus the Council of the Society was led to insert in their minutes
a request     — almost equivalent         to a command — that            I  should say
something to you on the present occasion.                   I comply with this, not
 from any feeling that         I  am qualified to do so, but on the principle
that those who accept the honours of the Society have no right to
do so without         attempting, however imperfectly,               to discharge the
 relative duties.
     I can at all events       congratulate you on the prosperous             condition
 of the Society as regards the number of Fellows.                      The roll of the
 Society     at   present   contains     494     Ordinary      Fellows,    32   Foreign
 Honorary Fellows, and 19 British Honorary Fellows.                        In reference
 to our Ordinary         Fellowship,      I   cannot    refrain    from adverting to
 an    opinion     which   I  have     heard expressed        in   reference   to  their
 number, that there must be too great facilities for admission to their
 ranks.      I  demur to this         opinion.      It   is not necessary      that we
 should maintain         that all our        Fellows    are   special cultivators     of
 science ;     but, setting asido for       a  moment the department of litera
 ture,   I am    persuaded    that all who arc admitted here have shown
 before they have         passed     the somewhat prolonged              ordeal of the
 Council,      and have     been     put before      the   Society for ballot, have
 taken a real interest,,        by study or otherwise, in the progress                of
 science, and are desirous,          so far as lies in their power,         to promote
 its advancement.

 1SSS-S9.]               Chairman's Opening Address.                                     3
     This is not the place or time for discussing what is the hest basis
upon which the election           of Fellows to such       a Society as ours should
rest,  whether by our system of petition — recommendation by four
existing Fellows,      and subsequent scrutiny by           the Council of evidence
in the candidate's         favour— or by the        selection   of a limited number
of names of those        who have,      so to speak, won their spurs by original
work.      We must bear           in mind that       science   is not nowadays the
areanum       of the philosopher, and that every day shows                    more and
more     how indissolubly science           is mixed up with         those   great prac
tical works     which so powerfully influence            the material prosperity of
the   country   — (we need not         go for this beyond the realms         of Physics
 and Chemistry)       — and      that there are many among us whoso occupa
 tions or    inclinations       do not permit of their working              at scientific
 research,    but who yet know           the value of     it for practical      purposes,
 and who are         deeply interested       in learning,   as directly as possible,
  either  by the hearing of the ear from the scientist himself, or by
  the  perusal of the papers in our T ransadions and Proceedings, what
  he has to      tell  them.      I am always glad to welcome such men into
  our ranks.
      As regards financial matters,            those   who have looked into the
   abstract of the accounts of our excellent Treasurer                will  see  that the
   income    for   the past sessional     year was exceeded by the expenditure
   to  the extent of about £235.               We need not be alarmed             at this.
    Most of it is accounted for by the expenditure on one item, the im
    portant volume of the           "Botany of Socotra;"             and the finances
    otherwise are    in  a satisfactory state.
       Of  course    the heaviest     item    in our annual expenditure             is the
    printing of the Traiisadions          and Proceedings,      which amounted         last
    year to about £780.           This cannot     be avoided.      These publications
    are an essential   object of our    existence, but assuredly every endeavour
    is made to have this done as economically as is consistent                   with the
    prime requisite     of  accuracy.
       Thb allusion       to our publications       leads me to notice certain new
    arrangements      which the Council have made with              a  view to expedit
    ing the issue of the Transactions and Proceedings.                  With this view
    they have     resolved    that each memoir in the           T ransadions      shall be
    printed separately,      and be obtainable as soon        as ready,    without wag
    ing for the completion         of a part of a volume.          Those Fellows who

4            Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.               [sess.
desire   it can, as at present,    have the Transactions in the volume
form.     The Proceedings     will be issued  in parts  as soon as sixty-four
pages are   in type and    passed for press, so that they may thus sooner
be   in the hands of Fellows.          Occasional delays in bringing         out
Transactions and Proceedings are unavoidable, especially in the case
of the former, which may have to be illustrated by plates requiring
great   nicety and skill on the part of the artist; but that need
hardly occur in regard to the Proceedings,        if authors will only  second
the endeavours of the Council by promptitude in furnishing abstracts
and reports of papers.        The issuing of parts      will not   be stopped
when sixty-four     pages are ready, because some author may not send
in his MS.    ;  and  if it occurs that such    papers are not made public
till after the  issue of others which should not have         preceded them,
the author      must blame      himself.    If   due attention     is  paid   to
promptitude, the issue of Proceedings may be made               as   regular as
that of a serial publication.
   A   further new arrangement is that writers of papers who                will
furnish,    when the paper is sent in, an abstract of not more than
twelve lines, may have this inserted in the billet of the meeting at
which the paper is to be read, and thus inform the Society of the
nature and scope of the subject to bo discussed.
    There is one point regarding which         the   Council is not in a con
dition   to congratulate the Society, viz., on its local habitation.        The
want of accommodation for our books, now forming a large and
most important scientific library, has long been          a  subject of much
lamentation, and those who may chance to find their way into the
penetralia to the south of the Hall, and find a staircase filled with
books to the roof, must have occasionally experienced the dread of
their possibly being overwhelmed by a literary avalanche, and              have
wondered how in such circumstances our worthy Librarian                     can,
•without    personal danger, find anything       there  that may be desired
of him.      We must, however, in the meantime live in               hope   that
 the building which the munificence of an unknown donor is erecting
in  Queen Street, and to which       some   of the contents of the Royal
Institution   are to be removed, may enable the Trustees of the Board
 of Manufactures     to find some     extension of accommodation for the
 Royal Society.
    It is impossible, when mentioning        our library, to avoid noticing

a   bibliographic    event      in which      we all   have   a   deep   interest.     I
allude to the near     completion of         the Challenger Reports.
    This monumental         work, so interesting from the importance and
novelty of the results it has given to the world, is the most extensive
and perhaps the mo-t valuable record of a scientific voyage ever
published by any nation, and it is due to the skilful supervision and
indomitable      energy      of the editor, my brother Vice-President, Dr
John Murray, that the work, notwithstanding its unparalleled                      mag
nitude, has been      brought       so soon and successfully to a close.
    To another matter of            great   public interest,  though not directly
connected     with the work of            the Royal    Society, a short reference
may be     permitted.         The Universities (Scotland) Bill has long been
before the    nation, and has been the subject of much discussion and
Eome    opposition.        It  would, of course, be entirely out of place for
 me to say    anything        either in the way of approval or criticism of            a
 measure now before Parliament, and I would not have alluded                          to
 it but for a single noteworthy circumstance.
     Among the original provisions was one proposing the transference
 of the Royal Observatory              and the Royal      Botanic Garden to the
  custody   of the University of Edinburgh,             which threatened       to pro
  duce   opposition from many quarters, including                among     others    our
  municipal     authorities.       These    bones   of contention     have    happily
  been taken out      of  the way, the one directly and the other indirectly,
   by the munificent      action of the Earl of Crawford.
     Our learned Vice-President, Lord M'Laren, whose                   absence     from
   among us, owing to bad health, we all so much regret, in his open
   ing address    to the Society this time last year, expressed the hope
   that the  Edinburgh Observatory, in            accordance    with the agreement
   between    its founders and the Government of the day, would be
    maintained as   a national institution properly endowed and adequately
   equipped.      This wish of the        learned   Lord is in    prospect   of being
   realised in  a  way that could not have been thought of twelve months
   ago.   By his gift       to the nation of his celebrated          Observatory at
    Dunecht, with the powerful            instruments and valuable apparatus,
    which the noble Earl has accumulated           at an immense cost, along       with
   his astronomical     library, the most complete          collection in the king
   dom   of works referring to his favourite science, Lord Crawford has
   secured for Scotland a national observatory, not by the retention of

6              Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                     [sess.
the old one on the Calton            Hill, but by    the erection     of  a new one    in
the vicinity of Edinburgh.              Government has accepted the gift,             has
undertaken to provide           a  suitable site and buildings, and to increase
the endowment.           It  is to be hoped        that   as little  delay as   possible
will   occur  in carrying this       out, and    that before      long Scotland      may
be put in possession         of this princely     gift — the   bestowal    of which    by
her premier Earl is worthy                to  stand    beside    the   noblest of     the
achievements       that have been recorded in the Lives of the Lindsays.
    I  have    no occasion       to take    any retrospect      of the    past Session,
because that was done on 16th              July in     his closing address       by Pro
fessor    Flint, who then          summarised       what had been done in the
Society, and also noticed those Fellows who had during the Session
been     removed      by    death.      Only   one addition       has been    made     to
our deathdist of Fellows              since   the close of last Session,          in the
person of     Dr William Wallace, F.C.S., public analyst                 to the  City of
Glasgow, which took             place    at his residence      at   Hillhead on 5th
November.         For two       years    Dr Wallace had          been    in somewhat
feeble    health, and for         a  month he was entirely confined to the
house.      While his death thus did not                come    unexpectedly to his
more intimate friends, the sad intelligence was received with surprise
by many people not only in the City of Glasgow, but throughout all
the country, by whom, both on professional and personal                         grounds,
he was highly        esteemed.        Dr Wallace, who        had    reached    his 56th
year, began his professional career in Glasgow                    as  assistant   to the
late   Dr Penny     at the Andersonian          College.     He held this appoint
ment for a number of years.                He was next appointed Lecturer to
 the Mechanics' Institute          (now the College of Science and Arts), and
this position he held for several years.                  In 1870 he entered into
partnership with Mr Tatlock               and Dr Clarke, and for many years
 a large    and   important business         was carried on by the firm.             The
 office of   Public Analyst for the City of Glasgow                  was conferred on
 Dr Wallace in        1874,     and,   besides    discharging the duties of this
 appointment to the satisfaction of the Town                     Council,    he held    a
 number of similar offices, in all of which, by his great skill as                      a
 chemist,     and    his    courteous     and   agreeable      manner to all with
 whom he came in contact, ho extended his reputation and secured
 the esteem of a wide circle of friends.                   In conjunction with Dr
 liussell,  the medical officer of health          for the city, he was the author

of a series           of papers published in                1879 dealing with the subjects of
'•
     The Prevention and Control                          of Infectious Diseases," and                 " Air,
Water  Supply, Sewage Disposal, and Food," the portion under the
lattertitle being contributed by Dr Wallace. He was also the
author of a very large number of pamphlets, and of papers contri
buted to Societies                  on a     great variety of subjects.                   Dr Wallace    was
for many              years an active and valuable member                               of the Glasgow
Philosophical            Society,           of    which     some         years    ago     he was elected
President
     Having no retrospect                    to take,     I look       to the future       with    a special
regard to those             places        where     work has been, or is being done, and
from which we may expect contributions to the work of the Society
during the present Session. I say nothing of what is being done in
the quiet of the laboratories by the physicist or chemist, which as
yet is          known       only       to    the workers, and                  may     furnish    abundant
materials for papers at our meetings.                                I would      speak    of   those opera
tions          which are        more        or less in the public eye, and which may
equally contribute to furnish us with papers of interest and value.
The general survey entitles me to say that there is no lack of
 scientific activity in Scotland at present.
          1   shall perhaps be pardoned                   if,   in   a   spirit of esprit de corps,      I
 first mention            the Laboratory of Research of the Royal College of
     Physicians of Edinburgh, under the able superintemlenceship of Dr
     Woodhead.            It   is
                                a     personal gratification to me to think that the
     movement           for establishing this Laboratory                         was    inaugurated and
     carried out when       I        had the honour of               filling   the Chair of the Royal
     College     ;    but the merit         is   in no   respect due to me, but to the energy
     and perseverance           of    a   member         of our Council, Dr Batty-Tuke.                   It
              great satisfaction to know that not only have we the prospect
     is
     a
     of the original        investigations           made        there     being communicated to
     the      world    through        the Royal          Society, but that we have                  had an
     earnest      for the future in          the shape of papers already read before us,
     and      now in the course of publication;                          and
                                                                           I     may be permitted to
     add, as     an office-bearer         of the Royal College, that this development
     is   an evidence, among other instances,                        that medical         corporations do
     not      gather funds for selfish purposes, but are ready and willing to
     use      them for the advancement of scientific knowledge.
          Next, I      would        point    to another field of scientific work as one

which strongly appeals          not only to those who take special                 interest
in the rapidly progressing science of Meteorology, but to                      thousands
beyond the limits of Scotland, and especially to those who go                         down
to the sea in ships.          My look      here   is directed up       to the       highest
inhabited spot in Great          Britain — to our Observatory           on Bun       Nevis.
Every daily      newspaper       keeps under our eyes tlio work that is                done
there, and     I am sure that all of         you will join with me in paying                   a
tribute of admiration to the unremitting self-denying labours of                          the
superintendent, Mi' Oraond, and those who are associated with him.
It will interest the Society to learn from authentic sources what has
recently been done there.
    The work of observing at the Ben Nevis                     Observatory continues
to be prosecuted       by night and by day with energy and success, and
five years' observations have now been made.                     These observations,
combined with          those    made     at    Fort William, contribute           the best
data    yet available for the investigation of those fundamental ques
tions in atmospheric physics, viz., the rate of diminution                           of the
temperature      with height, and of            pressure    with height, for air tem
peratures     and sea-level        pressures.       The     valuable results already
arrived at have been utilised in the construction of the new iso
thermal and isobaric charts of the globe now being prepared for the
 Challenger Expedition          Reports.
    Data of invaluable character             have   been contributed         for the solu
 tion   or elucidation       of such      important       questions   as     the diurnal
 changes    in   the velocity and        direction of        the wind    ;   the    relation
between     temperature      and wind      ;  the hygrometry of the atmosphere                ;
earth    currents   :  glories,   halos, corona?, and other optical phenomena
 in   their relations      to   cloud crystals.           Photography       has    recently
been added to the observers'            instrumental means on Ben Nevis, and
it  is interesting to note that a few days ago a case of St Elmo's Fire
at tiie Observatory was successfully photographed.
    I  venture to quote       a sentence      from   the.  Report of  a    Committee of
 the Royal Society appointed to co-operate                 with  the Scottish        Meteo
rological    Society in making            meteorological observations              on    Ben
 Nevis.
    The    Directors     of the Observatory            are    maturing     a   plan for     a
thorough      discussion of the Ben Nevis               and Fort William observa
tions in their        scientific and practical           bearings.    This plan         .will

 1SS8-S9.]                Chairman's         Opening Address.                          9
require    for the carrying of it out a small additional staff, working
in conjunction with the office in Edinburgh and the staff of the
Ben Nevis Observatory, for a period of at least three years.
    In connection with the practical side of the inquiry, the
Directors refer with the greatest satisfaction to the publication, by
General Greely, Chief Signal-Officer of the United States Army, of
daily Weather Charts of the Atlantic, beginning with October 1886.
These charts have          been partially examined in connection with the
Ben    Nevis Observations, and it is not possible to over-estimate their
importance         in the     large    inquiry now in contemplation by               the
Directors as to the relations of these observations                 to the weather of
North-Western Europe, which is truly an international undertaking.
 With the United States charts will be conjoined the observations of
storms and other phenomena made at the Scottish lighthouses, as
 described      in previous     reports, and the bi-daily charts         of the Meteor
 ological Office.         One of the points to            which     attention   will  be
 specially given        will be to ascertain     the earliest time at which storms,
 seen to be advancing            over   the  Atlantic    towards     Europe, could be
  signalled      from the Ben Nevis observations in combination with
  observations        at lower levels     ; and   further, to endeavour        from an
  investigation        of the    bearings    of Ben Nevis        observations    on the
   movements         and  courses of anticyclones, to        ascertain    the  path the
   advancing cyclone will take, whether to the north of, across, or to
   the south      of  the British Islands in its     easterly   course.
       The     Directors   have    from    the   commencement         insisted   on  the
   necessity of an observatory at Fort William, near sea-level, at which
    hourly observations can be recorded,             in order that the observations
    made     at the top of Ben Nevis shall be properly utilised in their
    scientific and practical bearings.
       It   is   especially   satisfactory     to   note   that the     Meteorological
    Council have granted          .£250    towards the maintenance          of the low-
    level observatory, and        that the Committee of the Edinburgh             Inter
    national Exhibition of 1886 have dedicated £1000 of the surplus
    funds to this important object.            Is it too much     to expect that some
    of   the   surplus    of the magnificent Glasgow             Exhibition,     on  the
     success   of which we can so cordially congratulate               the  City of  the
     West,    may, by favourable         meteorological     influence, be wafted to
     Fort  William?

    The whole of the hourly and other                  observations made      at    the
Observatory and at Fort William are now through the press,                          but
the Report accompanying the observations is not yet completed.                         It
is anticipated that the Report will be finished and through the                 press
by the end of      January next.
    In  the department of Biology            there    is  also a large    amount      of
scientific activity, which is of hopeful augury               as  to the  furnishing
of papers for our meetings.
    There are a great many young scientists now occupied                     with  the
study of Microbiology — a study                most     important    not merely      as
regards     its scientific     interest,   but   from    its practical bearing       on
pathology and public health.              Its dealings with pathological ques
tions will most properly be brought under the notice of the                   strictly
professional societies ;        but it is needless to say that, in reference to
hygiene,     it is of high practical interest to everybody,          and any results
which may bo obtained may appropriately find their way to                          the
 public through our Proceedings.
    The Society does not need to be informed as to the work which
 for four years has been carried on at the Scottish Marine Station,
 both at Granton on the east and at Millport on the west coast, an
 interesting account of which has been given by Mr Iloyle in No.                    II.
 of the   Journal of     the  Marine. Biological Association.
    At   the Marine Station, Granton, the chemico-biological work has
 been steadily carried        on on the same lines as during last year.           The
 investigations     as   to the secretion      of carbonate of lime by animals,
 and   the solubility of lime (in its different molecular states) in sea-
 water, have yielded results of considerable               interest and importance
 as  bearing     upon the formation of coral and shell deposits, and on
 their rescue from destruction in the ocean.               Experiments have been
 made as to the actual composition                of sea-water    ; such   results   as
 indicate any advance          in this direction will, it is hoped,       be brought
  before the Society during the Session.
     Not   less interesting and important are the              investigations which
  have   been    made,     and   are  still going    on, at the     instance  of   the
  Fishery Board,      as   bearing upon the enormously important industry
  of the sea.
     The scientific work in connection             with the fisheries of Scotland
  may   be said      to   have    taken rise with the establishment of             the

1S5S-S9.]                Chairman's         Opening Address.                        11
present     Fishery Board, -which succeeded the old Board of Com
missioners for the British White Herring Fisheries in 1882 ; and
the scientific     work has been undergoing gradual expansion                 year by
year since the new         Board     was formed, largely owing to the energy
of Professor      Ewart and Sir James Maitland.
    The work which           has    "been   accomplished may be conveniently
referred     to under three heads — (1) General Fishery Questions,                 (2)
Biological Observations,           and (3) Physical Observations.
     Among general questions, which do not so much concern us here,
may      be   mentioned the investigations of the " Garland " into the
influence of various modes of fishing, especially in territorial waters,
the     preservation of       fish, specially studied by Professor        Ewart, and
various other matters which are set forth in the last two Reports of
 the   Fishery Board.        At  the present time experiments are being carried
 on    regarding the artificial cultivation of           mussels on the    French or
 l>otichot    system, and investigations          are  in  progress  on the relative
 efficiency of different baits, and on            the possibility of devising arti
  ficial substitutes.
      The biological investigations have naturally ranged over a wide
  variety of subjects, and these can only be referred to summarily.
   One of the earliest questions to engage the attention of the new
   Board was the natural history of the herring, and                  several   papers
    have been published in the various Reports on                     the   structure,
    spawning,      development, food, and migrations of this familiar fish,
    which still forms      the greatest source of wealth         in connection with
    the fisheries of Scotland.         These    inquiries were extended later to
     other groups of edible fisbes       ; and the most complete         account yet
     given of the food of most            of them,     such   as the  cod,   haddock,
     whiting,    &c, will   be found    in  the Reports of the Scottish Board ;
     and an     inquiry into the structure of        the digestive system     and the
     cognate processes of digestion in fishes, was also made the subject of
     a  special  investigation by Professor Stirling of Owens College.
         The vertebrate and invertebrate fauna of several districts, especi
     ally in the Clyde and in the Firth of Forth, have been very com
     pletely worked up, a considerable number of species, either new to
      science or new to Britain,     have    been recorded; and the        occurrence
      of rare fishes has been described       from time to time.      Inquiries have
      also been   carried on into pathological questions connected with fish

12            Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                    [sess
life, and papers have been published dealing specially with the                 fungi
and micro-organisms        which occur in the waters of our salmon            rivers,
and which are more or less inimical to their inhabitants.
    Investigations were also made into the development              of the  common
mussel, which is so important in connection with the supply of                    bait
to fishermen.
    The Fishery Board has also carried on              a series  of inquiries     into
the temperature       and other changing physical conditions of the               sea,
which are known to exert an important influence on the movements
and habits of fish.         These investigations, the results of which              are
published in the various Reports, have been partly conducted                         at
certain    stations  on the coast, partly during the routine work of               the
cruisers engaged in fishery service, and partly during special               expedi
tions of these vessels.
    In  connection     with the physical work done under the auspices                of
the Fishery Board,        a  short but interesting expedition started from
 Granton in the beginning of September,              under the guidance of          Dr
John Gibson,       the  Admiralty granting       the use of     H.M.S. "Jackal,"
 which was duly fitted up with           a  laboratory for the occasion.          One
 of the objects of the expedition, which lasted for about six weeks,
 was   to   establish    communications        with    Norwegian,     Danish,      and
 German observers,         and for     this              the    " Jackal   "
                                                                              visited
                                              purpose
 Bergen,    Copenhagen,      and Kiel.
     Another object kept in view was to arrange for new observation
 stations on the east coast of Scotland, the Orkneys and Shetland,
 and at the same time to make some further investigations regarding
 sea-water.      These observations     embraced the temperature,        alkalinity,
 specific   gravity, and amount of carbonic acid, both free and com
 bined, at different points in the            North    Sea, Baltic,    and Sound       ;
 further, the amount of carbonic acid in the atmosphere was                  as  often
 as possible    also determined,   the micro-organisms        in the air were also
 looked for, and the organisms          in the surface water got by the tow-
 net.
     The observations       made are in course of being completed,              and it
 may be hoped that the Fishery Board             will not   object to some of the
 results being laid before the      lioyal    Society.
     A  large amount of important biological work has also been done
 at the St Andrews Marine Laboratory, under Frofessor                  M'lutosh,     of

1858-89.]                     C?m   irman's Opening Address.                                           13
which also a report               will be   found in No.               II.   of the Journal of the
Marine Biological Association.
      Keference      may be made here to               a    further work now being carried
on    in England in connection with marine biology.                               The Laboratory
of the Marine          Biological Association of                 the   United Kingdom, which
owes its        existence mainly to the labours of Professor Lankester, was
opened a few             months         ago at Plymouth,              and    in point of         size and
equipment          takes rank among the first of such institutions through
out       the world, considering the short time the laboratory has been
established.             A    considerable        amount of work                has    been already
done, and the   lines of future investigations have been laid down.
A list of the fanna and flora of Plymouth Sound has been compiled,
and       researches      have      been    begun on the breeding of the sole, pil
chard, herring,              conger,     &c, and      the       development of the lobster,
various         shrimps,      and other crustacean               It    is proposed         to make        an
exhaustive study of the fauna of the Sound, and of the connection
between          varying physical conditions and                  the distribution          and migra
tory movements               of   the   organisms.          There can be little doubt that,
now that            it has     been     fairly   started,       this laboratory will prove an
important means of extending our knowledge of the biology and
 physics of the sea.                "What   I    have said regarding scientific work has
 been          confined to what is being done in our own country, perhaps
 chiefly from          the selfish view that we are thence                      most       likely to   get
 contributions to our meetings and Proceedings.                                 I should,        however,
 be       doing violence to my own, and                     I   am sure also to your feelings,
 if       I   were to pass over without            note the       brilliant     achievement         of Dr
  Xansen         of Bergen, with Lieutenant Dietrichsen and Mr Sverdrup, in
 crossing        the inland ice of Greenland from east to west.  We recog
  nise        in this not     merely     scientific zeal, but that indomitable Scandi
  navian         " pluck " which filled          the nation with terror at the prowess
  of the         Xorsemen of old, but now deserves the admiration of the
  civilised       world for their hardy stalwart                descendants.          It   is,   of course,
  to      be   expected that whatever            Dr Xansen             may have to communicate
  will be told           to the scientific societies              of his own country;                but  I
  think that        I    may venture in your name to assure him that                                 if    he
  chooses        to send anything to us in Danish, we shall easily find means
     of   putting   it   in form to appear in our own Proceedings.

is no lack of            papers           now offered to the Society, and no                             reason
to     apprehend             that there               shall    he       any scarcity      in the        present
Session.
     In looking hack               at the history of the Royal Society of                         Edinburgh,
we find that            it,    like other similar bodies,                       has had its periods              of
scientific famine and mournful inactivity, but that has not been                                               the
case    for   a   length of time.                It   is         record
                                                           curious to look back at such                 a
as   the      following, given by Sir David Brewster in his Presidential
Address in December 1804.
     In    the closing years                 of the last and in the first decade of                            the
present         century the            Society was            in    a   very languid condition.                 In
each of the years                  1799,       1802, 1803,              1808,    and    1809, only one          of
the papers read at its meetings was published in the Transaetiotut,
and in 1801 and 1806                         not   a    single paper read in these years was
published.           AVhile our Transactions                            were     thus    scantily supplied
with papers, those actually read were few in number, and often too
abstruse to excite                 a   general        interest.         The regular meetings of the
Society had frequently no other business than to read the minutes,
elect      members,           and        receive        donations,         and     this was        sometimes
done       in     the    presence             of       only    the       Secretary and            one   or two
Members of Council.                          In     such      circumstances the Secretary                     sum
moned the members                       by   a     billet, printed in red ink when                      a   paper
was       to bo read,          and       one in black when he had nothing to com
municate.
     Of    course, from the immensity of its domain,                                    and the number of
questions         which       it       offers for investigation,                 Physical     Science         must
always furnish by far the largest proportion of communications read
before us.         It   is,   however,        I    think, to be regretted that               so   few literary
papers        are presented,             and there            is   a    marked     contrast between the
state of matters              in   the earliest and present position of the Society in
this respect.           It    is   to be borne          in mind         that this never was         a   Society
devoted exclusively to physical and natural science, but that origi
nally     it    consisted          of two distinct sections — the Physical                              and    the
Literary.          In   its earlier years                  the literary class was actually more
numerous than the physical, and was at least                                       as active,      seeing that
the number of papers printed in the Transactions was about equally
divided between the two classes.                               But this        was not to continue.            It
is   remarkable that man}' of the most illustrious                                     men   in the literary

section,    though it includes Robertson, Eeid, David Hume, Fergusson,
and      Adam Smith, scarcely contributed to the pages of the Trans-
aeticms     at all.     Nay, even       the elevation of      Sir "Walter Scott to the
presidency in 1820          did not bring about any literary revival,               and  it
does not       appear that       the author of Waverley            ever contributed       a
paper.       The literary section had practically ceased to exist in 1808,
and was finally         abolished     as a distinct      class in 1827.      I find that
between 1882          and 1887, while there were a few interesting papers
on social     questions, only three were read which can truly be said to
be    literary.     It   is no    disparagement        to any one to say that       in the
sphere      of physical and natural science he may hear papers road
which      are  of too technical or         abstruse    a nature to be interesting to
him, but       literary papers        seem to be generally attractive,            perhaps
from their        very rarity,      and    from the pleasant       variety which they
give to our meetings.               I  would fain hope, considering the original
constitution of the Society, that though it has no longer                      a  distinct
 literary     class, literature       may not      altogether     disappear    from the
 meetings.         Be this wish fulfilled       or not, there     seem to be abundant
 sources from        which     we might get valuable contributions              from the
  domain of science, and          I trust   that this Session will    be  in all respects
  one of     prosperity.

     The body is elongated, more markedly attenuated posteriorly                                                  than
anteriorly.                The colour is brown.                       At        the    head     end    there is a
shallow mouth cavity, and besides                                this on the lateral line at each
side       a   very prominent              papilla        ;    somewhat               further back there               is
another weakly developed.                        No           transverse             wrinkling of      the    cuticle
is to be observed                     The musculature is very strongly developed,
and is referable             to the Iiolomyarian                 type.
     The male measures on an average                                     16     mm.      in length by         4 mm.
in breadth, and is much attenuated posteriorly.                                              The oesophagus         is
short, and            occupies    only                °f       the total length.                    The tail has a
spoon-shaped               termination, which is supported by three finger-shaped
processes            (lig. 2).    The two laterals each bear three papillae,                                      the
median          two    ;   and in front of the cloaca on each side there is another
papilla with               a finger-shaped           stalk.           The two cirri             are    084 mm.
in length.              A    bursa,    with rolled margin (fig.                          4), occurs on lateral
edges of the tail in the male forms.                             Among the longitudinal muscles
there are strong oblique bursal muscles, which extend very far for
ward, for 3-2 nun.               There is        a   remarkable longitudii                      1   strand, which
consists of shining spherules,                      and lies in the ventral line in the plane
of the longitudinal muscles, whence                                 it     gives off lateral branches              at
right angles to right and left (fig. 4).
   The female measures 1G'5 mm. in length by                                             4 8 mm.      in breadth.
It   is viviparous.              The unpaired short vagina and the long paired
uteri opening into it are filled with very numerous embryos.                                                   These
measure         0'36 mm. in length by O013 mm. in breadth.                                              The     oeso
phagus occupies                       °f   the total length, and is therefore                          very short.
Close in front of the apex of the tail, which divides ii to two roundish
processes, lies the anus                   (figs.     5       and     G,       b).     In front of this           one
notices        an oval vesicular elevation of the                                cuticle, in the middle of
which the vulva appears                    in   the form of                a   transverse       slit (figs.   5   and
6,   a).        It    is    bordered       anteriorly            by      a      slight       protrusion       of the
parenchyma of the body, posteriorly by                                     a     similar thicker structure
(fig. 6).
     The six known               species        of Pseuddlius                   appear       to flourish where
there      is   an         abundant supply             of oxygen,                    since   they live in air-
containing organs or in the blood-vascular system.

Abstract          of   the    Results      of an         Inquiry into the
      Causation of Asiatic Cholera.                 By Neil Macleod, M.D.
      Edin., and Walter J. Milles, F.R.C.S. Eng.                   Communicated
      by   Dr Woodhkad.
                            (Read December    17, 1888.)
   This inquiry      was commenced       in Shanghai       at the end of 188-4,
soon after     Koch had published       some    of his results, and as he was
then almost the only worker in         the   bacteriological field of whom it
could be said that he had not published                anything, subsequently
upset, attention was directed at once         to the " comma bacillus."
   Slightly alkaline peptonised        meat    jelly on     plates  was used for
purposes     of cultivation, this being kept at a temperature            of 60° to
70° Fahr. by means of an ice chest          in hot  weather.
   The investigators worked independently,             but the majority of the
cases of cholera under observation were investigated              by both.
   For determining identity, it was         assumed    that the same organism
grown under the same conditions as to medium, temperature, and
time should have the same macroscopic,             and being subjected to the
same conditions as to stain, treatment          in mounting and examining,
the same microscopic characters.
   The characters       of identification    laid down by Koch for this
organism are now accepted         by all observers as sufficient, the name
alone being altered.        The " comma bacillus " is now regarded as a
" spirillum," but is     best known     by the former name.           The charac
ters are —
   1st.   It  occurs  in the characteristic cholera stools, and after death
in  the similar contents of the ileum.
   2nd.     It  is from one-half to two-thirds       the size of the tubercle
bacillus,     somewhat thicker      than the latter, and slightly curved.
Sometimes it occurs in           groups so as to form          a   half circle, an
S-shaped      curve, or a wavy line of varying length.
   3rd.    It  grows in and liquefies slightly alkaline            gelatine, more
slowly in neutral, scarcely        at all in slightly,       and not at all in
markedly acid gelatine.         On a gelatine plate cultivation the indi
vidual colonies are round, he in         a funnel-shaped cavity;       viewed by
transmitted light and magnified, they look like ground glass, and

 1888-89.]      Messrs Macleod and Milles on Asiatic Cholera.                          19
the    edge of the colony is finely notched.             In   a  gelatine tube there
forms    a funnel-shaped        cavity at the top of the puncture made                 by
the inoculating wire, and lying in this cavity what looks like an
inverted air-bubble with its top on             a level   with the       surface   of the
jelly, and open to the air; along the puncture the gelatine liquefies,
and in this may be seen the whitish mass of colonies, more par
 ticularly   at the lowest part ;        in from three to four        weeks     liquefac
tion spreads to the whole           mass, the   bacilli falling     to the bottom as
 a greyish-white        sediment, having        a faint    orange      tint in certain
lights, and if undisturbed, a perfectly transparent liquid                     separates
 a whitish scum on the top from the sediment below.
    4th.   A     freezing    temperature does       not     destroy      it; it     grows
 scarcely at all below 50°, slowly at 60°, rapidly from 80° to 100°
 Fahr. in gelatine cultures.
    (Tor ordinary work         these characters    suffice  for identification)
    5th.   It  is actively mobile in fluid media.
    6th. Grown on agar-agar,            it forms  a brownish, glistening           scum ;
 but this   appearance      is common to other organisms.
    7th. On potato slices, at a temperature of from 90° to 100° Fahr.,
 it  forma glistening greyish-brown            colonies, but it does not grow at
 all at ordinary room temperature.
    8th.   It  liquefies blood serum.
    9th. Growth ceases in the absence of air in gelatine cultivation.
    10th.   It is reproduced by       fission.   Spores have not been observed.
    Nearly all      observers    of this organism have          described what are
called involution forms.            These are characterised by irregularities
of shape,     so that    it requires re-inoculation and growth under ordi
nary favourable conditions to determine that the specimens                        having
these appearances        are indeed pure cultivations         of comma bacilli.
    Ceci and others have described certain spore-like appearances                      in
involution forms, but they           are now regarded as dying or dead              parts
of the rods, such parts staining very slightly or not at all.

     One of the authors of this inquiry found an appearance like that
 of endospore formation in actively growing cultivations in a neutral
 medium, kept for three days at 70° Fahr.
     These are clear, round or oval spots in stained bacilli, one spot in
 each   individual organism of typical shape.        They   are to bo seen also
 in spirilla, and in slowly growing cultivations,             in involution or
 irregularly-shaped forms.       The   appearance    is that seen in tubercle
 and leprosy bacilli,     and usually     associated   with the     presence  of
 spores,   hundreds being seen in a single field.            After forty-eight
 hours' drying, growth took place, but after no longer interval.
     No conclusion   has as yet been arrived at as to the nature of these
 spots, further than that they are not spore appearances.
    For rapid examination of       a fluid   containing the organism, a thin
 film spread    and dried on a cover glass can be stained by a watery
solution of fuchsin in a few seconds, washed with water, and while
 yet wet, explored with an oil immersion twelfth or objective                 of
similar power.
    Part    IL — In forty-four  cases of cholera examined microscopically,
and by plate and tube cultivations, the comma bacillus was found in
 forty.    Of  these thirty  ended   fatally, and in six of these examined
after death the same organism was found.              In   one case examined
by both observers      there were numerous comma           bacilli on the cover
glass    preparations of the stool, but not a single colony could be
found on the plate cultivations, the stools having been mixed with
carbolic acid when collected.       The other three failures occurred with
non-characteristic stools during the early part of the investigation.
    One drop taken from a typical stool during the stage of collapse,
or of the contents of the ileum of a patient who had succumbed
during the same stage, was, with few exceptions, sufficient to furnish
demonstration of the organism by cultivation, and these exceptions
disappeared on the examination of a second               drop.    From   such a
stool, recently passed, colonies were almost always present on the
third   plate, which contained only one-three        or four-thousandth     part
of the original drop.      Later than the collapse      stage, when the stool
or bowel contents were no longer typical, but slimy, fajcal, or even
only opaque, without        being either of the former, the difficulty of
finding the organism was very great, and often         it could not   be found.
The     authors point out that possibly        for this reason     the English

1SS8— S9.]       Messrs Macleod and          Milles   on  Asiatic Cholera.          21
Cholera Commission in Spain frequently failed to                   demonstrate     the
presence        of the comma       bacillus, and    also that   Drs Roy, Graham
Brown, and Sherrington made their examinations after death, when,
it is urged, such examination, alone, is not sufficient to determine
the      absence of the organism in a given case, unless this be supple
mented by failure          to find  it in the typical stools passed during life.
They further        observe    that, unless the cases were under the observa
tion      of the members of the Commission during life, they could not
he      certain that they were dealing       with  the true collapse stage.
       The so-called    "rice-water" stool is almost transparent or only
 slightly opalescent when seen in a glass vessel, having no odour, or
 but a faint meaty smell, and containing white flakes containing
 masses      of epithelium, which, however, are not present in sufficient
 quantity to render the fluid opaque.               This fluid yielded an almost
 pure cultivation      of the comma bacillus by the plate method, whilst
 in   the non-typical     stools several different organisms       were found.
      In typical   cases  it was found that in       the intestinal    follicles and
 in the spaces formed by the separation             of the follicular    epithelium
 from the underlying           membrane      numerous comma         bacilli were to
be demonstrated,          and occasionally a few in the tissues             near  the
 follicles.     Klein has arrived at the conclusion, that if the bacilli
 enter the tissues at all during life, it is only during prolonged
agony before death, and not as a result of the proper activity of the
bacillus,     — but  he does not, however, advance         sufficient proof of this
statement.
     The authors found,       on examination of a case in which death took
place ten hours from the apparent onset of the disease (the post
mortem being made half an hour after death), that the small intes
tine was distended and externally was rose-red, the wall having                      a
lax appearance       as  if  paralysed, or   as if it  had been over-distended,
and had not recovered its contractile power.
     The contents were the clear fluid before referred to as the typical
 stool, the ileum being more           particularly distended therewith.         The
 mucous membrane was swollen, its epithelium stripped to a consider
 able extent, and red spots marked the mouths of the follicles.                   On
 microscopic examination these follicles were seen to be, many of them,
 filled    with broken-down         epithelium,    others  with    the   epithelium
 detached from the underlying membrane,               and the epithelium of the

22               Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                    [i
lumen of the intestine was absent               in places.     Comma bacilli        were
present in the follicles and sub-epithelial spaces.
    In  a case of    thirty hours' duration, examined six and            a  half  hours
after death, the small bowel presented               an appearance      like the      ease
just   described,     but was more deeply congested, there being hsemor-
rhages    in  the mucous      membrane.         Comma bacilli were present,             as
in   the last case.
    In  a  third  case, thirty-two hours      ill, examined    two and   a   half hours
after death, the ileum contained            a  thin, slightly blood-stained       fluid,
 not in the least slimy or        foecal,  there   being intense congestion           arid,
 swelling of the mucous lining, with much stripping of the epithelium.
    In  a fourth      case, where death took place on the fourth day                after
 very feeble reaction,      and the stools had become            slimy, dark brown,
 scanty,    very offensive,    and with a slight fecal odour,               the   bowel
 contents    were of the same nature as the stools, but more manifestly
 blood-stained.       Here, stripping of the epithelium, ulceration, haemor
 rhages, and everywhere great             congestion,   were    the features     in the
 small gut.       The comma bacillus, which had been plentiful                   in the
 characteristic stools, was not found in the follicles or bowel contents                   ;
 other organisms       being abundant in the latter.
    So far as the presence of the organism in the tissue of the intes
 tinal wall is concerned,      its relationship to the disease is not thereby
 materially influenced, even if it does not penetrate the tissue of the
 wall in every      case.
     Other organisms        could be demonstrated          in the intestinal          wall
 occasionally,     and in one instance a fungus network had penetrated
 deep into the tissues,     — probably      a post-mortem     intruder.
    The     sections   were loft   in Koch's solution of methylene blue for
 twenty-four hours at the ordinary temperature               of the room.
     Part III. — The authors          then    proceed    to the third      step of the
 investigation.        The search for the comma bacillus in other than
 choleraic conditions of the human body was carried out in six cases
 of diarrhcua, one of dysentery,          specimens    of saliva from four healthy
 subjects, scrapings from three tonsils, one specimen                   of a healthy
 stool, material removed       from the ileum of two cases of phthisis, two
 cases of malignant disease of the stomach, one each of tubercular
  peritonitis and pneumonia, cerebellar              disease, strangulated       hernia,
  cardiac disease, tubercular meningitis, acute bronchitis, and empyema.

la    several    of these,    comma-shaped         organisms   were seen on micro
scopic      examination, but never in any number, and in no single
instance      did cultivations on plates furnish such an organism.                  It
has to be remembered            that this material was subjected         to the same
process of examination             as the cholera material, and also that there
are   few organisms         more easily detected by plate cultivation than the
comma       bacillus. In      a fluid containing comma bacilli alive, examina
tion by plate cultivations will detect them when microscopic examina
tion fails to do so.
     Other bacilli have been advanced from time to time as identical
 with the comma bacillus, but on closer acquaintance their claims
 have been set aside.          Finkler's and Prior's "cholera nostras" bacillus
 and Deneke's " cheese " bacillus             are the only ones that have attracted
 much attention, but their            characters   of identity have also been found
  to be different from those of the comma bacillus, and it is not now
  necessary to particularise them.
      The latest claims of this kind               have   been   put forth by Klein
   (Prartitioner, March 1887, p. 182), who thinks that in two instances
   out of many he has succeeded in cultivating bacilli similar to those
   observed by T. R. Lewis, and which appear " to be in their manner
    of growth, in nutritive         gelatine,   strikingly similar to the choleraic
    comma bacilli."         He   also describes      a bacillus   found in Noma      as
    having similar properties.          The characters given by Klein arc, how
    ever,    not   sufficient to identify       either of these bacilli with that
    described by     Koch
        As regards the relation of the bacillus to the causation                of the
    disease,   it must    be admitted that,      if it is not in  the body before the
    disease    arises,   it must either      enter    the body each time that the
    cholera poison does so, or originate spontaneously in the intestine of
     each case of the disease.           Practically, therefore,    this objection can
     only imply that the comma bacillus is already an inhabitant of the
     human bowel, but that           it requires    the choleraic process to demon
     strate its presence there, since no one has yet succeeded in doing so
     apart   from the disease.         This is    an objection   with not   an atom of
     proof,   unless the following        experiment adduced         by Klein can be
     accepted as such.       It  is stated to be an analogous        condition experi
     mentally produced in an animal.                His own words       are — " That   a
     pathological state of        the intestine has a good deal to do         with  the

In   a monkey which had received the previous                    day a dose     of   castor
oil, and had diarrhoea therefrom, the abdomen was opened under                           the
spray;     a   loop of the lower ileum, just above                the ileo-caecal    valve,
and about         4 to 6 inches        long, was ligatured above and below,            care
being taken not to include in the ligatures the large vessels.                       With,
a   Pravaz syringe             a droplet    of mucus      was   withdrawn      from     the
interior of the loop, and on examination no comma bacilli                            could
with certainty be discovered.                 With another syringe, about          2 ecru,
of  a saturated           solution of magnesium          sulphate    was   injected,    the
loop replaced, and the wound stitched up and dressed antiseptically,
the   whole operation being done                   under the spray.        Immediately
afterwards the animal received subcutaneously                     1 gramme     of chloral
hydrate dissolved in             1  or 2 c.cm. of distilled water            Our animal
was killed after forty-eight hours.                 On post-mortem     examination      the
ligatured loop was found much injected, its cavity filled with, and
distended by,             mucus      containing streaks     of blood and numerous
flakes.      On microscopic examination these flakes contained,                    besides
amorphous          mucus        and detached      epithelial cells, longer or shorter
straight thickish bacilli                     There were present numerous           comma
bacilli,     some        single,    others   in dumb-bells             On microscopic
comparison,         it  was found that they were of the same character as the
choleraic comma bacilli,                except   that perhaps     they looked a trifle
smaller than those in the choleraic mucus flakes.                     Cultivations were
made of them on six gelatine                plates, and in one of these, after three
 days, there        were     no doubt a few colonies which corresponded                with
those    of   the choleraic comma              bacilli ; this was proved       to be the
 case after       two      more    days.    Cultivations    in gelatine    tubes    and in
agar-agar       tubes       yielded growths indistinguishable from the cholera
 comma     bacillus" (Practitioner,            1887, pp. 324-32G).
    In   the     first place, notwithstanding            the  failure to find comma
 bacilli before the pathological state was set up, they are assumed                       to
 be present      ;   secondly,     the material retained in the bowel for two days
between a couple of ligatures               cannot be regarded as representative          of
 the material          flowing so unobstructcdly from the bowel             as  it  does in
 cholera   ;   thirdly,       nothing is said about sterilisation of the needle
 and   syringes,        so that what they might introduce into the bowel                  is

   Klein's experiment by itself, if it proves anything, proves that he
was dealing with an example of spontaneous generation ! Further,
it is not quite clear whether Klein claims that he was dealing with
Koch's       organism,        or only with one identical                as to the characters
given.

M.D. Eilin. — If Koch's comma bacillus be the                                cause of Asiatic
cholera,        the terms     of reproduction of         the disease may be stated thus          :
— There          being no doubt that the organism                   finds conditions favour

there being as little doubt that                    it   must    have found its way there
 alive; and, since Asiatic cholera in                     man    is    capable of recognition
 "by     certain signs, then on pure cultivations of the living comma
 bacillus being introduced into                   the small intestine of      a    lower animal,
 the growth and multiplication of the organism in the small gut must
 be associated        with         the    signs   requisite for the recognition of the
 disease     in   man, but     it        must be proved that these signs themselves
 are not the result of the means by which                           the organism      was intro
 duced into the bowel.
       While the early part of Koch's work                       was    deemed      of sufficient
 importance to be examined into by several British workers,                               and all
 of    these,     with the exception of Drs Koy, Graham Brown,                                and
 Sherrington,        have      practically confirmed Koch's                 facts    up to tho
 point of reproduction                   of the disease in this country,             Klein    and
 Watson Cbeyne alone have experimentally examined Koch's claim
 of having reproduced the disease, as set forth in the Second Berlin
 Congress of 1885, although several have been content                                to criticise.
 Watson Cheyne confirms Koch's results after Nicati and Rietsch's
  method,       and the conclusion drawn therefrom, but does not appear to
 have made experiments after Koch's                           own method.          Klein admits
  that    Koch's bacillus          is     pathogenic to guinea pigs, but opposes the
  conclusion that        it   is   the cause of Asiatic cholera
       At the present time               the general   medical opinion in this country
  as to   the relationship of the comma bacillus to Asiatic cholera may
  be   stated thus   :   though easily identifiable, found as                 a   constant con

comitant of the collapse stage of Asiatic         cholera in Europe, Egypt,
India, &c. ; though it has not been found apart from the disease ;
though it occurs in that part of the body specially affected, — the
intestinal canal, — and disappears from it with the disease ; while it
may be regarded as pathognomic, it has yet to be proved to be the
cause of the disease.
    Many workers have failed to reproduce the disease.              Nicati and
Rietsch, believing that Koch's         organism did not reach the intestine
alive when given by the mouth, opened               the abdominal cavity       of
dogs, and injected cultivations       of the bacillus iuto the duodenum,
both with and without ligation of the bile duct.              Under these con
ditions, they announced that they had reproduced the disease.               Van
 Ermengen, Koch, Watson          Cheyne, and others repeated the experi
 ments   with   the same results,     but the operation was regarded           by
 many as open to strong objection, and more probably the cause                  of
 death than cholera.      The experiment is not free from objection.
    At  the second    Berlin  Congress    in 1885,   Koch announced that he
 had succeeded     in reproducing      the disease    in guinea pigs without
 opening the abdomen.         Finding the reaction of the contents of the
 guinea pig's stomach always strongly acid, he neutralised this
 reaction by injecting into the stomach a solution of soda.             He then
 found that though the organism was thus enabled to pass through
 the stomach alive, no disturbance followed its presence           in the small
 intestine.    Many experiments of this kind failed          ; only one animal
 took sick, and died with signs like those in cholera, and this animal
 had aborted shortly before        the experiment        It was observed,     too,
 that there was some degree           of peritonitis    present as one of the
  results of the abortion.     Koch then     made some experiments, observ
 ing the condition of the animal's digestion, more especially in the
  small intestine, when he found that its contents passed through that
  part of the gut in a very short time.          Coloured foods were seen to
  pass from the stomach      to the  caecum   in a few minutes.      It occurred
  to him that, as in Nicati and Rietech's experiments, the more the
  bowel was handled the more successful they were, and vice                 versa,
  their success might be due to the lessening of the peristaltic action
  of the gut, in consequence        of the handling.       The success in the

1888-89.]       Messrs Macleod and Milles on Asiatic Cholera.                                       27
suggested the same explanation, viz., that the normal peristalsis in
this animal did not afford sufficient time for                          the    multiplication       of
the organisms, so that they and their products might he hurried
through        the small gut before they had multiplied                          to the extent
necessary to set up the changes                     constituting    the disease, and from
the acid reaction of the contents of the caecum they were unable to
multiply and do mischief in that part of the bowel.                                   Recognising
in opium       a drug that would lessen                the peristalsis of the small gut,
he made experiments with                 it,   and finally decided that the injection
of opium tincture into the peritoneal cavity                       was the surest means of
bringing about this                loss of peristalsis, without            otherwise injuring
the animal.             In   this way Koch claims that he has reproduced the
disease,     but his experiments are not as yet regarded in this country
as sufficient, and the objections urged are                  :  —
   1.   The symptoms produced in the guinea pig are not those of
cholera in man, there being no purging, vomiting, or cramps.
   There seems to be little doubt that Pasteur has produced hydro
phobia both in dogs and rabbits by material taken from tbe disease
in man     ;   but there seems to be as little doubt that the symptoms of
that    disease      in   man, the dog, and the rabbit, do not correspond                           in
any two out of the three.                 Is   it   to be expected        that cholera in the
guinea pig will present the same symptoms                           as    in man      ?     Will any
one maintain that              a   given case in man without vomiting, purging,
or cramps  not one of Asiatic cholera
                is                      Such cases are certainly
                                                            1
met with in man, and what    here the exception may be the rule
                                               is
in the guinea pig.
   2.   It     is   objected that death and the post-mortem                           appearances
in the animal experimented with may                       be the result of some other
cause than cholera.
   There       is    some      truth in this objection,            as    animals may die, for
instance, from mechanical injuries with the catheter used to inject
the stomach         ;   from the injection           of fluid into the windpipe               ;   from
needle injuries           in   the abdomen      ;   from an overdose           of opium      ;    from
peritonitis         or septicaemia.       Animals dying from                  these       causes, and
even    those presenting any injury which                       might not have been of
itself sufficient to cause death, have been rejected from the experi
ments recorded below.                   Such accidents might have been passed
over without comment                ;   but in the interest of any one having to

repeat any of the experiments,           it  seems wiser to give the details by
which they and the needless            sacrifice     of animals thereby entailed
may be avoided.
   With    a  careful dissection of the pharynx, the use of an English
No.   3 catheter   without the stilette,        a   wooden gag with a hole in it
for the catheter,      and notched to receive            the upper and lower in
cisors, the avoidance       of force and the exercise of a little patience,
the passage      of the catheter into the stomach of a guinea pig is
attended with       as  little injury   as    its introduction       into the human
bladder in careful hands.            The entrance         of the catheter into the
trachea may be recognised          by the character of the breathing, and
the shorter distance to which           it  passes     without     resistance  as com
pared   with the    oesophagus.      If  fluid be injected into the windpipe,
the animal dies in      a  few minutes.
   Death occurred several         times at first when giving              the dose    of
opium tincture recommended by Koch, viz.,                   1  c.cm. to 200 grammes
of the animal's weight, in which cases the animals never awoke from
the opium sleep.          No   deaths    were      caused     by giving in repeated
doses   1  c.cm. or less of the tincture,            till the animal     was stupefied
sufficiently to lie on the side or back for ten minutes when placed
in that position.        Several times       the dose recommended             by Koch
had to be given, but usually a smaller one sufficed.                       Of  the first
seven    animals     dosed    with    opium       alone,    by means      of a Pravaz
syringe disinfected with corrosive sublimate solution, and that only
before the first injection, two animals died on the afternoon of the
second    day, having been       lively that morning.             These deaths     were
attributed to septicemia, as no special injury could be detected, and
none of fourteen animals          died that were subsequently injected by
means of a Koch's syringe, the needle                of which was heated red in
the Bunsen flame and then allowed to cool before                       each injection,
and the glass sterilised in the hot box.               Koch's is more easily steril
ised than the Pravaz syringe, there being no piston.
   The animal is held on its back in the left palm, the front abdominal
walls being projected forwards and made tense on both sides by the
thumb and fingers,         when    it is    easy    to just enter the peritoneal
cavity with the needle.         An assistant should hold             the animal's fore
and hind quarters.          All vessels   with which the          needle and syringe
 came in contact, as well as all those            that contained laudanum and

  In     all   142 experiments were made.                     Some       of them were carried
out at    the Royal College         of Physicians' New Laboratory for                      Research
in Edinburgh,          but owing to restriction of the number of the experi
ments in       terms of the vivisection            licence,       and delays in extending
or renewing the latter, the rest of the experiments                              were carried out
at the Hygienic Institute of the Berlin University.
   The     organism used was taken from the stools                          of   a case of Asiatic
cholera in Shanghai, October                    1887 ; pure           cultivations   being made
from     plates and fresh gelatine tubes                     being inoculated at intervals
of from        three    to six weeks.           The organism retained its virulence,
killing     guinea pigs in the following                October.
   Thirteen       healthy guinea pigs were killed, and the contents of the
ileum     were examined,       both microscopically and by means of gelatine
cultivations         on   plates.      Normally          the      small     intestine of these
animals        was almost empty and contracted.                           Occasionally      a little
 food could be seen in          it,   but   it   was never distended, as             is   seen after
 an animal has been treated with opium                       as before described,          in which
 case its contents are very similar                 to those of the stomach.                  In no
 instance      was     there   any organism obtained by cultivation                           of the
 materials      taken from the ileum that could be called comma-shaped,
 though        the microscopic            examination          sometimes          furnished    such
 forms     in small numbers,              as well       as    spirilla,     and large,      curved,
 worm-like        bodies, which       latter were            most      numerous in the         caecal
 contents.
    In all     the animals injected with cholera material,                        as well as those
 for control experiments,             5   c.cm.    of   a    5   per cent,       solution of soda
 (XasC03) were injected into the stomach by means of       catheter,                   a
 ten or twenty minutes later  quantity of cholera material or steril
                                            a
 ised    broth, and then the opium tincture was introduced into the
 peritoneal cavity, in the quantity, and with the precautions                                already
 mentioned             The strongly acid reaction of the normal contents of
 the guinea pig's stomach             is    by this means neutralised for six hours,
 the opium prevents too rapid passage of the organism                                 through the
 small intestine, and thus affords opportunity for its multiplication.
 Koch states that alcohol has               a   similar effect on peristaltic movement.
 Klein denies that opium tincture                  lessens intestinal peristalsis.

30            Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                   [suss.
   Four guinea pigs       were injected,      two with tincture of opium and
two with rectified spirit, into the peritoneal cavity, in repeated doses,
till the animals were        sufficiently stupefied to lie on the side when
placed there.       Two   c.cm. of    spirit were     used in   one case, and 2"75
c.cm.   in the other; their weights being respectively 730 and 750
grammes.       They were killed at intervals of from six to nine hours
afterwards, when relaxation of the intestine and arrest of peristaltic
movement were amply demonstrated in all four by distension of the
small intestine with food to a degree never seen in health.                   In the
animals that received        the spirit the stupefaction lasted longer, and
there was increased       vascularity of both peritoneal and pleural serous
membranes,      resembling that present         in the conjunctiva, this vascu
larity   being absent      in the opium-treated animals.               The effect   of
alcohol on vascularity is a well-known               one.    Klein's experiments,
in which he     gave    the opium      in other ways than by the peritoneal
cavity, and then injected the cholera bacillus with negative results,
are inconclusive,      as he never made          a control experiment with         his
material to    see  whether he was able to produce Koch's results under
Koch's conditions.         The well-known         attenuation of virus through
cultivation is left out of consideration, and no details of these thirty
experiments      as  to doses, age of the cultivations,           or conditions     of
administration are given.
    In  seven    cholera experiments, varying quantities of a gelatine
tube cultivation of comma bacilli were added to                5 c.cm.  of sterilised
broth and injected into the animal's stomach.                 In the next twenty-
seven experiments a tube, containing about 5 c.cm. of              slightly alkaline
sterilised broth, was inoculated from a gelatine cultivation of the
bacilli, and incubated at 98° Fahr. for twenty-four or more hours,
and varying       quantities of this were          injected.     Of   these  animals
twenty-one      died,    thirteen     recovered.       The   twenty-ono      animals
recovered    from the effects of the opium, sat up, ran about, and
those   that had small doses of the cholera material, fed.                   On the
following    day they became sick, refused food, the coat stared, the
edges of the eyelids became dry and gummy, and the hind legs were
dragged,   later becoming as       if  paralysed.      Some animals died on the
second day, others on the         third or fourth.
    Of eleven control animals           treated   exactly in the same way, but
receiving sterilised instead of cholera broth, all recovered.

    Three animals, after injection           into the stomach of soda solution
alone, seemed      in no way     affected.
    From    one of the animals that died         after a dose of cholera material,
the small      gut contents      were    collected    in a sterilised vessel, and
injected    in doses of 2     c.cm. into the stomachs of two other animals.
These     two animals died, and          the contents      of their small intestine
were used     in the same way, and          so on  through ten generations.            Of
twenty-one animals thus treated two recovered, nineteen died.                        The
dose    varied from 0-5      to 2-5 c.cm.
     As control experiments to these, two animals received 5 c.cm. of
 the soda solution, 5 c.cm. of sterilised hroth, and thereafter the usual
 dose of opium tincture.          After six hours these animals were killed,
 and the     contents of their small       intestine   collected and injected with
 the same precautions         in doses of   2 c.cm.     Four animals thus treated
  all recovered.
      These   results with bowel        contents     dispose    of Klein's objection
  that the action of      " a chemical    poison present      in  certain cultivations
  of the cholera comma bacillus," is necessary to kill guinea pigs, since
  no cultivations were used.
       The  csecum of the cholera-infected         animals    was usually distended
   with watery, and if the animal died early,                greenish    contents,    and
   contained comma bacilli in great numbers,                 among     a multitude      of
   other forms.       From an animal where this was the                case,   2 c.cm.  of
   the contents of the ileum were injected into the stomach                       of one
   animal, and a similar quantity of the contents of the                   caecum    into
   that of each of the three others.           The former died       ; the three latter
   recovered    without a sign of sickness.          Unfortunately no plate culti
   vations were made of those coecal contents              to ascertain whether the
    comma     bacilli  seen there were capable of growth like those of the
    ileum.    Koch's contention that these organisms                are killed     in the
    Ciecum of these animals is so far borne out by these three experi
    ments.
        Of the fifteen animals that     recovered after injection of the cholera
    material, seven     were   manifestly sick, two were slightly            so, and   six
     were not apparently affected.
        At the present time     even Koch's most energetic opponent               (Klein)
     will allow that   the proof of Asiatic cholera       in  man is the presence of
     the comma bacillus either       in  the stools of a person taken suddenly

 purging, in the contents of the more or less distended, congested,
 rose-red, and paralysed-looking small intestine             ; these contents      being
 watery,   and containing white flakes.
     If these appearances      were present     in man after having been dosed
 with a pure cultivation of comma bacilli,                in a country where no
 cholera was about,       would they not be accepted as proof of the pre
 sence of Asiatic cholera, even         if that   man    had swallowed a dose           of
 soda solution, and had         received    a dose of opium tincture            into   his
 peritoneal cavity     1

 comma     bacilli, and     death    following,    as described,       the   blood was
 fluid, thicker and darker than natural             ; the tissues     of the thoracic
 and abdominal walls were markedly dry; the small intestine was
 throughout distended, congested, and paralysed-looking, and occupied
 a much    larger proportion of the abdominal cavity than usual.                      The
 caecum    was   distended     with    fluid  or semi-fluid      contents.        If   the
 animal had died early, the fluid was not quite clear in the small gut,
 there   being  present     traces of food    ;  still  the watery character          was
very manifest, and mucous flakes were abundant.                   If  the auimal      had
 died on the second or third day, no food remains were to be seen,
and the fluid     in  the small gut the counterpart of the typical cholera
stool of man.        In either    case the comma        bacilli were demonstrated
microscopically, and by cultivation,          as  in man.       While     the organism
in   the broth injected could be frequently counted                  in  a  microscopic
field, in a drop of the small bowel contents               from an animal having
received such      broth the bacilli might be so numerous that counting
them without       dilution of the fluid examined           was an impossibility.
On floating the bowel in water, the stripping of the epithelium could
be well demonstrated.           Two animals, not included amongst                  those
already    mentioned,     died on the fifth and eighth days respectively
after injection of cholera         material.     In    them    no trace of comma
bacilli could be found.         From the appearance          of the bowel      it might
be inferred that they had died in the reaction                 stage.      In  one case
(that of death on the eighth day) the intestine was lax, congested,
the epithelial    lining extensively stripped,         and Foyer's patches could

the only one that           had had     loose stools.
      While     2 c.cm.   of the cholera small gut           contents was a deadly dose,
the same        quantity of cholera broth from             the original cultivations was
by no       means so deadly.             This might         be due   either to increased
virulence of the organism after its passage through the animal, or to
the greater        number of bacilli        present in the one than the other.          The
organisms were certainly more numerous in the bowel contents than
in the broths injected.                As   plate cultivations were made from the
former, and         broth cultivations grown            from these as nearly as possible
under the same conditions, as to quantity inoculated,                      time and tem
perature        in the incubator,         the following experiments are worthy of
record,      though they        were not made with the intention of comparing
the relative         virulence of the cultivations, and the quantities injected
 are     not very suitable for comparison.                   Broth cultivations     derived
 from the original cultivations                 brought from China, and therefore
 cultivated        in gelatine for      a year after being taken from the human

     It  is objected by Klein and Gibbes "that the strongest                     reason
for not admitting          this kind of bacillar relation           to the disease      is
this, that no bacilli        exist in the        blood    or  any other tissue          of
 patients suffering from cholera" (page 32 of Government Report                         of
 Cholera Investigation in India), ignoring the fact that the first mani
 festations of the disease are in the alimentary canal, and are only
 followed by the general constitutional disturbances, while                  a  marked
 departure from the normal condition is met                with in the small intes
 tine and its contents after death.                 Later, Klein      admits that the
 organism is pathogenic         in guinea     pigs,  though it  acts from the      intes
 tine, and is not found elsewhere {Practitioner,              March 1887, p. 200).
 So that what he applies to animals he will not allow to be applied to
 man.
     Another of Klein's objections runs thus — "               If,   as many    believe,
 the cholera dejecta        per   se  were possessed of infective power, then
 it would     be quite impossible to understand how              it  happens   that the
 attendants,       nurses,  and physicians of cholera patients, these that
 handle the cholera dejecta, the friends and relatives living in the
 same      room,    remain so often exempt" (Practitioner,                April 1887,
  p. 275).
      In  the above passage       replace     "syphilitic" and "discharges" by
  " cholera"     and  " dejecta,"    and the objection supplies its own answer.
      Of  a similar character and weight are his objections based on the
  failure of cholera to spread           in certain districts     into which      it  has
 been introduced, the cessation            of cholera in certain seasons, &c.
                             Summary of Conclusions.
      1.  The comma bacillus of Koch is invariably present, and asso
  ciated with certain      changes,    in the small intestine in       cases of Asiatic
  cholera.
      2.  There is no evidence        to show that     it is a normal inhabitant        of
  the human alimentary canal, and therefore no proof for the assertion
  that it is   a  result of the disease.
      3.  The means used to introduce the comma                    bacillus into, and
  those     used to lessen     the peristalsis of,      the small intestine of the
  guinea pig, cannot be regarded             as causing appearances       like  those of

 isss-39.]     Messrs Macleod and Milles on Asiatic Cholera.                         35
 Asiatic cholera, or as causing the death               of the animal,      far less a
 mortality of over 60 per cent
     4.  Pure cultivations     of the comma bacillus, introduced into the
stomach       under the precautions         described,      are   pathogenic    to  the
guinea pig.
    -5.  Injected with similar       precautions,     the    contents    of the ileum
from those animals killed by injections of pure cultivations of the
bacilli, act     in  the same manner as pure cultivations of that organism.
    6.   The organism multiplies in         the small intestine of the animal,
and there is associated therewith changes similar to those in man in
Asiatic cholera.
     7.  As there     are conditions   which favour the passage alive of the
bacillus through the stomach of the guinea pig, and also conditions
 which favour its multiplication in the small intestine of that animal ;
 so in man, as there cannot be a doubt that the organism finds con
 ditions favourable to its multiplication in his small intestine, it              must
 have found         conditions favourable to its entrance          alive, through, in
 all probability,      the mouth and the stomach.
      8. There is strong evidence,         therefore,    for regarding the comma
  bacillus of Koch as the cause of Asiatic cholera.
  Preliminary Remarks on the Homologies of the Mesen
          teries in Antipatharia and other Anthozoa. By George
          Brook, Lecturer on Comparative Embryology in the University
          of Edinburgh.
                              (Read December    17, 1888.)
      The mesenteries      of many Anthozoa are usually regarded              as being
  arranged     in  pairs, the members of a pair being adjacent            mesenteries.
  The common shore Anemones, belonging to the Hexactinias,                        show
  this arrangement very well.            In   a  typical     case,  the    mouth and
   stomodaeum are elongated,       and the pairs of mesenteries are arranged
  in multiples       of six.  There are six primary pairs passing from the
   body-wall to the stomodaeum,           which are complete;           six secondary
   pairs, which may also reach the stomodaeum             ;  twelve pairs of a third
   series,  which     are not complete    ;  forty-eight incomplete pairs of a
   fuurth    series,   and so on.     Of the primary pairs,            two have     the

36              Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                       [i
longitudinal       muscles    arranged       on different aspects      to   those   of all
the other mesenteries,          whatever may be their number.                  These are
known      as
                " directives," and        are situate one pair at each        end  of     the
long axis of the mouth            ;   on these the retractor muscles         occupy the
outer (interseptal) surfaces            ;   on   all the other pairs the        retractor
muscles are placed on the inner (intraseptal) surfaces.
    In   a  very large number of             cases,   however, it is impossible             to
explain the arrangement             in harmony with this         plan.     In the whole
 of the Alcyonaria,       for instance,      there are eight complete        mesenteries.
 At  one end of the stoniodanim              a  pair of directives occur      having the
 same arrangement          of muscles        as  in Hexactinia:   ;  the   other pair of
directives,     however,    have     the retractor muscles        on the inner    (intra
 septal)   surfaces;    whilst     the intermediate mesenteries            do not    form
 pairs in the usual sense, their muscles not being on adjoining                           or
 opposite     sides,   but on the same side.              This arrangement may be
 explained      simply by stating            that all    the retractor      muscles     are
 situated on the abaxial (ventral) surfaces of the mesenteries.                          In
 Edwardsia        and its allies there is an arrangement which                       does
 not correspond        either with the Alcyonarian             or Hexactinian       type.
 Of   the    eight mesenteries,           two pairs of      "directives" show          the
 Hexactinian        arrangement       ;   the other four       mesenteries     have the
 same     arrangement       of retractor         muscles   as  in   the   corresponding
 mesenteries       of Alcyonaria.           In Cerianthidas the mesenteries are
 numerous — not in multiples of six — and, according to the current
 view, not arranged in pairs.               The musculature of the mesenteries            is
 rudimentary.
     These     four instances       will     serve   to  show   the    variation in the
 arrangement of the mesenteries               in some of the leading groups of the
 Anthozoa.         Many Madreporaria show the Hexactinian                  arrangement,
 but others       again do not.         The Antipatharia       are generally supposed
 to be degenerate, and to have lost                  a  considerable number of the
  mesenteries      present   in their      ancestors, but very little is known con
  cerning the morphology of this group.                    Dr John Murray has very
  kindly    placed    the   " Challenger" collection of Antipatharia in my
  hands for identification,           and     I  have   now been enabled        to make
  sections    of twenty-three species of Antipathida?, including the only
  two which had previously been examined by Lacaze Duthiers and
  G. von Koch.          A careful       comparison      of the number and relative

development        of the    mesenteries    in all these forma       has led me to
believe    that their      arrangement     cannot he explained in accordance
with the current views on the subject. With the exception of two
pairs of directives, the mesenteries do not appear to show the paired
arrangement        usually looked for.        The mouth is usually elongated,
and is supported at each end by a pair of directives.                  The muscula
ture is, however, very imperfectly             developed,    and    I  have   not yet
made ont the position of the retractor muscles.                    In Cladopathes,
n. gen., there are only six mesenteries           present.     Two pairs of direc
tives occupy the extremities of the stomodaeum,                as   in other types,
and two other mesenteries are situated in the transverse axis — that
is to say, at right angles to the long axis of the stomodaeum.                   These
bear the reproductive organs.              These six mesenteries I have termed
 " primary; " all       are of considerable length ; those        in the transverse
 axis are, however, somewhat longer than the others.                  In Antipathes,
 Sic, there      are ten mesenteries    — six primary ones as in Cladopathes,
 and four short         " secondary
                                      "
                                        mesenteries, one on each side of the
 transverse mesenteries.          In Leiopalhes there are twelve mesenteries,
 six primary and six secondary. In horizontal sections passing just
 beneath the mouth, the transverse axis is seen to be occupied by an
 interseptal      space, and not by a mesentery.            On each side of the
  stomodaeum there are six mesenteries,              three on each side of the
  interseptal     space    occupying     the transverse     axis.     A. little lower
  down, however, it is         seen that two mesenteries      bordering the trans
  verse axis, one on each side of the Btomodoaum, become lost, and as
  they do      so the other two become more important and approach the
  middle of the      stomodaeum so as to occupy the transverse axis.               The
   arrangement is then as in Antipathes.
      It appears    to me that this arrangement receives its explanation by
   a comparison     with the order in which the first twelve              mesenteries
   are developed in HexactinisB according to LacazeDuthiers.                In Actinia
   and Hdiactis the first twelve            mesenteries    are developed       in pairs
   which    are not adjoining      mesenteries,    but are situated one on each
   side of   the stomodaeum.        The order in which they are developed in
    Beliactis bellis (and in Actinia equina ?) precisely corresponds with
    their relative length in Leiopathes. The first pair to be developed
    are  those    corresponding      to   the  transverse mesenteries         in Anti-
    pathidae; next follow        the   two pairs of directives, and afterwards

  38           Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh..                         \j
 the   three  pairs which     I  have     termed     secondary     in Antipathidae.
 The shortest mesenteries        in Leiopathes are the last of the             six pairs
 to be    developed    in Heliactis.        Evidently,     then,    the    mesenteries
 forming    a pair are originally opposite mesenteries,            and not     adjacent
 ones.    We thus     have  in forms    with an elongated stomodaeum a true
 bilateral symmetry.       The two       pairs of directives limit an anterior
 and a posterior unpaired chamber.              Between these two the             c«?len-
 teron may be imperfectly divided            into any number of paired            lateral
 chambers.      On this interpretation         the arrangement        in   Alcyonaria,
 Edwardsia?,    Cerianthida?,    Madracis, &c, is also easily understood                     ;
 all are modifications of one plan.
    In  the Hexactinue the simple bilateralism is masked, but a                   careful
 study of the order in which           the mesenteries      are   developed shows
 clearly how this is brought about.             In all  types    the mesenteries          of
 a pair are originally    on opposite     sides of the stomodaeum.             The    two
 pairs of "directives" come to be adjacent mesenteries,                for the reason
 that no new mesenteries are ever formed between them, and with a
 further development of mesenteries             they come to be pushed closer
 together.    As is clearly seen from Hertwig's figures of the embryonic
 condition in Peachia, the other so-called " pairs of primary mesen
                                                               "
teries are not pairs developmentally, as they consist of mesenteries
 of different  ages.    They are called        pairs because they are arranged
in couples, having the retractor muscles on their inner surfaces.                       In
 Hexactiniae   the further increase in the number of mesenteries                    takes
place in a modified way.          Buds appear which are on opposite sides
 of the stomodieum,      between     existing "pairs," but instead of giving
rise to a single mesentery       as   before, each gives      rise to two     with the
retractor muscles on their inner surfaces.                                            «
    The general plan of development              I  consider to be      as  follows:    —
The mesenteries have        a radiate     arrangement      in forms with        a  round
stomodaeum     ;  this arrangement      becomes bilateral by an elongation of
the stomodamm        in one axis, the sagittal.          In this   case the    anterior
and posterior pairs (directives) come           to consist of adjoining mesen
teries, whilst the intermediate pairs consist of opposite mesenteries.
So long as the folds of the body-wall give rise to only one mesentery
each, the simple bilateral arrangement            is retained,   as  in Cerianthidae
(I  refer to a bilateral arrangement of parts, irrespective of the out
line of the polyp).        In   case   the    mesenterial    rudiments give rise

(after the formation of the first twelve mesenteries) to two mesen
teries instead of one, the H exact inian type is reached.                   In certain
Madreporaria (e.g., Lophohelia,              Mussa,   and   Euphyllia)     the radiate
arrangement         appears never      to be lost.     At any      rate, according to
Fowler and Bourne, there are no mesenteries distinguishable from
the others as " directives," and there is a perfectly radiate sym
metry.
    Such a general plan of development in the Anthozoa is found in
another form,         for instance, in Perijtatits and Verlelsrata.           In Peri-
patus the blastopore becomes elongate, and closes in the centre, but
 its two       extremities     remain open,      as the mouth and anus.           The
 mesoblastic somites         are formed in the region in which the blastopore
  has closed, and these become more numerous as the two extremities
  become more and more separated                  At  present    I   am only able to
  indicate the hearing of these views in outline.                   I hope, however,
  shortly to make a more detailed communication                on the subject.

        The magnificent sections of the Archaean and Palaeozoic rocks
    which are presented on the north-west coast of Scotland, have
    long been known to all British geologists.             They occur principally
    in the counties of Sutherland and Wester              Ross, from Cape Wrath
    on the north to Loch Kishorn on the south.                    They are not less
    striking     in   an artistic,  than they are instructive          in  a scientific
     point of view.       The height     of   the mountains, their abrupt          and
     precipitous     forms,   and  the thinness, or almost          total absence of,
     superficial covering, are characteristics which combine with                great
     variety and richness      of colouring,   to produce    sc«nery which stands

  general    or normal order in that succession                      is exhibited        in many
 of the     finest      hills.      At   the    base     there    is    that peculiar        gneiss,
  which no        geologist who has              ever    seen    it   can     again     mistake —
 sometimes        called     Hornblendic,         from one of its most characteristic
 minerals — sometimes             Laurentian,         from its immense             local  develop
 ment on        the     northern        shores      of   the    St Laurence — -and             more
 recently termed the Archaean,                 from its being the oldest              sedimentary
 deposit     as yet        known       in   the     world.      On     the    top of this       very
 ancient rock — with all the marks and aspect of                       a most     hoar   antiquity
 on its face   — there       rise immense,         but isolated and broken masses                of   a
 deep   chocolate-red           sandstone       supposed       to be of Cambrian              age —
 sometimes       in low hills or sloping promontories, but more generally
 in fine    mountains of very peculiar and very                             steep and      sudden
 outlines — each          separated        from its        nearest       neighbour       by    deep
 glens or arms            of    the   sea,    or    lakes    of fresh water — and              each
 looking     as    if it    had     come     there      by some inexplicable              accident,
seeing     that it bears             no    obvious        relation     to     the    other    rocks
 upon which it sits, or to the general                        aspect of the country out
 of which it rises.              Then, lastly, in some places, but                     not every
 where, on the top of these steep and violent mountain forms —cut
 out,  as   it would         seem, from         some     greater     mass which          has   been
 swept away — we             have a cap or summit composed                      of   a pure   white
quartzite beautifully             stratified — sometimes            grey with lichens and
mosses, but very often also unstained and glittering, like mountains
 whitened       by an        early    fall   of snow.          The     stratification      of this
quartzite is always unconformable with that of the red sandstone
on which        it   lies,   and    as those      mountains are all nearly naked of
vegetation at the top, the difference                       in the       lines of bedding          is
almost    as    conspicuous          to the      eye    as the     difference       in colouring
between     the two rocks.
    The lowest of these three great rock masses, which is the floor
or basement         rock along the whole of the west coast of Sutherland, —
although in Canada it has furnished certain bodies which have been
supposed      to be, and         probably     are,    of organic      origin, — the so-called
Eozoon, — has          not yet in Scotland supplied even a doubtful                         indica
tion of animal or of vegetable                  life.     It  is, so far as yet observed,

 absolutely azoic ; and from the intense mineralisation of its substance
 it    is   not     very   probable that       it will   ever afford      us any glimpse
into the          great secrete connected with the origin of life upon our
planet.
      The enormous mass of red and gritty Cambrian sandstones and
conglomerates which have been deposited upon the upturned edges
of the Archaean gneiss, is in a very different mineral condition.                           I
found in           it  myself,   very lately, some thinly bedded              deposits,    on
which the ripple-mark                of the waters in which it was accumulated
were        as well marked and as fresh, apparently, as the ripple-marks
left upon any of our shores by the tides of yesterday.                        There seems
to have been no important alteration in its mineral constituents
 since       the time when          its sands and gravelly conglomerates                were
 thrown down in seas or lakes having                a bed    of the primeval Archaean
 rocks.          Yet through       thousands of feet        of thickness, until very
  lately, no trace of organic life had been detected                   ;   and even now,
  as    the result of the most careful examination by the Geological
   Survey officers in all the beds of this vast deposit, the indications
   of   life  are not    only few, but exceedingly obscure.
        The     case, however, is very different when we ascend to the highest
   of this triple group of rocks           — when     we go to the top of the red
   sandstone mountains,           and examine,     or even carelessly walk upon the
    white and flaky quartzites which lie upon                 them.       It is impossible
    not to notice the curiously spotted,            or pitted surfaces of the white
    slabs,    which in many places look like nothing so much as the soles
    ot"    a   labourer's     shoe,    covered    with    projecting       hob-nails.     On
    examination,        one finds that these little knobs, or nail-heads,             are the
    projecting       ends or tops of cylindrical rods which penetrate               through
    the whole        substance   of the rock, so that       if  we  lift    one layer, and
    look at the next floor of rock below             it in the bedding,        we can trace
    the repetition       of similar rods    down, — down, — down — from            the very
    top to the very bottom              of the deposit.        The extreme roughness
     which      they sometimes        present   upon the surface         is thus found to
     be due to the       fact that the quartz graining or structure of the rods
     is harder       than the graining        of the intervening spaces, — so that
     this surface       weathers     away the fastest, and the tops of the rods
     stand    out like the nail-heads in the shoe.           But   these rods can often
     be   detected when there          is no such indication        on     the surface.       I

shall never forget my own surprise when                                I    first went to examine a
fresh section of this rock which was not parallel with the                                           bedding,
but across          it,   or perpendicular to          it,   and which being            a   well-protected
surface       in    a      very sheltered         spot,       showed at           a     little distance         a
perfectly smooth and homogeneous                             face of fracture.              It   was   nearly
as pure white as the finest                   loaf-sugar.          Yet when        I      looked closely
into    it,
          I        could distinctly       see       the parallel and              perpendicular         lines
which indicated the rods, or little cylindrical                                  columns which         I    had
seen    projecting on the weathered                        surfaces         on the tops of the          hills.
Again, there are some other conditions                                     in which       these rods        are
especially         conspicuous,     and       this    is     where       the quartzite itself          is   not
white, but more or less stained by the oxide of iron.                                        Not far from

                                    I     was        living       some years ago in              a   shooting
lodge    built      near the foot of      a     precipitous line of crag which stretched
straight up the hill behind the house.                               It    was of     a   dull brown         or
chocolate       colour,       and, for   a     long time,          it      did   not occur to me that
this crag was an escarpment                     of the same quartzite, only differently
coloured.          (   )n finding from its texture that                  it   was so, I     set to work to
find the rods, and           I   very soon found              a   good many, which, to my sur
prise, were pure white — thus presenting                           a     most conspicuous            contrast
with the surrounding rock.                    They were, however, not nearly so numer
ous, although of precisely the same form and character.                                           For many
years there was much doubt and speculation as to the nature and origin
of these rods — whether they were some form of mineral concretion,
or whether they were the marks and                                indications of some organism.
Maeculloch, in his well-known and admirable work on the Geology
and Mineralogy of the Hebrides                         and        adjacent        Coasts, published in
1819, devotes some pages to                     a    careful       and very accurate account of
this quartzite rock, in connection                      with his account of the Island of
Jura,     and       mentions almost             all the           principal       places      in Scotland
where     it   appears, and        where        it    maintains            a   substantial identity of
mineral composition               and     of structure.                  The passage in which he
alludes to             the   appearances         now         under discussion,              is   curious     as
showing how little he regarded                          them        as     at all characteristic, and
how little he thought them capable of any definite explanation.

same      time it is to be remembered, and it seems to have been much
forgotten,       that      Macculloch     and not Mr Peach was the              first dis
coverer of the now famous fossils of Durness and of Eriboll in
Sutherland,       — some      of which     are described    by him as occurring in
quartz       rock, intimately       associated    with   beds   of limestone.        It  is
indeed most singular that an interval of thirty-five years should have
been allowed, to elapse between the publication of Macculloch's work
and the rediscovery of those fossils in the Durness limestones                     by  Mr
Peach — because not only had Macculloch detected in the associated
beds of Loch Eriboll certain definite organisms which he conjectured
to be fragments of an Orthoceratite, — not only had he recognised
those beds to be the same as those at Durness, — but he had also
 observed that the            calcareous    beds of Durness        presented    on their
                  surfaces "
                                                                "
 weathered                      a variety of singular forms        which he suspected
  to be     of organic origin, and          he had expressly indicated        the prob
  ability that a further search in the same beds, which it was impossible
  for him to conduct in a cursory visit, would in all probability reveal
   more abundant organic remains.f                  It is in connection with this
   early discovery of such remains by Macculloch at Durness that he
   mentions      " vermicular forms       "
                                             as observable   in the base of the lime
   stones, and says they are very similar to similar forms l'ouud in the
   Devonian Marbles at Babbicombe, near Torquay.                         The " conical
    bodies"     which Macculloch         discovered    in the quartz-rock of Loch
    Eriboll have      been since assigned to that class of Annelids which live
    in  calcareous    tubes, and Macculloch's        name has been most properly
    associated    with   the peculiar species which he discovered.              The bed
    of quartzite is now known           as   the  " Serpulite Grit."       It  has been
    identified in other places in Sutherland, and is of great value in the
    detailed work of the Geological Survey in that most difficult section
    of country.
       It   was, however, perfectly natural that Macculloch                should have
    laid little    stress,   or should have altogether failed to notice,               the
    extraordinary abundance of the rod-like bodies                in  the quartzite of
    Sutherland and Ross, because the special              area of his investigation
    was   the Islands, and not the Mainland,            of the north-western coast

Durness, — an island hardly belonging              to the Hebridean group at all,
and really a mere fragment of the Sutherland Mainland, that he                       was
led to observe the fossiliferous strata at Durness and EribolL*                    And
here we come upon the curious fact, that although quartzite                    rocks of
great   thickness occur far to the south of the                remarkable develop
ments    of it in Sutherland and Ross-shire,             and   although Macculloch
did not fail to identify it elsewhere         as  the same rock, both mineralogi-
cally and stratigraphically, yet out of the classical region where                  it  is
so  conspicuous it      cerises altogether to exhibit the same rod-like          bodies
                                 " which Macculloch did observe at one
and "vermicular          forms                                                    spot,
and of which        he spoke      so  doubtfully.       It  has long now been        the
accepted interpretation by all geologists             that these bodies      represent
the tubes     or burrows        made   by marine worms of many species                 in
the intertidal zone of shores of the sea.               This interpretation is not
 without    its difficulties      of detail.     We are all familiar with the
appearance      of worm-castings         on our sandy and             muddy shores        ;
and more attentive observers            must have sometimes           been   surprised
by the immense         numbers of these burrowing annelids in particular
areas.    But    the natural supposition would seem to be that although
each one of these worms must make a tube                  in the sand or   in the mud
in which it feeds and burrows, yet these tubes must                  be as evanescent
as the passage        of   the annelid, because the pressure of wet sand              on
its own particles, or the transferring and transfusing effects of water
permeating its substance, would seem to be causes sure to effect a
 rapid obliteration of any temporary vacuity made by the passage of
 the worm.       Still it    is certain that internal tubes and passages must
 be made by such worms in the course of their ceaseless operations,
 and that they must be made            in  enormous        numbers when the sand
 or the mud, or       a   combination of both, is sufficiently charged             with
 organic matter, to support the annelids in such abundance as we
 constantly    see   upon the shore.         It  is perfectly natural,       therefore,
that upon primeval shores on which fine sand was constantly being
 formed and deposited during periods of time which                      were   more   or
 less prolonged, worms should have burrowed as they burrow now,                        if
 this form of organic life had been at that time established.                       The

only difficulty is to understand the conditions under which these
old burrows were so stable as to be capable of preservation when the
sandy mud was in course of solidification, and when in many cases
it must have been placed under the great pressure of later deposits.
This is one of tbese difficulties which are felt instinctively even by
those who do not consciously reason upon                           it,   and   it   is   not surpris
ing that it should have long delayed the full acceptance of the
annelid interpretation of rod-like bodies in    very hard and very   a
ancient rock.     do not think that the difficulty of following the
                      I
modus operandi               in      the      preservation     of these        assumed         annelid
burrows has been altogether removed.                           But undoubtedly               some facts
connected  with the peculiar structure and functions of the skins of
annelids tend to diminish the difficulty in great degree. We now a
know that, by virtue of power to secrete and exude very glutinous
                                        a                                       a
slime, some marine worms which do not burrow at all, do neverthe
less   make for themselves tubes of                   sand grains agglutinated together
 into a texture            so firm that they are capable             of very        great     resisting
 power.        The       congeners       of   these worms are      in many          cases creatures
 which are themselves naked, but are protected by always burrowing
 under ground.  These are said to have, though in    less degree, the          a
 same       power of secreting an agglutinating slime,                         so that in every
 tube which they dig out, or along which they pass, or in which
 they may Ue, they make and leave behind them an internal wall,
  or caked surface, which has  certain coherence — just enough to
                                                 a
  constitute    a     definite mechanical difference              between       these tubes and
  the surrounding             matrix.         This   is   perfectly intelligible.             But   it   is
  less easy to see how these                  tubes could come to be filled up by the
  surrounding sand, and yet without obliterating the impression of the
  walls.       It   seems as       if   the interior of the tube could only be filled
  by the destruction               of its walls — unless indeed,            we are to suppose
  that sand         of   some other texture, not agglutinated by slime, and                          not
  discoloured by contact with organic matter, had somehow come to
  be      introduced       into the tube from the top or surface                         or external
  aperture, and so forced down all its length as to take                                 a   cast of     it
   along    all its      course.  This really would seem                 to be the only process
   by   which we can          explain those cases in which               the matrix       is   coloured
   red,   and the tube converted into                a    rod of pure white quartz                  rock.
  It   is   not very easy to follow in detail the natural process by which

this result lias been accomplished, although perhaps it is not more
inconceivable         that     a    good     many         other cases              in which            organic
structure itself of the most delicate kind has been wholly converted
into, and reproduced               in, the mineral substances                      of lime and silex-
There     is    one    process        which        has        sometimes           suggested         itself     to
me, although this also                is besot with            many difficulties.                It    is con
ceivable that         a sandy      sea     beach, well bored by annelid tubes,                               may
have been lifted above the sea-level by some earth movement.                                              That
all marine      deposits       now converted into rock have been so lifted at
some time or other is certain.                      Such movements,                 involving only a
very few feet of elevation, may have been sudden, and would be
quite sufficient.         It   is conceivable that the open ends of the tubes
might be thus exposed                     to desiccation, and to the penetration of
blowing sand in a dry condition, or possibly of sand carried into
them by floods of fresh water.                      In either way, it              is conceivable that
the tubes       may thus have been rilled with grains of sand capable                                          of
retaining their special              colouring and texture under all the subse
quent changes to which they, together with the surrounding matrix,
were exposed in being hardened                      into rock.
     But here we come upon another fact which seems to justify all
our difficulties — in proving that only under conditions very excep
tional indeed was it possible for such tubes to be preserved.                                                 In
all parts      of Scotland where              this quartzite rock appears, except                             in
Sutherland and Wester Ross,                        the annelid tubes                have     either been
wholly obliterated, or             else    they have never existed.                    This last         alter
native is highly improbable.                   There is good stratigraphical evidence
that the quartzite rock which appears elsewhere                               to the south belongs
to the same horizon in geological                    time, and must have been accumu
lated under similar conditions.                      In        the island of         Jura,     mountains
of 3000 feet of elevation are entirely composed                                    of it from top             to
bottom.        In Islay      also, the same rock reappears,                        and with           more of
its characteristic whiteness                 than        in    Jura.         The     same      strata        are
prolonged towards the north-west in the line of the Great Glen,
or   of   the    Caledonian               Canal.     A string of small                     islets      on the
eastern     side of Lismore are composed                         of    it,   in    close proximity to
other islets of limestone             against which they are faulted in                        a      position
of extreme unconformability.                       The bed which they represent                         passes
straight on under the hills of Ballichulish,                            near which          it   has been

quarried and exported for uses connected                    with    potteries    in England.
To the north of             Ballichulish,      again,   it  rises    to the summit of a
high mountain            in the    ranges which terminate in Ben Nevis.                   This
quartzite ridge          not being      the one nearest        the shores of the Linneh
Loch, but          a ridge behind, is concealed               from the eye in passing
from Oban to             Fort William.         But it is visible from the              passage
between Listnore             and the Morven         shore.       I  never observed        it  at
all until the present               year,    when the illumination             of a setting
sun,      and     the foil of        a   dark cloud behind, revealed               some    high
and      jagged peaks of a pure white, recalling the special scenery
of     Loch Torridon, of Loch Assynt, and Loch Maree.                                  Now in
all these southern             masses     of quartzite,    so far as     I   have examined
 them myself, and so far as                  I  know from others,           no vestige       has
 been      seen    of the annelid rods          or presumed         tubes   of    the western
 quartiite.         In    three places       I  have   had special         opportunities of
  observing it.         First, on the      western side of the island of          Jura,  where
  an extensive        series   of raised     beaches, too     little known      to geologists,
  have      collected     together an immense           assemblage       of the rolled and
  weathered fragments of the quartzite, and where, from its reddish
  colour, any white worm tubes such as                 I   have referred       to in similar
   rocks in Sutherland, would             be specially conspicuous; secondly, on two
   of the islets of white quartzite which belong to my own property in
   Lismore, and which          I have     examined with some care           ; and    lastly, on
   the prolongation         of the    same beds south of Ballichulish,               at a spot
    where     the rock has been worked and quarried for commercial                         uses.
    In all   these    places, so far as      I could  see,   no annelid tubes are to be
    seen.      It  looks as     if they had      been squeezed        out under enormous
    pressure, or obliterated by some other of the unknown causes which
    seem to     have had the same effect in many other cases of strata once
    fall of the remains of organic life.
        I now     come    to the special subject of my communication to the
     Society to-day.        It   was the result of a fresh            visit  made this last
     autumn to the wonderful escarpment sections of Western Ross, in Loch
     Torridon and Loch Kishorn, that               I was     led to think over and over
     again whether a closer search might not reveal a survival elsewhere of
     the  organic remains of the quartzite.         It was     the well-known generalisa
     tion  of Murchison,       from the section of country across the county of
     Sutherland from east to west, that the great mass of mica-schists, and

48            Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                  [i
more recent      gneisses,   which constitute the bulk of the         Highlands
from Loch Eriboll to the Firth of Clyde, represent the              same strata,
which lie between the chocolate-red Cambrian sandstones of the west
coast, and the Old Ked Sandstones on the eastern side, of that county.
The rediscovery by Peach of the fossil remains so long before detected
and indicated by Macculloch, enabled Murchison to present this
generalisation      as  firmly resting both        on stratigraphical    and       on
paheontological evidence.           I    have never seen the least     reason to
suppose that the late marvellous discoveries           of the Geological Survey
in Sutherland cast the least doubt on Murchison's general            conclusion.
 Those discoveries, indeed, are of immense interest, and teach us
 many lessons on the dynamics of geology — lessons, I think, which
 were greatly needed.         But it does seem to me that the bearing of
 these discoveries on the conclusions of Murchison is almost nil.
 They prove      indeed    that, in    a  middle region between     the  extreme
 west   and the extreme        east, there has been local disturbance       of    an
 extraordinary kind, and that in that region the present order          of super
 position cannot be taken         as   determining the geological age of the
 rocks, owing to reversing and overlapping faults — " thrust-planes,"
 and other phenomena         of earth movements      so peculiar that they seem
 to have already called forth a completely new               nomenclature as re
 quisite to describe them.         It   is a curious fact that Macculloch,   with
 a  penetrating and almost prophetic eye, seems to have suspected
  this area of country to be one of unusual disturbance.           He speaks of
  " two distinct
                   deposits of gneiss, of which one is placed in a reverse
 position to the other."       He speaks of " essential disturbances among
 the primary rocks," due to         "one    or more revolutions," separated     by
 " long intervals of time."           He speaks of " the science of geology
 being not yet sufficiently advanced" to afford any complete explana
 tion of the peculiar phenomena             of that region.*    All this sounds
 like a dim prevision of the wonderful inversions of the natural order
 of the rocks in that part of Sutherland, due to most " revolution
  ary" movements       of subterranean force, which have only just been
  discovered   and laboriously traced by the Geological Survey.          Nothing
  but such   a mapping and tracing of every bed in the greatest             detail
  could have unravelled such          inversions, conversions, distortions, and
 horizontal displacements.          Murchison did not know of these, and        he

pected       it   would be found, leave no doubt of the Lower Silurian                                         age
of    the    great mass          of strata overlying the Cambrian sandstones and
the     white quartzite                 on the west, and presumably underlying                                 the
Old Red upon the east.
     The result of this conviction                       as   to the substantial truth of Murchi-
son's       generalisation,              has led me to anticipate with                        some     hopeful
expectation the discovery of organic remains,                                    some day, among the
metamorphic              rocks of Argyllshire                 as belonging to the Lower Silurian
series.         With this view,                 I   have       often    carefully examined             the cal
careous beds            which        are abundant there, but always hitherto without
result.        Impressed, however, with the specially fossiliferous character,
as regards            annelids at least, of the sandstone or quartzite deposits in
the north,        I      determined on my return home, in September                                        last, to
 examine carefully                  a   few beds of that rock which                  I   had long known
 to occur close           to my own residence at Inveraray.                             Those beds form
 no noticeable            feature in the country.                  They make no show upon the
 tills, nor are they conspicuous on the shores.                                      Crystalline quartz          is
 indeed        abundant —in                veins and in masses.                  Thin         beds or bands
 among          the mica-slates,                which are more or less silicious, are also
 abundant.             But true quartzite, well stratified                    and bedded,       is   very rare,
 so tare       that  I    know of          it   as occurring only at two spots on the shores
 of
        Upper         Loch Fyne.            Close to the town of Inveraray there                              is
                                                                                                              a
 little       headland           or promontory,                called        Craig-na-churach,              which
 exhibits       a     series    of true quartzite beds, that may be from 30 to 40
  feet      thick.      It   has been       a    good deal quarried and used for making
  breast      walls against the                  sea.   I      had also frequently examined                     it
  for metallic           ore, since galena              is   present    in    detached        spots through
  out some           of the beds.          I     had also observed              some strange            cavities
  m    it    filled     with        sand    or clay           coloured with            iron    oxide.         But
 nothing          had        ever       suggested        itself   to me         as    indicating           organic
 remains.      I       knew, however, that the same quartzite, although in very

inferior    mass,    did   reappear     a few miles to         the  east  of Inveraray,
upon     the    same   northern      shore     of Loch Fyne,         and to this      bed
accordingly my first search was directed.                 That search led me at first
into a mistake as to certain appearances                  — a mistake not without
instruction on      the danger of preconceptions in the interpretation of
obscure      phenomena.         I   found      on the      surface,   and apparently
 embedded      in the grain of the       stone, certain ramifying filaments           and
 minute tubes in red oxide of iron, together with certain knots which
 Beemed at first sight to be the seed capsules                   of some plant.       On
 breaking up the rock         I found     interspersed throughout its substance
 certain discoloured spots, which almost invariably took the form                      of
ovate or spatulate rings,        all more or less     like the form of     a battledore,
but without       any appearance       of a stalk or handle to the battledore.
 Connecting       these internal      oval rings with the external forms               of
 vegetable     structure preserved         in  casts of red oxide of iron,         I was
 inclined to believe that they were the same in origin, and that the
 more distinct character of the forms on the surface                  was due to     that
 effect of weathering         which so often reveals            organic remains     upon
 the surface      of rocks when no such forms can be detected                     in the
 fresh fracture.        In   pursuit of       this idea,    I   had the rock opened
 and split     at various points of the outcrop of the beds                ; and every
 where    I   found,   sometimes       thickly interspersed,         sometimes     thinly
 scattered,    oval   stains and spots, and some lines, which were all
apparently referable to the same ultimate cause and source, whatever
 that might be.        At   one place these small ovate           stains passed out    of
 the quartzite altogether, and were repeated in some finely laminated
overlying beds of pure micaceous                 schist.    This, however, occurred
only where such schists lay in immediate contact with the quartzite
 — an observation which is important,                 because the total absence        of
them in the great masses of overlying                    schists and schistose       com
 binations     which     constitute     the bulk of         our hills,   is one of the
features    in the   case.     The occurrence        of the oval rings and other
discoloured impressions, which forms the subject of this paper, is,
so far as    I  have yet seen, strictly confined to the quartzite beds, and
to a few inches of very fissile mica slate which lies in immediate
contact with that rock.
    Two specimens,        or sets of specimens,        and these alone, contributed
 for some little time longer to carry on my impression that they

might be due to vegetable                 rather than to animal life.                   The main
objection and difficulty was that the ovate or capsule-like rings were
almost always unconnected with any stalk or stem.                                One specimen,
however, had an appearance                      of being so connected,          whilst another
suggested tbe idea of straight linear stalks like those of some kinds
of       reed.     There    was yet one other specimen              that caught my eye for
a    moment among a great number of fragments,                         which      I   saw at once
was       in itself    the most distinct and definite form of all, but which, as
not suiting tbe interpretation which was then preoccupying my mind,
and as not suggesting any other,                      I   did not pick up or preserve at
the time.            This   now turns out to be one of the mostinstructive of
all, andit          has fortunately been preserved — only because the recol
lection of it          came     back to my memory                 after some days, and on
revisiting the          spot   I found    it,   and have brought        it    here to-day.
         At   my    invitation,    the place was           visited first by Mr           Hill,     the
officer       of   the Geological Survey, who              is    now employed in mapping
the strata towards the                lower end of Loch Fyne              ;   and at     a     subse
quent date            by my distinguished             friend,     Dr Geikie,      the Director-
General of the Survey, who very kindly came to Inveraray for the
purpose of examining the rock.                      Both of these gentlemen doubted,                as
they well might, my idea that they were of vegetable                                  origin   ;   and
both, as the alternative, ascribed                   them to mineral concretions, such
    as    pyrites, or clay balls, drawn out into ovate and linear forms by
the effect of shearing or slipping movements                        of the strata over each
    other.
         Several features      in these ring-like and oval stains, as well                as some
    arguments derived from other considerations, impressed                         me with the
    belief that this afforded         no satisfactory solution of the problem.                     In
    the first place,      the idea of    little balls of clay having           been formed in
    immense numbers on            a   sandy shore, and of their having been again
    and again      re-formed so as to be buried in every layer of the deposit,
    seemed to be      a   purely theoretical idea, and not            a   little fanciful.         In
    the second       place, such balls would not afford, even                   when      sheared
    and flattened,     the tube-like sections in the form of oval-rings which
    have to be accounted          for.    In    the third       place, mineral concretions,
    and    especially sulphides of iron in many forms, are very common
    throughout      all our other     rocks, and yet        in   none of these have similar
    appearances      been   produced.          In   the fourth      place, there are certain

very definite features           about these bodies which are quite              constant
and   which      it   is  not    easy to conceive        could   be   constant      on      th<
hypothesis of       a  purely mineral origin.
    Under      these circumstances,         I  sent a series     of the   specimens to
Mr Etheridge,        the skilled palaeontologist         of the British Museum, for
his opinion and determination.                  He at    once pronounced decidedly
against    my preconception of a vegetable                 origin.     After   the most
careful and prolonged examination, however,                        with all    the      light
which could be thrown upon the question by specimens                            from all
parts   of the world,           Mr Etheridge        has   come    to the     conclusion,
without      the    smallest     doubt, that the bodies found in the                  Loch
Fyne quartzite are the tubes or burrows of annelids,                          similar in
their nature and origin to those which have been long                         familar in
the same rock as          it   occurs  in Sutherland        and   Ross.    This verdict
was supported by arguments,                by specimens, and by further           investi
gations on the spot, which have carried complete                      conviction   to my
own mind that          I was entirely led ofF the true scent when             I thought
of vegetable       organisms,      and that, although in a somewhat             new and
certainly unexpected            form,   I   had, after all, found what          was the
original object        of my search, namely, the repetition in our south
western beds of quartzite of those remarkable annelid borings                      which
are so   abundant in the north.              One specimen from the          quartzite of
Quenaig,      in Sutherland, was almost of itself sufficient to satisfy me
that Mr Etheridge had recognised                  the true interpretation.         It   ex
hibited   a cross section       of the well-known annelid tubes of that county
in a fresh fracture of the rock          ;  and these cross sections presented        pre
cisely the same ovate            tubes, with precisely the same defining             ring
of red oxide of iron.            The phenomena arc identical.             But the inter
pretation is confirmed by many other facts, and converging considera
tions.      I will     now    shortly sum up the arguments              which seem to
me to be tolerably conclusive on this matter.                     I  give them in the
order in which they range themselves                    in my own mind — without
laying any stress upon the authority of Mr Etheridge — although, in
 passing,     I  may     say that in questions such              as  this, namely,     the
interpretation         of appearances        which     are   of necessity     obscure,    I
 attach    immense       importance       to   the perceptions      of a trained and
 experienced       eye.      It  acquires    an education,      and an insight of its
 own.     Interpretation becomes almost instinctive, from that kind of

**   correlation," which is the highest of all, namely, the adjustment
of out perceptive faculties to the indications of external nature.
       In   the first place, then, we must hear in mind the nature of the
animals whose            traces are in question.        They are animals absolutely
 wanting both in external and in internal skeleton.                        Nothing that
 constitutes           in most other animals           the   fossilisable   elements of
  structure,        has any existence in them.             Soft animals, which have
  a    shell, themselves          decay,  but their shells remain,       and   thousands
  of extinct mollusca belonging to the past ages of organic life are in
  this       way    preserved      to us with the utmost minuteness            of detail.
  In thi3       very rock, as it occurs in Sutherland, the serpulites discovered
  by Macculloch             represent,    in a silicified   condition, the calcareous
  shells of        some species of annelid, which lived, as some species now
  do,      in  an external shelly tube.           But  large  classes of other marine
  worms or          annelid's have no such shells.        They are entirely composed
  of tissues extremely soft, liable             to rapid corruption after death, and
 incapable of being fossilised,             except in the form of mere casts.
        On     the other hand, we have to recollect that these naked                   an
 nelids perform a work in the soft material of future rocks which
 is altogether peculiar to themselves — a work which arises out of
 their        relation to peculiar sources of food, and for the performance
  of which they            are endowed       with very special     and very wonderful
  powers.           It is their function to bore into, or           perforate,  all kinds
   of marine sediment, both those which are in                    course of being laid
   down, and         those even,     in many   cases, which have been long indurated
    into the hardest          rocks.     Confining our attention to those species of
    naked annelids which burrow in soft sands, clays, or mud, we find
     that there are many different genera which affect different kinds of
     sediment, and make burrows with some characteristic differences.
      Some     line their    tubes or tunnels with calcareous         matters which are
      in the nature of       a  shell, and might be preserved like any other shell.
      But this is not the        case  with those annelids which are most common
       and abundant upon our existing shores.                At every     ebb tide upon
        our coasts,   where there is sand or clay or mud, we see the surface
        covered   with worm castings, and the presumption is that these are
        the living   representatives of the primeval annelids which performed
         the same   work in     the earliest ages of which       we have any record in
         the rocks.

     Looking then to these, as presenting all the facts upon                    whjcli        n
  must     argue    in interpreting       the past,    we   find that our        foreshoi
  annelids are of many kinds                 anil  sizes,  from one species             whie
 attains the great            proportions indicated by         a  length of 3         feet t
 other species which are very small.                  We find that the        coin in ones
 varieties     which      leave    their  marks at      low tide on almost              even
 possible     spot of shore, bore and tunnel           into the wet sands        arid mud
 with      almost     incredible     ease   and facility      of motion.        Professor
 Mackintosh, who,           as  must be well known          to the members          of tbis
 Society, has made a special                study of these organisms,          speaks of
 them     a3

                               through open water and through wet sand                  with
 almost      equal ease.*         He tells    us that these perforations         are very
 various in direction and in shape; that the animal secretes                      from its
 skin   a fine   lubricating slime, which must always have                a  tendency to
 agglutinate the grains of sand that come into contact                      with it, and
 which in some species is employed                to construct a tubular       case     thai
 projects from the surface of the sand, and constitutes a sort of house
 or   fortress    from which the creature            protrudes its tentacles        or its
 proboscis     for the seizure of its food.           But the food of the common
 burrowing sand worms is found in the sand itself, and the agglutin
 ating power of their slime on the surrounding                  particles   of sand may
 have no other effect than that of so hardening or indurating the                    inner
 surface of the tubes as to render them comparatively lasting, or,                        at
 all events, to prevent their speedy obliteration.                  Here    we  have one
 obvious explanation of the possibility of fossilisation, or of permanent
 endurance       through the processes which convert soft sediments into
hardened       rocks.      And then, again, we find that another step forward
in our investigation of existing facts becomes an important step for
 ward also in our interpretation of the past.                We know that the pur
pose or aim of burrowing worms, in the exercise of their extraordinary
muscular energy in boring, is to extract food from the substance, what
ever    it may be,      in which they burrow.          We know further, that this
food is extracted by the power which the worm has of swallowing the
finer particles of its surrounding medium, of passing                    them through
the whole length of its body, of submitting them there to its digestive
apparatus,      and of discharging behind it all the mere mineral particles

which hare been            stripped of nutriment.           In this    respect the marine
worms       perform the same            work that on land is done by the earth
worm.         It would        seem to follow from this process that one con
sequence        of   it is likely     to be that, as the worm passes through the
sand, the        finer    grains within reach of its swallowing power will
be   segregated        from the coarser, and be concentrated in what are so
well known           as the     " castings," most of which are ejected                 on the
surface,     but some         of which       may very probably remain in portions
of    the    burrow.         And     now      we   reach   a further      fact of curious
significance         and    interest.      "We know      that all organic matter has
more      or less the property of decomposing                 the   mineral compounds
 of iron,      and of reducing them to red oxides.                     What,    then, is the
 probable        effect upon such particles of iron                as   may     be   ingested
 by the       worms, and pa.-sed through their bodies?                       Have we any
  evidence      on this point from our living annelids 1 Yes, we have. It
  is found,      for example, that when a worm burrows through blue or
  dark coloured          shale, the castings of the worm, which are the debris
   of the mineral, are not of the same colour as the matrix from which
   they come ;        from blue or blackish, they         are converted      into brownish
   or reddish       material.*      On the same principle, and by the operation
    oi tbe, same        causes,   we    see   that the particles of sand which are
    agglutinated by the slime of the annelid, and are converted                          into a
    thin wa\l by the coherence              thus   produced, would probably exhibit
    the same change         of colour due to the peroxidation of any iron present
     in the     surrounding       material.       Hence,   again,    we    are   led    to the
     conclusion that several         characteristics may be expected in any marks
     left in rocks by tbe boring of annelids — first, that the walls may retain
     a special     character   distinguishable      from the matrix        ; secondly,     that
      one  indication of these may probably be some visible development
      of the oxides       of iron, more or less conspicuous according to the
      abundance       or scarcity      of iron in the      matrix    ;  and    thirdly,    that
      wherever the        castings have been left in the tubes,               or have been
      washed into        them again,      they would most probably exhibit some
       AiSewuce     both of texture and of colour as compared with the matrix.
       There   is   another conclusion,        which we may draw assuredly from
       uie series    of causes tbus traced, and that is          a  conclusion     as    to the
       effects which would probably result from the complete breaking up of

the tube       walls, and any dissolving out or excavation                     of the    whole
tube and of its contents, by some subsequent                          exposure     to  solvent-
agencies, such as exposure to sea water, or from mechanical                           violence
deforming, and more or less crushing the tubes out of all distinct
recognition. One lasting effect, it would seem, is likely to remain, and
that is the removal of the liner particles from among the coarser for
some little space round the original path of the worm.                          The effect of
this would be to leave change of texture along that path — a coarser,
                                a
rougher graining in the sand in any slits or hollows along                               which
the original tubing has been made.
    We     have     not yet done, however,            with the lessons to be learned
from    a careful     examination of our liviug annelids.                  Hitherto     I have
been drawing from a few facts reported                    03' others as to the        work of
annelids,      certain conclusions         as   to consequences          which that work
would probably or necessarily             involve.        But   as   I recollected    one day
that   I  was writing       this paper within          "200   yards of abundant shore
worms,      I  determined      to make      some experinieuts and              some    further
observations on what they do.                    The very first thing           I  found was
that, although the orifice             of the tubes       as   they    are opened       on the
surface      are roughly and          irregularly     cylindrical,      yet the slightest
pressure      on    the   sand,   such     as    even a     sharp knife         produces in
carefully cutting off the castings, is sutlicient to draw or deform the
orifice out of its true shape, and to convert                   it into   an oval aperture
or ring, or even         into  a mere     slit.     Further,     I  have    found that the
path of the worms,          although generally vertical for               a   short distance
below the surface, does not generally continue to be vertical, but
soon     becomes      sloping, and often almost or altogether                     horizontal     ;
consequently any section               of the sand is sure to cut the tubes                   at
various angles,         and   therefore      to exhibit them variously as ovals,
or as circular rings, or           as   hollow lines.         In    order    to test    this,  I
have used an expedient which                 has been highly successful.               I have
had a trench          cut    deeply round a group             of worm         castings    until
the block of sand containing them has been isolated like the stump
of   a   tree.      This block      has then       been    undercut horizontally and
lifted out of the shore.            Then carefully opening the orifices of                  the
burrows,       I   have    injected, with        a   syringe,     liquid    plaster-ofq^aris.
The easy          and   complete       passage     of    this    injection      proves     how
completely the path of the worm is kept open by the agglutination of

      its walla;   whilst, on cutting       away the sand, that path becomes
      risible  in  a  solid plaster-of-paris cast.         The combined result of
     those experiments      is to show how worm tubes would be deformed
     by movements       in the bedding of the rocks, sometimes                 producing
     simply a change from circular          to ovate forms, but in the              case  of
    more extensive movements,         leading to flattened and broadened shapes
    and impressions, which must be more or less difficult                  of interpreta
    tion, because    more or less widely divergent from original and undis-
   torted tubing.        Another most interesting result of this examination
   has been      an ocular demonstration          of the fact that the worm path
   is marked by a distinct         development of iron oxide for some little
  distance on every side of the tube.               The sand      in this   case   is much
  mixed with clay, and is of a dark bluish-black                      colour.     A ferru
  ginous band is produced           in this    substance     round the tube.           This
  ferruginous      band varies,     as   we    might expect        it to   do,   in width
 according to the quantity of iron             in  the sand, and according to the
 length of time during            which contact       with    the   animal matter        has
 been maintained.            Means have been found of hardening the sand
 so as to preserve        these instructive specimens,         and    I  now lay before
 the Society several of them, one being             a specimen      in which the worm
 is exposed lying dead in his burrow-tube, and the ferruginous stain
 is     seen  spreading to a very considerable distance                  on either side.
 How this chemical effect results from the proximity of the worm
is an interesting question.             I produce,      also, some other specimens
showing irregularities in the tubes, swellings and contractions, pro
duced apparently by the worm turning                   in its burrow,       and crossing
the path of another worm, or its own, all tending to explain                            how
there       must be many obscure          marks left in rocks in the original
material        of which     such  worms have burrowed.                I  produce     speci
mens also,        which exhibit beautifully the segregation of finer material
along the path of the worm, precisely                as we   should expect from the
functions which that animal fulfils in swallowing and in discharging
the     substances through which it works its way.                   Every anticipation
which can be suggested             by reasoning      and    by inference is found to
be     fulfilled in   the observed    results.
      Standing      then upon this series of facts connected                 with living
annelids,        we have solid       grounds for defining           a  whole group of
characteristics        which must belong            to   the    traces    or remains      of

annelid working                  in   rocks.         In    the      Jird        place,    the tubes           where
exposed       in      transverse        section,          in    undisturbed              material,         will      be
approximately circular.                   In     the       second place,               when they are                cut
across, not at right angles, but obliquely to the path of the                                            worm, the
section    will       be more or less ovate.                        In    the       third     place, the       same
effect    will     be      produced      when the material has been disturbed                                       by
shearing         or     slipping       of the beds              or lamina               of deposit.           Such
movements,            if not violent, will produce                   an elongation or                pulling       out
of the cross section of the tubes, with resulting ovate forms.                                               In the
fourth     place, where               the movement              of material has been great                        and
effected under great pressure, the tubes                             will       have been more               or    less
completely         crushed        and flattened and distorted.                           In   the    fifth place,
where the tube               has been preserved                 at all, so as to show its                  original
walls, those walls will very probably be traceable                                            by a       deposit or
staining of oxide of iron, replacing the animal matter which origin
ally agglutinated the sand.                          In     the sixth place,               this feature           will
necessarily           be    very variable according to the greater                                   or      smaller
quantity of iron in the sand or clay.                                    In   the seventh place, where
the tube has been so far preserved                             as   to present           a cross         section    of
the substance               filling up    the interior              of    it,   there     will      be   a   visible
difference       between          that substance and the material outside the tubes,
corresponding to the difference which has resulted from the selec
tion by the worm of the liner from the coarser particles,                                            and of the
argillaceous particles from the purely silicious, because of their greater
richness in digestible organic matter.                                    In the eighth              place,       this
selection     of the finer clay particles by the worm, and the voidance of
them     in   the tube behind             it,   would constitute                a   definite and probably
a    lasting difference               in the mineral conditions of the whole space
occupied           by      the   path of        the       worm, which                  difference        would      be
reproduced            and perpetuated            by the different behaviour of different
mineral substances                under the processes of metamorphism — whatever
these may have been.                    In     the ninth place, as in all the surrounding
country the silicious strata are in general sharply distinguished from
the    argillaceous beds, and                   as    these last have                  been generally meta
morphosed             into mica slates, with pure mica very highly developed
in most of them, we should expect to find,                                    as   a   necessity of the case,
a   corresponding development of mica and of micaceous particles in
the inside of the worm                    tubes           or along the lines of alteration and

deformation to which these may have been exposed                       by crushing or
slipping movements in the rock.                In   the tenth place, in cases whore
 the tubes have been exposed to the solvent action of sea-water, or,
 in other     words,    to weathering        on a sea-beach,       and    where,  conse
 quently, all the special products due to the chemical and mechanical
 and vital action of the worms have been excavated and removed, we
 should expect to find the sides of the cavity thus left presenting a
peculiar     coarsely   granular surface, from the old abstraction of the
 finer   and    the    more argillaceous        particles which        the worm      had
 swallowed      and ejected       in   a comparatively        loose   and    incoherent
state.     In   the   eleventh    place,    as our    living annelids      are various,
 and produce variously shaped               burrows, we should expect to find
 some worm-paths less simple and less easily recognised                    than others,
 — such,    for example,      as   irregularities, bunches or knots, bays,           and
 branches in the path,       — or perhaps such definite and characteristic
varieties    as   club-shaped burrows, which are now actually produced
 by some living species.*
    I have    placed    on the table to-day specimens            from the Inveraray
quartzite which fulfil and illustrate every one of these anticipations.
The    prevalence     of ovate forms wherever we have cross sections of the
old    planes of bedding;        the   narrowing or elongation of these ovate
forms in proportion as the section               is oblique to the bedding; the
reduction of these to mere linear streaks                  where    the squeezing      of
the rocks seems to have been greatest; the altered                   character of the
matter     which      occupies     the interior      of the ovate       spaces,   where
metamorphism has not gone far — all these characters are beautifully
marked.        The conversion of the same material into shining mica,
where metamorphism has               been   more    advanced,    is not less striking.
 In  some     of    the  specimens        the brilliancy of the silvery            mica,
especially when seen in sunlight               and with a lens, traces out the
ancient     worm paths        with extraordinary          distinctness.       The oval
rings of oxide of iron, which indicate the transverse                       sections   of
the tubing, is one of the most marked characteristics, of one at least,
of the beds.       The coarse granulations of the rock, in cavities out of
which the worm-work            has been excavated by the sea,              is typically
exhibited     in the only         specimen      which     has   been     found    under
exposure    to the necessary conditions           ;  whilst there is one specimen

exhibiting    the path of the tubes in longitudinal              section,  in which
the annelid origin of the channel explains itself, as it seems to me,
unmistakably     to the eye.        On showing it to         an old fisherman       at
Inveraray, who knows the worms well as bait for his lines, and on.
asking him if he did not         see  the burrows there, his only reply was,
"Oh    aye, but that's in the middle         o' the    rock!"   a difficulty    which
belongs to      what the late Lord Derby called " the pre-scientific
age."
    There is yet one other specimen to which             I must refer,     because   it
was   one   of those     which    for a time secured         me    as   most   like   a
vegetable   impression.      It  consists in perfectly straight parallel lines,
marked in black upon the white ground of the rock.                    The lines con
sist simply of black or dark bronze stains on the grains of the
quartzite.     That they represent the staining of annelid              tubes  I  have
now no doubt.         It  may be the result of that copious and almost
ubiquitous deposit of the black oxide of manganese which                  Dr Murray
has discovered on almost all organic matter long exposed to the pene
tration of sea-water.       Or it may be due to an effect which is noted
by Professor Mackintosh in respect to some species of these annelids,
that where the animal dies in its tube it leaves upon the walls a
 black stain like a "a black carbonaceous            film."*
    I attach no importance whatever to any interpretation                    of these
 marks in the quartzite      as regards    the evidence     they may thus afford
 against a notion which seems to have been lately started, that our
 western mica-slate      rocks are not of sedimentary origin at all, or
 that their apparent bedding is not truly such, but is the effect of
 what is called foliation.       No    geologist,  I  venture to think, who has
 lived among      these   rocks as      I  have   done,    and who has become
 familiar  with the innumerable proofs of sedimentary origin which
 they exhibit,   can entertain       this new notion        even    for a moment.
 The absence     of organic remains in the             presence    of such    obvious
 metamorphism        affords    no    presumption        whatever      against their
 sedimentary origin.       I have     been   accustomed      sometimes     to look at
 the enormous      masses of secondary          and tertiary limestones which
 constitute the maritime Alps in southern                France, and to look         in
 vain among these seemingly unaltered beds for the traces of shells
 or of other organisms.          These, indeed, are found;             but they are

often confined to some one bed, hardly more than a few inches thick
— proving     that the conditions       under which organisms have been
preserved in rocks are peculiar and are often absent.                 The same
lesson   may be learned from the Cambrian sandstones,                underlying
this quartzite in the Northern Highlands, in which          we find abundant
ripple-marks, but no trace of life.          In this  case, of course, we are
not absolutely certain that life existed at all in the area, and at the
time, of the deposit of the sandstones.            But  as regards the mica-
slate series in Argyllshire, the indications        of marine sedimentation
 are quite as decisive,   and so far   as  this conclusion is concerned,      the
 discovery   of marine     organic    remains is by no means            required.
 Neither, in my opinion, are they needed           to confirm the geological
 horizon   of Silurian    age  to which     our metamorphic       rocks in the
 South- Western Highlands have been long presumably assigned.                  As
 regards Argyllshire,    at least, this presumption      rests   upon evidence
 far  more  direct than the conjecture of Murchison, that our rocks
 represent the southward prolongation of the beds which have yielded
 in Sutherland fossils of     ascertained    Lower Silurian    type, and which
 are there found above the Cambrians on the west and below the Old
 Red Sandstones on the       east.   That conjecture was, I believe, a true
 one, and the general facts on      which it rested remain unshaken. "But
 the evidence for the Silurian horizon of the mica slates, schists, and
 quartzites of Argyllshire,     is much more direct than the evidence           in
 respect to the same rocks as developed farther               north    or in the
 central   Grampians.      All    round    our Argyllshire coasts       we   have
 patches and fragments left of the same Old Red conglomerates                 and
 sandstones, which are faulted against the south-eastern           flanks of the
 Grampians,     from the Clyde       to   Stonehaven.     These patches and
 fragments of the Old Red are everywhere seen to lie, or to have
 lain, over and upon the upturned beds of the metamorphic series.
  In  some   places   they have remained         in considerable      mass,   and
 include   thick beds of limestone        as  well as of freestone.       This is
 the case on the coast of Kintyre, from the harbour of Campbelltown
 to Southend, near the      Mull of Kintyre.       The limestones of the Old
 Red in that district      have been highly silicified, and so far as yet
 observed all organic remains have been obliterated.             But  these lime
 stones  with  associated   beds of freestone have their geological horizon
 determined in Kintyre by the direct evidence of dipping under the

ferous series and the Coal Measures.                                    There is no reason, so far as
I    know, to separate the metamorphic slates of Kintyre from those
of the more northern areas of the county, of which the peninsula
of Kintyre seems to be                      a mere     prolongation.               Instead, therefore,              of
seeking to           identify         the     local quartzite                of Inveraray         as    Silurian
because of its annelid remains,                        I   should be disposed to identify those
remains       as due to         annelids, because of the clear stratigraphical                                 evi
dence that these quartzites are Silurian.                                    When    we find that            in the
Northern        Silurians these silicious                    beds have preserved              their organic
remains far better and far more generally than the calcareous                                                beds,
we have        good     reason         to expect as probable                      the same result in the
South- Western              Silurian         series.        It    is the     obliteration, and not the
preservation, of annelid markings, which needs explanation                                                in our
Argyllshire          quartzites, such as those                        of   Jura ami Islay.              It    is,   of
course,       quite easy to understand                           that      such    markings        should           be
squeezed out under enormous pressures.                                       But, on the other hand,                it
is   only the fulfilment of                 a   natural and reasonable                expectation when
we do find certain beds in the south that have preserved                                               the traces
of the particular form of life which seems to have been so abundant
when the northern Silurian quartzites were deposited.                                        The compara
tively thin beds in which the annelid                                 tubes are found at Inveraray
are by no        means          the     lowest in our series.                       They are underlaid
and overlaid by             a   great        number of beds both slaty and silicious.
But     the    great    mass          is    slaty, with           a     highly-developed           micaceous
character.           The correlated             development of mica in the quartzite
bed     itself, where           the.   annelids            have       selected      and    segregated          the
argillaceous particles, seems to throw                                  an    important      light on this
product of metamorphism.
     There     is,   however,          another question connected                          with    geological
t-cience which         is   of high importance, and on which the appearances

 diate bearing.             That question relates to the movements                     effected in
 these strata,         subsequent      to their induration, by subterranean                   causes.
 3(ore than         thirty-five years ago, before            any special      controversy had
 arisen on the comparative               effects of atmospheric denudation, and of
 subterranean movement                on the structure of our mountains in the west
 of Scotland,          I   had been led by the facts presented in our intrusive
 rocks, especially by our porphyries, to conclude that these masses had
 risen along           the planes     of deposition among the sedimentary series,
 and that their intrusion               among these was contemporaneous                       with a
falling in of the sedimentary beds                       along   certain lines of weakness,
due         to    weight     from under which support had been                         withdrawn.
Such a movement                 of falling in, or tumbling down, along linos of
consequent             depression, would        necessarily        be accompanied         by the
slipping and sliding of the falling beds over each other along the
of     planes       sedimentation.         This conclusion           I   communicated           in   a
paper to the Geological Society of London                            so long ago as 1853.*
It    is,   therefore, no surprise to me to find that these bodies, whether
they be worm-casts,              as
                                 I     now confidently believe, or whether they be
purely mineral in their origin, prove conclusively that the rocks in
which they are found have been sheared— or have                                  slipped — over
each other by movements                   due to subterranean              causes.   I    am not
myself able to conceive               how mineral concretions,            such as iron pyrites,
or clay balls, or any other form of purely mineral aggregation,                                could
have been so formed as, when pulled out and sheared, to present
the    uniformly           ovate, or semi-ovate      sections, together with the purely
linear tube-like forms presented to us in these specimens.                              But   if   this
be the explanation of them, the shearing must have been very great.
On my own interpretation of an organic                           origin, some shearing, and
squeezing, and elongation of the worm-casts                         is   equally admitted.         I
see no evidence,               indeed, that our hills about Inveraray have been
ever exposed to such tremendous                     earth movements          of horizontal dis
placement as those which have recently been revealed in Sutherland.
But   I          have long been        satisfied    that the forms of our Highland
mountains are due mainly to subterranean                          subsidences,   with contem
poraneous issue of plutonic and intrusive rocks; and the appearances
in the quartzite now described and exhibited are, on any conceivable

 theory of their origin, a convincing indication that such movements
 have extensively prevailed,       and must have left      a  corresponding     effect
 on the structure of our mountains.            At the same time,   it is  undeniable
 that there has been enormous           subsequent     removal of material,       and
that in many     cases   the structure due to subterranean         causes has been
so smoothed      over   and   obliterated to the eye that it is only in acci
 dental sections they can be traced at all.
    I have now only to add, that since this paper was read before the
Society,  a correspondent,      Mr Peter Macnair, Perth,           has sent to     me
some specimens       of annelid tubes      and castings,     from a rock high up
Craig-na-Challeich, one of the mountains above             Eillin,  at the western
end of Loch      Tay, in Perthshire.           These markings exhibit        all the
characteristic features before         specified   and described.       They are on
the weathered      surface of a rock highly silicious and          micaceous,    and
are more    distinctly marked on that surface            than any     I  have found
in a similar position.        A band of      limestone  lies below the quartzite
near the base of the        mountain, and        these two    beds are separated
from each other by many other beds of conformable quartz-schists.
These    details  I  state  from   a  very clear section      kindly furnished     to
me by   Mr Macnair.          Now     that we are all put upon the scent,            I
have no doubt whatever that the Inveraray annelids                   will  be found
to have had many countrymen and companions                 in the central as well
as in the south-western Highlands.

                                 (Read January 21, 1889.)
                                       (Abstract.)
    In  the preceding part of this paper           I considered    the consequences
of a special assumption as to the nature of the molecular force between
two particles,       the particles themselves         being  still  treated   as hard
spheres.       My  object was to obtain, by means of rigorous calculation,
in as simple a form as possible, a general              notion of the effects due
to the molecular forces.            My  present object is to apply this general
notion to the formation and interpretation of the Virial Equation.
     In the    extremely ingenious Thesis of Van der Waals, who first
 succeeded in representing by            a  simple formula the main results of
 the researches       of Andrews       on the Isothermals of         Carbonic Acid,
 the   Virial Equation       was employed; but, as was remarked by Clerk-
 Maxwell (Nature, Oct.            15, 1874),
                                                " where he has borrowed results
 from Clausius and others, he has applied them in                  a manner     which
 appears    to me to be erroneous."           The object of the present paper is
 to attempt    a legitimate (though, of course, only roughly approximate)
 application of the Virial Equation to the same question.                 The result
  cannot differ much quantitatively           (though it may be widely different
  qualitatively)    from that of Van der Waals,           if it  also can represent
  Andrews' experimental data.
      The Virial Equation       is
                                        =
                              U(m^)        |^V   + |2(Rr).
  From this Van der "Waals derives the following expression                 : —
  in which the right-hand          member is treated as a constant multiple        of
 the absolute    temperature.        Now it    is certain that, when there is no
 molecular force except that of impact, the term

takes, to a first approximation      at least, the value
                                        -bp,
and the whole becomes
                            p(V-b)-Wtni?).
    The principles on which the Virial equation was itself based                  for
bid us to    introduce any change in the meaning of the factor p,
which has     already been strictly defined as external pressure.                Van
der Waals, however, retains this form of the Virial equation (derived
without the assumption of molecular attraction), modifying it simply
by the addition to p of a term a/V2, which is the internal pressure
(K of Laplace)     due to the molecular forces.         Undoubtedly       the com
plete Virial equation, when molecular forces are taken into account,
must contain a term somewhat of this nature               ;  but  it ought to be
obtained (with its proper factor) directly as a part of the expression
 i2(Rr). It seems to me that this must be the main point to which
 Clerk-Maxwell     referred in the passage above quoted.            It is   curious
 that Glausius did not raise this objection to Van der Waals* equation,
but contented himself          with making modifications derived from
general   considerations, by which it was changed from
                                         kt

    The close agreement of Van der Waals' equation, the first of these,
 with Andrews' experimental results            was exceedingly remarkable         : —
 and Clausius' modified form seems to suit them almost exactly                !
    But Clerk-Maxwell       says (loc.   cit), " though this   agreement     would
 be strong evidence     in favour of the     accuracy of an empirical      formula
 devised to represent the experimental results, the equation of M. Van
 der Waals, professing as it does to be derived from the dynamical
 theory, must be subjected to a much more severe criticism."
    Along with the objection just mentioned, there is another and
 serious one.     Van der Waals' equation appears to be unwarrantably
 simple,  as it contains               the k of the    " perfect   gas
                                                                        "

 that (even if the law of molecular force were the same for all bodies,

(2) for the range of molecular force                         ;   (3) for the maximum relative
potential energy of two particles.                       It       is quite clear that these three
must     be assumed             to he entirely independent of one another                                 ;    at
least unless experiment should, some day, prove the existence                                             of a
relation among them.
  The general results obtained in Part III. of this paper show that,
when molecular attraction is taken into                                account,      the whole kinetic
energy must exceed that of particles                             free from molecular forces by a
term proportional to the fraction of                             the    whole particles which are,
at any           and eery time, within molecular                           range       of one another.
(This      raises another point on which                          I    cannot agree with previous
writers.          It   will   be discussed        later.)          Hence,      if   r2 = 3/2/(       when the
volume is practically infinite,               we have approximately
 where       e    and a may be treated            (within certain limits at least) as
 constants.            The negative       sign is given to a because the particles (in
 consequence of the presumed intensity of the molecular force) move
 very much faster when under mutual influence, and therefore spend
 relatively       less time        in that part of their              space.    It   is not easy to           see
 what,     if any,       change of form            this expression              must take when                 V
 becomes so small that no single particle is ever free from the action
 of the molecular             forces of a number of others.                     For     the    present we
 may employ it           as   it    stands even when the volume is of the order a.
 It     is possible that there may                 be gases (hydrogen                  1)   in which, on
 account of the comparative feebleness of the molecular force, a may
 be positive       :   the effect of the increased length of the relative path
 not being overcome by the increase of relative speed.                                        But, in this
 abstract,       I merely      mention the question.
   The term £2(Rr) gives the negative part -pfi due to the impacts,
 where /9 also may be regarded (at first, at least) as constant, though
 it certainly increases with diminution of volume.                                    This     is,   at least,
  the   result obtained when the only molecular forces considered                                         are
  due to   the elastic         resilience.        It   evidently should be considerably
  modified by the introduction                    of   the       molecular attraction            ;    but we
  will not, for the present,              insist on this point further                        than to say

rank them all in order of magnitude.
     This equation               is,   at first sight, quite different in form from that
of    Van der Waals, even                       as      modified by Clausius, and                               I      think    it
undoubtedly             represents            move          accurately            than do these the true
result of the application of the Virial.                                     It   introduces five constants,

        would seem to          be that of a species                 of Adiabatic.              Van der 'Waals
        and Clausius do not call attention                    to the fact that the whole kinetic

        energy necessarily        varies           with     the volume (when there                          are inter-
        molecular forces,        and      the mean-square                 speed of a          j'ne particle is
        regarded      as constant), and            therefore        cannot be regarded                  as constant
        in the Virial Equation unless heat                          is given to (or taken from) the

            The answer would              seem to be           :   — difference         of temperature,             as
        measured       experimentally,              depends         upon the           gross     rate         of heat

         of relative     speed    of pairs of particles will not affect their heat-
         transactions        with the walls of the containing                               vessel,     or with a
         thermometer, the part E, alone,                      is     entitled to be interpreted                     as
         proportional        to the    absolute           temperature.           This will, apparently,
         be the case so long as, at every instant, the majority of the particles
         are      free from molecular              force.      But       a    different        result may           be
         expected when none (or a small minority only) are free from mole
         cular force. And here                 I
                                   may mention, in passing, another con
         nected     complication.         There must be molecular force between the
          particles and the walls of the vessel ; so that                              p,   as defined         in   the
          Virial equation, is     necessarily         greater than the value calculated                          from
          ft,   even when the volume           is    so great that the effect of the molecular
          force    between the particles             is   insensible.           [It    is   possible that this

    Consider, for a moment, the case of a              gas,   in which the        kinetic-
energy is not much greater than that due to the                      molecular forces
alone, these being so        intense     as  to  aggregate      its particles      into     a
group, so that scarcely       any of them ever escape from the                  thick of
the encounter.       Its external      pressure   would be practically           nil, and
its temperature      (as measured        by a thermometer)           close to   absolute
zero,   although    the    mean    kinetic    energy    per particle may be           very
high.      Such  a group    would no more communicate               heat to a    thermo
meter plunged in        it than would       water (in consequence          of Laplace's
K)   squeeze a finger dipped         into it.     Next, consider the case            of a
liquid    in contact with its saturated          vapour, at       a    temperature       so
low that      there  is great    difference     of density between           the   states.
On the hypothesis which underlies the whole of my work (viz.,
that the particles are hard spheres,             with unit coefficient          of resti
tution) permanently double or multiple particles cannot occur in
the vapour.       Here the average kinetic energy per particle, in the
liquid, should apparently        be much greater           than in the vapour, yet
 their temperature and their (external) pressure are the same.                    On the
 other hand, the condensation of part of the vapour produces a rise
 of temperature.        It seems to follow that         E    (defined    as   above) be
 comes less in the    liquid than in    the vapour state,      if the temperature be
 maintained constant.        In other     words, no formation of          liquid is   pos-
 sible isothermally unless heat he abstracted            ;  not even if the walls of
 the  containing vessel could be made to shrink                 in, bit by bit where
 no impact is impending, without doing work on the gas.                        And,   con
 versely,   a liquid cannot, without supply of heat, be dissipated into
 vapour even in vacuo.         The effect on the above equation would                   be
 to make     E + L, and    not E, proportional to the absolute             temperature,
 L  being   a  quantity    which becomes rapidly less as the temperature
 rises towards the critical point.          The only noteworthy effects of this,
 on the graphical representation         of the Isothermals, would be to shift
 them parallel to the pressure axis, by amounts                which increase        from
 the  critical point downwards;           and   to (slightly)     modify their form
 in the neighbourhood of           the    minimum ordinate of each.                 Their
 general     appearance     will   be   unchanged,       while      our    hypothetical

measure  of temperature accounts for the so-called latent heat of
vapours.   And it is clear that similar reasoning may be extended to
the passage from the              liquid to the solid                   state.         A     great number of
very curious results follow as immediate consequences                                           of this mode
of regarding the temperature of a group of particles, but this is not
the place for them.
  If, with Van             der    Waals and Clausius,                        I       had taken the whole
kinetic energy            as the measure               of the          absolute temperature, my
equation would have been of the form
which does not            seem fitted to represent                    Andrews' results.
  For the          reasons given above,            I   think          we ought to write
  This may             be made to resemble             closely Van der Waals' equation if
we take       /3

                       (Aa Cy)/(A C) ;                 but        I    see       no physical reason for
this assumption.
  It   is clear, from the point of view which                                    I   have     taken, that the
equation as given cannot be more than a rough approximation                                                    to
the truth.             The calculation of the proper values of the constants,
to adapt      it with      great accuracy to Andrews' results for carbonic acid,
would involve considerable                  labour      :   — more perhaps than                    the    results
to be obtained are worth.
   I   have therefore,         guided by the indications given above as to the
relative magnitudes of a,                 (3,   y, tentatively found values                        of the    con

face of them obviously provisional, but which sufficiently show how
well-fitted the formula              is   to express         the       main facts.             The resulting
equation which          I     first got in this way               is

                                   A    Natural History.
     In February       1 870, the author made a communication to this Society
on the     Kombe Arrow-Poison of Africa,             a product of the Stroplianthiis
higpidus plant.            In  that communication the nature of its action on
the various structures of the body, and the chemical composition of
the seeds of the plant, which are the most active part, were
described.         It    was pointed out that the action is chiefly exerted
 upon      the heart and upon the muscles of the body, and that the
 seeds      contain a crystalline active principle of the nature of a
 glucoside,      to which     the name Strophanthin        was given.
       From the examination then made of the action of the seeds of
  this Strophanthus, as well as of its active principle, strophanthin,
  it was anticipated that Strophanthus would prove                   to be of great
  value in the treatment of disease, and especially of                disease  of the
   heart    ; and a few years later the author employed it for this purpose
   in   a small number of cases.
        Various    circumstances,      such as the difficulty     in procuring suf
    ficient   supplies    of the seeds, prevented the author from making
    the number      of observations that      appeared to be necessary before the
    value of Strophanthus in the treatment of disease could be properly
     estimated; and      it was not     until  1885   that sufficient evidence    had
     been obtained to authorise any public announcement on the subject.
         In the interval of     fifteen   years which    elapsed  between    the first
     communication to this Society and the communication of 1885 to
     the  British Medical Association,        the subject attracted so little atten
     tion that oidy two papers were published on it.
         One of these papers        dealt with the physiological action, and con
     tinued the statements        made    in the communication to this Society.
     The second    paper     dealt only with the chemical composition of the
     Strophanthus seeds, but the chief statements             it contained,   such as
      that the  active principle is not a glucoside, have since been amply
      shown to be erroneous.

    Subsequently, however, to the communication of 1885,                      upon      the
therapeutical applications of the substance,                the    literature    of     the
subject has rapidly increased, and it now embraces about                    a hundred
separate     papers, the     greater     number of which deal with its uses in
the treatment       of disease.
     Until   1885, also, Strophanthus,          elsewhere   than in Africa,         was a
mere curiosity, represented            in  a  few museums      in Europe by speci
mens of its flowers and fruit.              Since that time,    it has become a not
inconsiderable article of commerce, several tons of the seeds                    having
 been exported       from Africa by London merchants alone, in                 order to
 supply the requirements of medical practice.
     In   the  present    paper     it  is proposed    to give   an account      of    the
 observations      that   have     been made       by the author on the         natural
 history, chemistry,       and     pharmacology (or physiological action) of
 Strophanthus, but to-night only the first of the above subdivisions
 of the subject would be dealt with.
     In nearly     every   narrative of exploration in uncivilised              tropical
 regions,    accounts   are given of poisonous         substances,     which in many
 instances    are stated to possess remarkable properties.               Usually these
 poisons are of vegetable, origin, and             nearly all of them may be in
 cluded in the two great divisions of Ordeal and of Arrow poisons.
 Among the most interesting of the Ordeal poisons                       are the  Phi/so-
 stigma venenosum and             the    Akazga or Akaja of West            Africa, the
 Sassy or Muave of wide distribution               over Africa, and the      Tanghinia
  venifera of Madagascar ; and of the Arrow poisons, the Atitiari*
 fojcicaria and Strychnos Tievte of Java, the Aconitum ferox of
  China, and the famous "Wourali or Carare poison of South America.
      It is to the enterprise      and observation of explorers          and travellers
  that we are indebted for the first knowledge of the Strophanthus
  Kombe-poison.         The     first    specimens    of  the    plant that reached
  Edinburgh       appear    to   have     been   a few ripe follicles      sent   to   Sir
  liobcrt Christison       early in 18G9, by the         Rev. Horace Waller, who
  had been      a   member      of    the Oxford     and Cambridge        Universities'
  Mission of 18G1-62, superintended by the late Uishop Mackenzie,
  with whom had been associated, during the operations of the Mission
  in the country between             the river Shire and       the lake Shirwa, the
  famous traveller Livingstone            and the enterprising botanist         Kirk,   at
  that time     H.M. Consul        at Zanzibar.       Mr Waller informs        me that,

isss-89.]       Dr   Thomas R. Fraser on Stroplianthus hispid us.                   75
at his suggestion, the follicles were brought to this country by Mr E.
D. Young, R.N., when he went to Africa, in 1867, to clear up the
story    of Livingstone's     murder.
     Sir Jolm Kirk      had previously discovered          that the Kombe poison
is prepared from the         seeds contained     in   these follicles.    In   a letter
received from him (31st October             1888),     he thus describes      the dis
covery: — " I       had long sought for it (the source of the Koinbf
 poison),     hut the natives invariably gave me some false plant, until
 one day at Chibisa's village, on the river Shire, I saw the ' Kombe,'
 then new to me as an Eastern African plant (I had known an allied
 species at Sierra Leone (1858), where it is             used as a poison).     There,
 climbing on a tall tree, it was in pod, and             I could get no one to go
  up and collect specimens.         On mounting         the tree myself      to reach
  the Kombe pods, the natives, afraid that             I  might poison myself if      I
  handled the plant roughly or got the juice in a cut or in my mouth,
                                                                                       '
  warned me to be careful, and admitted that this was the ' Kombe
   or poison plant.      In this way    the poison was identified."
       Livingstone,   in his Narrative of an Expedition to the Zambesi
   and its Tributari^ (1858-1864), states that the tribes inhabiting
   the Mikuru-Madse,       a  tributary   of the Shire river, use this poison
   for    arrows,   with   which     they    kill    buffaloes    and other game.
    " Poisoned    arrows are made in two pieces.           An iron   barb is fastened
    to one end of a small wand of wood, ten inches or a foot in length,
    the other end of which, fined down to a long point, is nicely fitted,
    though    not otherwise secured,       in  the hollow       of the reed, which
    forms the arrow shaft.       The wood immediately below the iron head
    is smeared with the poison.       When     an arrow is shot into the animal,
    the reed falls to the ground at once, or is very soon brushed off by
    the branches, but the iron         barb   and poisoned        part of the wood
    remain in the wound.        If made in one piece, the arrow would often
    be torn out, head and all, by the long shaft catching              in the under
    wood, or striking against trees."
       Mr John Buchanan thus describes              the method followed in pre
                             "
    paring the poison : — A man breaks              a follicle   and puts the seeds
    with the wool attached into      a pot.    He then takes       a  small piece of
    bamboo,    which has two thin splints inserted crosswise in the end,
    and he revolves this      speedily by rubbing          it  between    his hands.
    The seeds are thus put into motion, and fall to the bottom of the

pot, and     tho wool rises and comes out at the top,                 and   is carried
away by the least breath of wind.               The seeds are then         put into a
small mortar and pounded into a paste, which is then ready                      for    use.
It  is common      to mix the milky juice of a Euphorbia with              it  to make
it stick   to the arrow."
   This arrow poison           has also     been found at the western            side of
                                       as the " Inee       or " Onage,"

Africa,    where     it is known                                               and the
poison has been traced to            a   Strophanthus, which is probably               the
species hispidus, although the            flowers   do not appear to       have been
yet obtained.
   Only     a   few poisoned       arrows have reached          this   country      from
Africa, owing, no doubt to some extent, to the difficulties                      of car
riage, but certainly much          more    to the   reluctance     of the   natives to
place poisoned arrows in the possession              of Europeans.        The    author
had, however,       been able to examine         arrows of eight different forms
obtained from various parts of Africa.                 Two of them were arrows
 known to      be poisoned     with Strophanthus.         Of   the others,    either no
knowledge of the poison existed, or it was believed                    to be    derived
from plants other than Strophanthus.
    Microscopical,       chemical,   and physiological        examination showed
that the poison of six of the eight arrows consists principally,                  if  not
entirely, of     a substance     made with the seeds of Strophanthus              ;  and
it  is an illustration      of the extensive      use  of this poison that these
arrows should have been obtained from districts                 so  widely separated
from each other as the river            Gambir, the Tanganyika lake, and the
 Zambesi     river.
    Of   the other two arrows,         one, originally poisoned        on the arrow
 head, was found to be inert         ;  and the other, obtained        in the Wanika
 country, was found to be poisoned                 with   a substance      acting like
 Strophanthus, but not giving its chemical              reactions,    nor exhibiting,
 on microscopic        examination, any structure that could be identified
 with the structures       in the seeds of Strophanthus.          It is probable    that
 the poison of the last arrow has been derived              from a wood or root.
     Decandolle, in 1802, first described          the genus Strophanthus, and
 gave   it this   name because of the          twisted, thong-like prolongations
 of the lobes of the corolla (o-rpo^os,            a cord,    and ai-Ooi, a flower).
 About twenty species are at present known, eight of which are found
 in Africa, and the others in India China,                 Malacca, and Burniah.

 Straphanthus Kom.be is not included in this enumeration, as Pro
fessor     Oliver, after an examination of further and                 more    complete
specimens       of the flowers and       leaves, now regards     it  as

geographical race,         of Strophanthus hispidus."         The species hinpidus
has been        found only in Africa, and is widely distributed over its
tropical and subtropical regions.
     Mr Buchanan has at various               times  sent  specimens       of the root,
stem,      branches,     leaves, flowers,    and fruit, and has thus supplied
materials for a description          of the different parts of the plant.
     These     parts were exhibited and described, and                  also a young
growing plant, reared from seed by Mr Lindsay, of the Royal Botanic
Garden of Edinburgh.
      In  reference to the fruit,     it was pointed    out that    it consists of two
 follicles, united at the ventral surfaces in the young state, but gradu
 ally separated, as maturity advances,              by  a hinge-like    movement at
 their bases, until each separated follicle projects from the fruit stalk,
  almost at right angles with it.            When fully mature, the two follicles
  form together a nearly straight line, whose extremities are the apices
  of the follicles.
       Each ripe follicle contains three separate structures — the placenta,
   the seeds, and a large quantity of hairs interposed between                 the seeds
   and the endocarp.
       As    the follicle   matures,  its ventral or placental surface          enlarges
   by the inverted edges of the carpels, which project united together
    into the interior of the follicle in its immature condition, splitting up
    more and more, and so expanding this surface.             At  the same time, the
    dorsal surface of the follicle, consisting of the thick and strong peri
    carp, becomes less rounded, and the placenta,            with its still     attached
    seeds, is    brought close to the expanded          ventral surface.         By and
    by, as maturity       advances,  and the     funiculus   of the seeds becomes
    weakened      by drying, the seeds break off from the funiculus, and lie
    loose   in the interior of    the follicle.
       The follicle    ruptures at the expanded ventral surface,            which is its
    weakest     portion, and through this rupture the seeds are extruded.
    The actual extrusion of the seeds seems to be produced by the separa
    tion from each other of the hairs of the comose appendages,                and espe
    cially  of the hairs separating        the seeds from the endocarp.            These
    hairs, in the green and moist state of the follicles, are in close contact

  with each other    ; but in the mature dry state they acquire elasticity,
  and tend to become separated from each other, and they                 thus    press
  the seeds through the split ventral surface of the follicle.
     The hairs separating       the seeds from the endocarp        seem   to possess
  the additional function of preventing fracture of the long and brittle
  stalks of the comose appendages, by forming a soft and yielding bed
  for the seeds during their changes of position before they escape
  from the follicle; and they thus insure that the seeds shall                be dis
  seminated   with tho comose appendages attached to them.
     Drawings    and microscopic preparations were exhibited                to illus
  trate the histology of the different parts of the plant.

 and    so on.     The    variously    modified     individuals    are  connected
 together   by  a   general    ccenenchyma,     which enables      the nutriment
elaborated    by the gastrozooids       to be utilised by other members           of
 the colony.      Perhaps some of the most             interesting and complex
cases   of polymorphism are to be found amongst the Siphonophora.
     Amongst the Anthozoa dimorphism               frequently occurs in certain
groups of Aleyonaria,          but in these cases apparently the speciali
sation never results      in  the formation of reproductive zooids.            The
modified individuals        (Siphonozooid*) differ from those of typical
structure in the absence of tentacles,          the great     development of    the
siphonoglyphe, and in other points.              They are usually hut not in
variably sexless, and in certain           cases are     stated  to develop into
typical zooids.      In  the    Actiniaria the animal is usually solitary;

colonial forms, however, do occur, but so far as is known none of
them are     dimorphic.       The Madreporaria         include both colonial and
solitary forms.       Our knowledge of          the structure of the zooids is as
yet confined to a few species, and so far as                I  am aware    the only
known case       of dimorphism is that described by Fowler in Madre-
pora DurvilJei.         In this case the specialisation affects certain of
the mesenteries in the modified individuals.                 In the normal zooids
all the mesenteries are similar in structure.              In the modified zooids
six ont of twelve         mesenteries     (alternate    ones)   become   thickened,
and contain a ciliated ectodermal             canal  running through their sub
 stance,   and opening     at both ends into the stomodaeum.            Apparently
 both types     are nutritive and both are reproductive, but Fowler is
 of opinion      that the normal        zooid   is more    reproductive, and the
 modified     zooid more nutritive.            Thus in this, the only        case   of
  dimorphism previously         described     amongst    the   Zoantharia, there is
  no complete specialisation into nutritive and reproductive zooids, and
  it is of interest to       note that      in another     species   of Madrepora
  (M. o^pera), examined by Fowler,               a similar dimorphism      does not
  exist.
      A study of    the " Challenger" collection of Antipatharia has shown
   that   some of the genera         are   dimorphic,     whilst   others   are  not.
   Nearly all the species obtained at great depths are dimorphic, but
   others come under the same category which occur in shallower                 seas.
   The nature of the dimorphism and the manner in which it                        has
   probably been produced will be best understood by a study of                   the
   general morphology of a few typical forms.
       Most Antipathidoe      have    the horny axial skeleton more or less
    branched, and the zooids are usually situated in a single linear
    series on the branches,    and are connected together by         a ccenenchyma
    which contains an axial prolongation of their coelentera, neighbour
    ing zooids being thus brought into communication with one another.
    A vertical   mesogloeal   partition is usually present       between   adjoining
    zooids,  but is  never so complete     as to prevent intercommunication.
       In a typical zooid there     are six tentacles    and three pairs of well-
    developed    mesenteries,  and,    in addition,   there   may be two or three
    other   pairs,  which   are   always more        or less    rudimentary.      The
     stomodaum is elongated      in   the sagittal axis, and usually occupies a
    position at right angles to the axis of the branch on which                   the

tive organs        ;   these occupy the transverse                 axis, and are          situated, one
on each side of the stomodieum.                          The transverse         pair of mesenteries,
on account of their position, have                       a greater than  horizontal breadth
any of the others, and they are also usually somewhat longer than
those at each end of the stomodieum (" directives         In the species          ").

the insertion of the sagittal tentacles i'ato the Dody wall instead of
into the peristome                interferes with the regularity.                      The diameter         of
the zooiil in the sagittal and transverse                         axes    is,   however,       practically
the same, and           the tentacles         have       a   radiate     arrangement.           In Anti-
]>athel!a     a   slight elongation of the zooid in the transverse axis has
the effect of making the tentacles                       appear    in two rows of three each,
parallel with the axis of the branch.                           On account of the oval                out
line, there       is    in this genus            a   greater       disproportion          between the
breadth of the transverse                mesenteries,             as compared            with the    " di
rectives," than          is   the     case    in CirrijHttli's.             The increase          in the
length of the transverse axis                 is,   however, not great, and the tentacles
do not become removed                 far apart.             In Parantipaihes, however, the
transverse        mesenteries         become         enormously elongated,                so    that the
length in the transverse       axis   three or four times that in the
                                                    is
sagittal.       The elongation has the effect of carrying the " lateral "
tentacles      further     away from the stomodamm,                             so      that they now
appear clearly as three pairs some distance apart.                                   The middle pair,
as   in other genera, are situated one at each end of the stomodaaum,
and the      " directive      "
                                  mesenteries are very narrow.                       In Paraidijmthes
larix, (lisp.) the peristome                  becomes         somewhat          depressed       on   each
side of the oral         prominence,          so     that the zooid presents indications
of   a   division into three lobes,          a   central one containing the stomoda?unj
and thti proximal ends of all the                        mesenteries,       and two lateral ones
containing the greater part of the transverse                              mesenteries.           It will
be   remembered          that      the reproductive elements                     are     borne on the
transverse      mesenteries         only, and in Paranlijiathes                      they are confined
to those portions of them which are situated within the lateral lobes.
It   may be meutioned              that in this genus the greatest diameter of the

 stomodsum           frequently      corresponds with the transverse             instead of
 with the sagittal axis, as            is  also the case     in Amphianthidae      amongst
 the     Actiniaria.
      In    Sehizopathes       the three lobes        of the zooid in Parantipathe*
become        separated      from    each other      by    a further   depression     in   the
peristome, and also             by the formation of         a mesogloeal septum,       which
projects downwards              for  some distance from the base of the depres
sion towards         the skeletal sheath.          By    these means     each lobe   of    the
primitively simple zooid becomes separated                       from its neighbour in
the same          manner as the simple zooids of Aniipaihella, Paranti-
patheg,      ic.,  are separated from each other.                The three lobes of the
zooid     in Paraniipathes, having             become separated from each other in
Schizopathea         by the formation of vertical            mesogloeal partitions,      may
now be considered dimorphic                    forms.     The middle one containing
the stomodaeum,            which    opens by the mouth at the apex of an elon
gated       tubular projection, may be termed the gostrozooid, whilst the
two lateral         ones,   containing       the reproductive organs,         may be dis
 tinguished as gonozooids.               Each of the three dimorphic zooids bears
 a   pair of tentacles,        but the gostrozooid        is the only one possessing         a
 permanent opening              to the exterior.       In   Sehizopathes   the dimorphic
 individuals       are arranged       in  a single linear series along one aspect of
  a  branch    ;  all are in communication with one another through the
  bases of     their coelentera, and there is typically no isolation of the
  zooids into     triplets, but all are pressed closely together.           In  specimens
  in which the reproductive               elements    are well developed,       the gono
  zooids become          much distended, and the sequence of the dimorphic
  forms along a         branch is then readily recognised.              Using   the    letter
   R to represent the gonozooid and S the gastrozooid,                       the   arrange

  In Bathypathes the isolation of the dimorphic zooids,                                  each   bear
ing a pair of tentacles, might lead one to suggest quite a different
interpretation          if the intermediate           steps      in the differentiation ver*
not known.              It will,   however, be evident from the points already
indicated in outline, that the dimorphism in Antipathidse is brought
about — firstly, by an elongation of the zooid in the transverse axis                                    ;
and,       secondly, by the formation of two vertical constrictions                               and
mesogloeal         partitions by which the elongated                    zooid is divided          intr
three       portions, one          nutritive    and two             reproductive.         These      in
Bathypathes are frequently more isolated than are the unmodified
zooids of normal            types, and         have    as       much claim to rank as indi
viduals.
  I       have thus      been led to divide the family Antipathidse                       into two
sub-families, of which the following                     short diagnoses          will    serve    our

    In conclusion, attention       may be called         to the twofold      beariQg of
these    observations.     First, there is the interest attaching to the
fact  of the occurrence of a dimorphism resulting in the formation
of specialised nutritive and sexual individuals amongst the Anti-
patharia, such a condition having been hitherto unknown, not only
in   that   order,   but in    the    Zoantharia generally.              Secondly,    the
specialisation     resulting in dimorphism            takes a peculiar course, and
is probably connected       with the extension          of  a  colony in the direction
 of its branches.      The dimorphism of           the Schizopathince,        it is to be
 remembered,      is brought about by       the division of one primitive zooid
 into three, and not as in many             other     cases    by a specialisation of
 different   individuals.     It   thus ditfers      essentially      from the dimor
  phism of Jfadrejjora Durvillei        as   well    as  from that of the modified
 individuals which perform similar functions                  amongst the Hydroids.
  The Change in the Thermoelectric Properties of Wood's
         Fusible Metal at its Melting Point.                      By    Albert Camp
         bell, B.A.
                             (Read February 18, 1889. )
      The thermoelectric properties of tin, at temperatures below and
   above its melting point, were investigated by the writer about a
   year ago, and the results of the experiments                 were given in a paper
   read before this      Society.*     In    those     experiments,       however,    the
   height of the melting point of tin         made it impossible,         with mercury
   thermometers, to obtain anything but an approximate                     indication of
    the change in the thermoelectric properties                in passing the melting
    point.    In the present experiments,         therefore, Wood's fusible metal

    The chief difficulty with this alloy was its expansion after solidify
ing, which invariably shatters any glass vessel in which it is allowed
to cool down.        This difficulty  was avoided by using, instead      of  a
glass    tube, a thin  indiarubber   one, which was filled   with the alloy.
One end of this tube was bent up at right angles, and into the
fusible metal at that end of the tube a thin strip of iron (tin-plate)
was    inserted.    This junction    was   placed, beside   the bulb of a
 thermometer, in asbestos wool contained in copper cylinders sepa
 rated    from each other by layers of asbestos, and heated by a small
 spirit-lamp underneath.       The other ends of the iron strip and the
 fusible metal were joined to copper wires leading through a com
 mutator to a sensitive mirror galvanometer with a scale at          1 2 feet
 distance, and the junctions, well varnished, were immersed       in a  large
 can of cold water.       During   the sets of observations   (which lasted

from 7°-2 C. to          8°T C.        The readings     were all reduced    to 7°-2 C. by
a  suitable correction.
    For     each   reading the temperature of the hot junction was allowed
to rise      till almost perfectly           steady, and then four deflections taken
alternately to opposite sides of the scale.                 The mean of the four was
taken as the reading.                To keep the deflections well       on the scale the
      ativeness of the galvanometer was altered when the deflections
             large.       Thus three       sets of readings  [(A), (B), and (C) in     the
                      obtained.         These were pieced together by making one
                    (B) lie on the curve          got from set  (A),  and then reducing
                         numbers        in  set  (B) in  the same proportion.       Then
               was     pieced on         to (B) in a similar manner.          The points
               * in the table were those by which the
  marked                                                          joining was effected,
         course,  they are omitted in the diagram.
       The table gives         in the     second column the temperature        of the hot
    Miction, and        in the third column          the observed deflections reduced
  to     cold-junction-temperature 7°-2 C.               It was found that up to at
                                 ;tions (D) agreed very nearly with the formula
                                       D = 33-62(<-7-2),
   I being      the temperature of the hot            junction;  so that the curve is a
   straight line.         From     74°"4 C. up to 150° C. the readings agree very
   fairly with the formula
                              D=      -•1348*2 + 79-22*- 2879,

                                             r=293Q-8.
    Toe last two         columns in the table give the values of D calculated
     from the two formulae           above.     The curve in the diagram is from the
     second and     third columns.           At  8° C. the position of the line of thin
     alloy in the      thermoelectric diagram is between           the iron and copper
     lines.
          In conclusion, we see from the above formula; that from 7° C. up

   The History and Theory of Heredity.                           By  J. Arthur
                             Thomson, Esq., M.A.
                              (Read Jannary 21, 1889.)
   The   present paper has a three-fold object : — (1) to give a history
of the    theories of heredity -which         have   been proposed      by so many
naturalists,     with an appreciation of these in the light of recent
advances;      (2) to gather together        the various contributions         which
have made the modern           restatement     possible   ; (3) to enter a    protest
against what the author believes to be the extreme                       position   so
firmly maintained by Weismann,              to whom, however, much of the
recent progress has been due.            An historical review is       necessary   (in
Britain    at least) both as a contribution        to the general history of the
science,   and as a basis      for further construction        ; the accumulating
mass of recent literature        makes     a collation     desirable  ; the  import
ance of Weismann's position           in relation    to the Theory of     Evolution
makes criticism imperative.
                         L The Facts of Inheritance.
    It  is   necessary,    at the outset, to summarise           what are usually
regarded as the principal facts of inheritance.              (1) The general like
ness between parent and offspring is a commonplace of observation,
condensed     in the familiar saying,     "Like   begets   like."   (2) But besides
the general      resemblance,     which expresses the relative constancy of
the species,      a   particular   similarity    is often     demonstrable.       The
offspring reproduces        not only the general features, but often minute
characteristics of the parent.           (3) In very many instances the off
 spring exhibits, not parental,         so much as grandfatherly character
istics, e.g., in the familiar phenomena of atavism.                    (4) "Without
 entering debatable        ground, we must further note the fact of the
frequent recurrence of the pathological characters of the parent in
 the constitution of the offspring.           (5) But the fact in regard to the
 explanation      of which      most    debate at present obtains, is that
characters      individually acquired by the            parent    as the results of
 environmental or of functional influence, certainly reappear, whether
 they be transmitted or not, in the offspring.
    Denials of      these  Facts. — Now, while the resemblance              between

offspring and parent,            both in general      and in particular,      alike in
normal and         in pathological characteristics,          cannot   be denied as a
fact,   it  has often been denied as the result of transmission.                   Such
denials have varied greatly in degree and motive, and some                      of the
most important may thus be classified.
    1.   Denial of any transmission, on               philosophical grounds ;        e.g.T
 Wollaston.
    2.   Denial of the transmission of individual characteristics                ;  e.y.r
 Bonnet.
    3.   Denial of the transmission of psychical individual                 character
istics   ;  e.g., Buckle.
    4.   Denial of the transmission of characters individually                acquired
 by the     " body   "
                         of the parent      in course of function, or impressed
 upon the same by the environment                  ; His and     others, but   notably
 Weismann.
    Of     those denials the         only one of serious importance         is that    of
 Weismann, which             will    be separately      considered   later on.     The
 truth which the others more or less clearly suggest is the influence
 of similar conditions of function                 and    environment    in evolving
 resemblances,         without     there   being any real       transmission of the
 same.       This    all   naturalists will allow, while at the same               time
 refusing to believe         that similar conditions are sufficient to account
 for the greater part of the result.              Of   course,  if we push back far
 enough and include in the similar conditions the specific                   constants
 in the history of the germ-cells,             in the mechanics of development,
 and in the life of the embryo,              the denial becomes more       reasonable,
 though more truistic.
                             II.  Problems      ok   Heredity.
    There are three general              problems of heredity, which          must     be
  carefully distinguished,          as has not   always been done.
     1.    In what    consists the unique character         of the germ-cells?
     2.    Granted the unique character of the germ, what are the con
             ditions of its reconstruction of the parent           1
     3.    In what way is       the reappearance      of individual peculiarities,     as
             opposed to that of the general features,            to be interpreted   ?
  In other words         (1)  it is   necessary   to  understand in what way the
  germ-cell      of plant or animal comes to be such a marvellous unit

organism.         (2) Understanding the uniqueness of the germ-cell as

         III.  Theories of the Uniqueness              op  the Germ-Cells.
      1.  Jfygtical   Hypotheses. — The theories of heredity, like so many
 others, exhibit three          phases — theological, metaphysical,        and more
 or less scientific.       "We need not discuss the possession          of the germs
 by spirits, nor yet the postulates of vires        formativae, nisus formativus,
 principle of heredity, Vererbungskraft or Bildungstrieb, but begin
  with the gradual emergence of the theories of heredity into fuller
  scientific daylight.        It is necessary, however, to linger for a little
  over       the so-called mystical hypotheses of the uniqueness of
  the germ-cells.        They only require to be stated.               According to
   Haller,     Bonnet,    and others,    the seed, egg, or male element con
   tained an excessively minute micro-organism, a complete though
   miniature model of the adult. This is stimulated out of potential
   life in fertilisation, and with the absorption of nutriment in its
   interstices,     unfolds   or   expands into      the adult      organism.     The
    animalculists     found    this    miniature  model in the        male   element,
    which was nourished           by the ovum, while the           ovists   held that
    the model      lay in nuce within         the egg,    and was,     so to    speak,
    awakened       by   the  sperm.      This hypothesis was further'          backed
                        " emboitement," according to which the germ
    up    by that of                                                               was
    not only itself a marvellous micro-organism, but contained in                 ever
    smaller proportions, after the manner of an infinite juggler's box,
    the     miniature   models    of the generations to        follow.     The   germ
     was thus, as they said,      like  a bud to be unfolded        with every part
     ready made or preformed, and all in perfect transparency.
                                                                             " Es gibt
     kein Werden," said Haller, and his preformation theory certainly
     disposed at once of development and of the problems of heredity.
     But, at the same time, the germ was          far more than a bud — it had
     imprisoned    within it the buds of all its     descendants.

:>4                    Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                               [sesa.
      It    is    of   course      evident, to be quite fair, that in their                        general
proposition             that the germ was a potential organism, the preforma-
tionists were             quite correct.            Their theory          was     metaphysical,         but
it    was at least        an advance           on the more          archaic theological             theory
of possession             by spirits.          The objection of to-day is simply that                         a
model, in the strict sense of the term, does not exist in the genu.
The early researches                   of Wolff alone wore               quite sufficient to show
that neither the hypothesis                       of preformation                nor its consequent
hypothesis of             " emboitement"              had    any    basis of fact.           From this
point, therefore, a new start was made.
      2.     Special      Pangenetic           Theories.     — Passing from the mystical
hypotheses,             we come to a whole series                   of theories, which are in
varying            degrees      scientific,     and    may     be       fairly    enough       described
by         the general          designation pangenetic.                 They      all   have       this in
common             that they seek to explain the uniqueness                         of the germ-cell
by regarding it               as    a centre   of contributions from different parts of
the organism.
   Early Forms. — I shall briefly pass over the earlier and vaguer
forms of this supposition. At such different epochs as are suggested
by the            names       of Democritus            and    Hippocrates,          Paracelsus        and
Maupertius, incipient theories of pangenesis                            — prophecies of Darwin's
                                                                                                          "
— were            suggested.         Thus Democritus maintained that the "seed
of animals was elaborated                       by contributions           from all parts of the
body,            and   that        the constituent          parts reproduced their                 several
origins.           Two millennia later Buffon, of                   whose        speculation Darwin
appears           at first to have        been        unaware,      again        regards     the    germs
as     mingled extracts from all parts of the body, or                                  as   collections
of samples from the various organs.                           If    such were indeed the cast.
Buffon and his predecessors                     saw no further            difficulty, for each con
tributed sample produced                   in the embryo            a   structure like its parental
origin.
      Spencer's        Theory. — In
                               in his Principles of Biology, Herbert
                                           18G-1,
Spencer suggested the existence of " physiological units," derived
from and capable                    of development into cells,1 and supposed                         their
accumulation in the reproductive elements, which thus become, in
some conceivable sense, micro-organisms.
   Darwin's Theory of Pangenesis. — The best known theory of this
class   of course, the " provisional hypothesis of pangenesis" sug
            is,

gested by Darwin in his           Variation     of Animals and Plant* under
Domestication.          The chief      suggestions     of this     theory    are   well
known to      be as  follows : —
  (1) Every cell of the body, not             too highly      differentiated, throws
          off characteristic gemmules ;
  (2) These multiply by fission, retaining their characteristics ;
  (3) They become specially concentrated                     in the reproductive
          elements    ;
  (4)  In   development the gemmules              unite    with   others  like them
          selves, and grow into cells like          those   from which they were
          originally given off.
    The applications of this, in         one sense very satisfactory theory,          t<>
the phenomena of atavism, and reappearance                    of similar   characters
at similar times, do not concern us in this general survey.
   Jayer'n Theory. — The next theory              is somewhat difficult        to sum
marise, partly because of its technical character,                partly because the
author does not appear to be quite consistent in his statement                    of it
at different times.       The main points, under the present section, arc
as follows    : —
  (1) Each organ and tissue            contains,    along with the molecules of
          its albumen,     a specific   "scent-stuff"     (Duft-und-AViirzestofF).
  (2) In hunger and similar           experience      the albumen liberates the
          " scent-stuff," which       penetrates     through the body         as  fatty
          acids, ethers, &c.
  (3) These      are specially attracted      to the reproductive cells, which,
        . when     mature,   are thus specialised by the reception           of scent-
          stuff, and have in their protoplasm vires fonnativse enough
          to reproduce     a new organism like the parent.
    It will   be seen later on that this hypothesis of chemical pan
genesis is not the most important contribution                 made by the author
to the theory of heredity.
    Galttin's modified Theory of Pangenesis. — From experiments on
the transfusion of blood, Galton was led to conclude that "the
doctrine of pangenesis,        pure and simple, is incorrect."           But    he did
 more than urge serious objections against              Darwin's theory      ; ho   for
 mulated one of his own, to which, with the exception of Professor
 Herdman,       subsequent    investigators do not appear to me to have

attached      sufficient importance.               The very important                          part of      Galton's
theory will be discussed in its proper place                            ;   it    is not       included in          the
series of pangenetic               hypotheses.     fact, one of the
                                                          Galton                Ls,   in
numerous biologists who have suggested the continuity of the ger
minal protoplasm.   He     included at this stage, however, because
                                        is
he admitted as    subsidiary hypothesis
                        a                  limited amount of pan    a
genesis.       To account for those cases which suggest                                        that      characters
acquired by the individual                     parent are "faintly             heritable," Galton
supposed      that "each cell may throw off                         a   few germs that find their
way into the circulation, and have thereby                                  a   chance of          occasionally
finding their way to the sexual elements, and of becoming natiiralised
among them."            This part of his theory                is   obviously              a   cautious admis
sion of limited pangenesis to account for                      a    limited number                  of doubtful
cases.
     Brooks' Tlieory. — In 1883, in his valuable work entitled                                            The Lair
of Heredity, Professor W. K. Brooks                        gave         full          expression      to a modi
fication of Darwin's view of pangenesis.                            The main positions, which
are    here   relevant, may be summarised                           as       follows,           almost      in   the
author's words      : —
 (1) The male and female cells are specialised                                   in different directions;
       their union gives variability.
 (2) The ovum             is   a   cell which has gradually                            acquired       a   compli
           cated organisation, and which                     contains material particles                         of
           some     kind       to correspond          to each of the hereditary charac
           teristics of the species.
 (3) The ovum reproducing its like, as other cells, gives rise not
       only to the divergent cells of the organism, but also to cells
           like itself.
 (4) Each       cell of        the body         has    the     power to throw off minute
           germs.       When,           through       a   change            in its environment, its
           functions are disturbed, and its conditions                                         of life    become
           unfavourable,           it   throws off small particles which                                  are the
           germs or gemmules                 of this particular cell.
 (5) These        germs may be carried to all parts of the body.                                            They
           may penetrate           to an ovarian ovum or to                           a    bud, but the     male
           cell has gradually            acquired,        as    its especial                   and distinctive
           function,    a   peculiar power to gather and store up germs.
 (6)     In fertilisation       each gemmule unites with that particle of the

1 8*8—89.]          Mr    J. A. Thomson on Theory of Heredity.                              97
             ovum which is destined to give rise in the offspring to the
             cell which corresponds to the one which produced the gem-
              mule, or else it unites with a closely-related particle, destined
              to give rise to a closely-related cell.            Such a cell       will  be a
              hybrid, tending to vary.
   (7) As the ovarian ova of the offspring                 share by direct inheritance
               all the properties of the fertilised ovum, the organisms to
               which they give rise will tend to vary in the same way.
    (8)    A     cell   which    has thus      varied will      continue     to throw       off
               gemmules, and         thus to transmit         variability    to   the   corre
               sponding      part in the bodies of successive              generations of
               descendants until a favourable variation                is seized upon by
               natural selection.
   (9) As the ovum which produced this                          selected    organism will
               transmit the       same    variation    to  its ovarian ova by direct
               inheritance,    the characteristic     will   be established as specific,
               and transmitted henceforth without              gemmules.
       The above theory, being important, has been stated at some length.
  Apart from the suggestion of variation as due to sexual intermingling,
  with which 4WeiEmann has made us more familiar ; apart, too, from
  the suggestion of germinal continuity, the credit of which Brooks
   shares, there are several           important     points to be emphasised            in  the
   modification          proposed.     It   is in unwonted        and abnormal          condi
   tions that the cells of the body throw off                    gemmules.         The male
    elements are the special centres of their accumulation                    ;  the female
     it is that      keeps   up the general resemblance           between offspring and
     parent.
         It  is not proposed to enter into criticism of pangenesis                   theories.
      The best criticism        is found in that abandonment of special hypo
      theses which recent advances            have rendered possible.           It  has often
       been   urged that the hypothesis of pangenesis               involves not one but
       many    suppositions —that it       is just as difficult      to understand why          a
        genimule should reproduce a cell            like its own origin         as to under
        stand   the entire problem, and so on.              Detailed criticism         will   be
        found    in the works of Galton, Ribot, Brooks, Henlman,                        Plarre,
        and others.      It  is enough for us to          emphasise       the comparative
         gratuitousness    of any special theory whatever,            a paradox which          is
         explained  in the succeeding      section.

                            Germinal Continuity.
    As far back      as  1849, Owen pointed out in his paper on Par
thenogenesis      that in the developing germ         it was possible to distin
guish between cells which became much changed to form the body,
and cells which remained little changed and formed the reproductive
organs.      This  was probably the earliest distinct         suggestion     of the
modern theory of germinal continuity.
    In    1866, in his      classic   Generelle    Morphologic,      Haeckol em
phasised     the    simple and yet fundamental fact of the material
continuity of offspring and parent.             In  a historical note      upon the
distinction     between the "personal" and "germinal"                  parts of an
organism,      Rauber    states   that   the distinction     was     proposed      by
Haeckel in 1874, and by himself in            1879.
    J tiger stated the doctrine of germinal continuity           very clearly and
concisely at an early date       :—
                                     " Through    a great series   of generations
the germinal protoplasm retains           its specific   properties,   dividing in
every reproduction       into an ontogenetic portion, out of which                the
individual is built     up, and a phylogenetic        portion which is reserved
to form the reproductive material of the mature offspring.                      This
reservation of the phylogenetic material          I described as the      continuity
    tlie germ protoplasm."                  " Encapsuled in the
of                                                                      ontogenetic
material,    the phylogenetic       protoplasm     is sheltered from        external
influences,    and retains its specific and embryonic characters."
    Brooks notes that, in papers published in 1876 and 1877, he had
also suggested      the notion of germinal continuity, and the concep
tion is clearly expressed       in his work already quoted : — " The ovum
gives rise to the divergent cells of the organism, but also to cells
like itself. The ovarian ova of the offspring are these latter cells,
or their direct unmodified descendants.               The   ovarian ova of the
offspring share by direct inheritance all the properties of the fertilised
ovum."
    The important theory of Galton now requires notice.                   Two pre
liminary notes are requisite.         Galton is extremely doubtful in regard
to the genuine transmission of acquired characters.               It  is to account
for the possible faint inheritance of some of these                  that he     still
admits, as a subsidiary hypothesis,         a limited amount of pangenesis.

In   the second place,       it is needful to notice at the outset Galton's
term    " stirp," -which he uses to express the sum total of the germs,
gemmules,       or organic units of        some kind, which       are to be found    in
the   newly-fertilised ovum.
  (1)  Only some of the          germs     within    the stirp attain development
          in the      cells of the        " body."      It  is the dominant     germs
          which so develop.
 <2)   The residual germs                and    their   progeny form       the sexual
          elements or buds.           The part of the stirp developed into the
           " body " is almost sterile.           The continuity is kept up by      the
           undeveloped       residual portion.
  (3) The        direct   descent    is    not between        body   and    body,  but
           between      stirp and stirp.
                                                 " The stirp of    the child   may bo
           considered      to have descended          directly from a part of the
           stirps of each of its parents, but then the personal structure
           of the child is no more than an imperfect representation of
            his own stirp, and           the   personal    structure of each of the
            parents is no more than an imperfect representation of each
            of their own stirps."
  Here    it will   be seen that there        is a very definite expression     of the
  notion that the germinal cells of the offspring are in very direct
  continuity with those of the parents.                 The antithesis between     the
   " soma" and the chain of sex-cells is
                                                    emphasised.
      The history      must   also include Nussbaum, who called emphatic
   attention to the very early differentiation and isolation of the sex-
   elements to be observed       in  some cases.      The theory both of Jager and
   of Nussbaum is that of a continuity of germinal cells.                  The theory
   of "Weismann       is more    strictly that of the continuity          of germinal
   protoplasm.        The position of Jager and Nussbaum may first be
   summarised       more definitely    : —
     (1)  At    an  early stage     in    the   embryo,     the future   reproductive
             cells  of the organism are distinguishable from those which
             are forming the body.
     (2)  The latter develop in manifold variety, and                 lose almost   all
             likeness to the mother germ.
                         —                                      —
     (3) The former the reproductive rudiments are not implicated
             in the differentiation of the "soma," remain virtually un
             changed,    continue the protoplasmic tradition unaltered.

  (4) The sex-cells       of the offspring being thus continuous with the
           parental sex-cells which give rise to itself, they             will in turn
           develop into similar products.
   Now this fact of continuity of reproductive                elements   is obviously
most satisfactory.         If  a  fertilised     egg-cell  has   certain characters,
x, y, z,  it develops    into an organism in which these characters x, y, z
are expressed ; but, at the same time, the future                 reproductive cells
are   early set apart,       retaining     the characters      x, y, z in all their
entirety, to start a new organism again with the same capital.                     Bal-
biani, who was not influenced by theoretical considerations, observed
in Chironomus that the future reproductive cells were isolated before
even     the blastoderm was         completed;        that is to say, before        any
differentiation      almost had occurred,         a portion   of the unadulterated
ovum was insulated to continue the constancy of the species.
   In this     aspect the reproductive           cells form a continuous         chain,
and the reproduction of like is as natural and necessary as                  it was   in
the Protozoa.         No special theory is required.             Similar conditions
produce similar results.         Unfortunately,        however,  a serious difficulty
besets this      easy theory.      Such      an early     appearance    and insula
tion of the reproductive cells, continuous with the very ovum itself,
does indeed occur,         and where      it  does the problem of heredity             is
simple.      Early origin of special germ-cells, distinguished from those
of the general " body," has been observed in some " worm-types "
(leeches, Sagitta, threadworms, many Polyzoa) and                  in  some    Arthro
pods (Moina         among crustaceans,         not    a  few insects,    Phalangidap
among spiders), while indications             of the     same early separation are
not wanting in a number of other organisms.                     But it must     be dis
tinctly allowed that in         most   cases    it is only after differentiation is
relatively advanced that the future reproductive cells make their
appearance.       Thus we     have to pass from the few cases as yet known
of the continuity of the germinal cells, to the more' general, but less
 luminous, fact of the "continuity of the germ-plasma."

tinuity between         the reproductive          elements    of   generations,     the
solution of likeness must be found.                 But  a direct chain    of cellular
continuity can only be said to exist in a few cases.                   The solution
which is proposed for the majority of cases is as follows               : —

                 V. Elaborations          op      Doctrine of Continuity.
   It   may now be concluded that in the more or less strict continuity
of the   successive           sets of reproductive         elements       lies the solution of
the main problem of heredity.                      This   appears     the most convenient
place to notice the various suggestions                    made as to what          it   is   exactly
that    is   continuous.           The earlier of these suggestions             were brought
forward          indeed before        the notion       of continuity         had its present
definite form, but           I     have deemed       it   better to^introduce them here
than to mix them up with the pangenetic                         series.
   In the simplest animals, organism A buds and hands on a fraction
of its living matter to A', surely A' being so really continuous with
A, must grow into      form like its origin.
                               a              But while emphasising
that the explanation of the similarity lies in                     the continuity,        we may
probe further into the continuity itself, and express                          it   in chemical,
physical, or even psychical terms.
   So with higher organisms.                   A   germ    x develops into          a   body, and
the reproductive cells thereof.                   The latter arise in such          a    way that
they     are      virtually continuous             with the undifferentiated original
germ x.           They retain its constitution             intact, become the starting
points of new organisms,                which from similar origins are naturally
similar in result.             The whole   emphasis        is   laid on the notion of con
tinuity, but       it   is   necessary to consider the attempted analyses                      made
at different       levels.

England      suggested         about the same time a psychical aspect                                of the
hereditary continuity.                   The two suggestions              may be so far     summed
up together.             Memory is a general                   function of         organised mat
and the reproduction of parental likeness is the result of                                unconscious
recollectionof the past.                     What      are ordinarily      called memory,            habit,
instinct,    and embryonic                     reconstruction       are    all     referable        to the
memory       of living matter.                     Hering finds the          basis          uncon

scious memory            in   the persistence              of the undulatory         movements sup
posed to be characteristic of the molecules.                              These undulations              are
sensitive to change, and room                         is thus left for variability,            but their
tendency        to persist      in their established harmony is the                            basis of
heredity.

from the ancestral            cell       to the entire group of cells, assumes                  in both
cases the same           form of         a     branching wave-motion."                 "The true and

tion of the organic molecules                          or plastidules."          The tendency that
this periodic motion has to persist,                           preserving     as   it   were   a    charac
teristic rhythm, explains the relative constancy                                 of ordinary inherit
ance, while at the same time                         the     results of new experience             may be
added       on to the dominant                      molecular movement.                 In very simple
organisms,       as he says,            the plastidules have, so to speak, learned little
and forgotten nothing,                   while in highly perfected                   types   the plasti
dules have both learned and forgotten much.                                  Haeckel thus empha
sises on the one              hand       the psychical, on the other the physical or
molecular aspect of the real continuity.

    Jager    regards    the continuity    in cellular terma      It  is a proto
plasmic continuity effected after the ordinary fashion of cell-division.
To this there      has to be added his chemical conception of pangenesis,
¦which when expressed          in  more modern phraseology is reasonable
enough — being simply the supposition that characteristic anastates
and     katastates   find their way to the reproductive elements,             and
make these to some limited extent still sharers           in the general   life of
the organism.
    Galton does not make the continuity much more precise than is
implied in      the general  statement    that a residue of the germs, gem-
mules, or organic units in the "stirp," remaining latent in the con
struction of     the body, are passed on into the reproductive elements,
and keep up a continuity between " stirp" and " stirp." In regard
to the future history of the gemmules, Galton supposes that they
form groups in the ovum, and become directly associated with
its division, while at later      stages they wander and give rise to new
 cells.    To obviate histological      difficulties,  Herdman    proposes     the
 following     reasonable   amendment,      "that the body of the new in
dividual is formed, not by the development of gemmules alone and
 independently into cells, but by the gemmules in the cells causing,
by their affinities and repulsions,      these cells so to divide and redivide
as to give rise to new cells, tissues, and organs."          All this admits of
more direct expression in terms of "chemical pangenesis."                Brooks
and Nussbaum rest satisfied in maintaining a cellular continuity.
    What     keeps up the continuity,         according to Weismann, is the
keimplasma, i.e., a special portion of the nuclei of the reproductive
cells, which with great morphological stability            keeps  itself intact,
and is sooner       or later once more       established  in the reproductive
cells of the growing organism.            Nageli finds sufficient explanation
of the constancy of inheritance in the individuality and             persistence
(Beharrungsgesetz)       of what he calls the " idioplasma."
   Kblliker, 0. Hertwig, Strasburger, and Bambeke             may be noted for
the emphasis which they have laid upon the nuclei as transmitting
or rather continuing the essential         characteristics from generation      to
generation.       Thanks   to the researches of such investigators as Van
Beneden and Boveri, it is now certain that the male and female

of the ovum.        Nay   more, each of the first two daughter-cells has in

throughout.
   Most hopefully,          perhaps,        has the continuity             been expressed           by
several, e.g.,      Berthold, Qautier, and Geddes, in chemical terms.                               In
the paper by the last mentioned on                      "Growth, Sex, Reproduction, and
Heredity,"         the following     weighty sentence              occurs:   — "If the repro
ductive elements start with a specific protoplasm continuous with that
of the combined mother ovum and fertilising sperm                            — that      is,   with a
concentrated accumulation of characteristic anastates and katastates
— the simple fact that            the products of protoplasmic change must be
fixed, definite, and continuous,                   as   in all chemical       processes,        gives
us at once     a    protoplasmic basis from which to explain the constant
and    necessary      symmetry of segmentation and development."                                 The
views of Berthold           are closely similar.              Inheritance        is   possible only
on the basis of the fundamental fact that in the chemical processes
of the organism            "the   same          substances    and mixtures of substances
are reproduced            in quantity and quality with regular periodicity."
Gautier discusses both variation and heredity from                           a    chemical point
of view.         " The force which maintains the                   species, and gives          it   the
 character of constancy and resistance,                       is   nothing       more than the
 resultant of the forces which maintain the chemical species of which
 the organism        is   composed."

      The doctrine of the continuity                     of the reproductive            protoplasm
 obviously answers           not only the first problem of the uniqueness of
 the germ-cell, but         it   casts          new light upon the problem of recon
 struction.         The                  is a                  and,     to        certain      extent,

 up an embryo in the precise way in which     does     Because    is

 cisely similar fashion.            Thus the question               ceases to be particular,
 and becomes general — ceases, in fact, to be                      a    problem in heredity,
 and    becomes       a    subject for investigation               under the mechanics of
 development

tions of His, Bauber, and                     others,     there    are few general           facts on
¦which        one can find foothold               for further         construction.          Yet the
task has been more than begun in the experimental investigations of
O. Hertwig, Fol, Pfliiger, Born, Roux, Schultze, Gerlach, and others.
Observations as to the actual dynamics of cell division — such,
for instance, as those of Van Beneden and Boveri, — are beginning
to appear; while the title of Berthold's book on "Protoplasmic
Mechanics" shows how the biologist begins to seek the aid of
the       student of physics in explaining                     the architecture of the            living
organism.            But     we are at present           only concerned      in emphasising
that  the conception of development as                         what Pfliiger called " organic
                "
crystallisation   must become dominant.                            The laws of growth which
express        the    mode      in which       each fertilised        egg-cell    must undergo
segmentation, gastrulation, and the like have to be expressed                                         in
terms of the internal and external physico-chemical conditions.
     "To       think that heredity               will build organic              beings      without
mechanical           means is a piece of unscientific mysticism," as Professor
His     noted in his valuable paper recently submitted to this Society,
and yet        the tendency does not rapidly disappear from even scientific
literature.          It    is impossible, for instance,            to exaggerate        the import
ance of the general               conclusion variously expressed                  by Von Baer,
 Spencer, and Haeckel, that the life-history of the individual                                     is a
 recapitulation of the evolution of the race. To say that ontogeny
                                  " the microcosm of the
 recapitulates phylogeny, or that                        ontogenetic
 tree is a reflection of the macrocosm                        of the genealogical       tree," is to
 express       a marvellous         generalisation.             But what    we     now wish           to
 understand          is,   as Hallez expresses          it,   how the protoplasm          is   at each
 stage the      architect as well as the material of its own development.
 The metaphors suggest                  that the developing organism has somehow
 a   feeling for history, or that the dead hand of the                           past   is   literally
  upon       the present, while our aim must be to get beyond any mere
  phrase      of organic        memory,       and to understand the chemical and
  physical conditions which, more                  or less modified in the course of
  history,     must still be present to rule the development.                             There can
   be   no   doubt that, in the modern theory of continuity, there                           is   found
  the   reconciliation between those who maintain that the likeness of
  ofepring      to parent      is   due to the presence of similar conditions                       and

                 VII. Inheritance of Acquired Characters.
                                                   concerned the
     The third problem, which we stated at the outset,
inheritance of acquired characters. It is well known that many
organisms in the course of their individual life are affected by
environmental influences, or by use and disuse of their   organs.
Environmental and functional variations of the body of the indi
vidual organism thus result.                 The question         is,   whether these            may
be transmitted         to the offspring by the parent which acquires                         them.
Two cautions         may be        noted in starting — (1) No naturalist
                                                                doubts
the inheritance of constitutional or organismal variations.      These
may bo reasonably traced back to the fertilised egg-cell.    But what
is involved in the fertilised egg-cell   also, by hypothesis, involved
                                                       is
in the germ-cells whicli give rise to the next generation.    There                                is
no argument on tliis fact             ;   the present       scepticism      relates     to   func
tional     and    environmental           variations.     (2) No one doubts                   that
functional       and environmental              variations often reappear.                   Many
doubt, however,         that they reappear             because   they have been              trans
mitted.      Another         alternative     is   obviously      open.      The       conditions
which originally         brought about            a   given change may still persist,
and    may hammer the              same     effect upon the offspring which                   they
wrought upon the parent.
     Doubt   as to tho       transmission of acquired characters                 is   not novel.
It   has, however,      become        precise in Weismann's              statement.          Brock
has noticed that even               the editor, whoever he was,                  of Aristotle's
Historia AnimaJium             seems to have differed            from his master on this
subject.      Aristotle       naively refers          to the inheritance of the exact
shape of     a    certain cautery;         but tho editor seems to doubt whether
apparent instances of the inheritance of acquired characters are not,
after all,       exceptional.         The    same       writer   notes     Kant's       vigorous
opinion      against    the transmission of such individual                      features,    and
also Blumenbach's cautious                 inclination      to the      same position.           In
 more recent times,          His    expressed     his strong conviction against such
inheritance      ;   and Galt-on     is   at once cautious and emphatic.                 Pfliiger
is    also among       the    earlier sceptics.         A   few sentences from Galton,

 whose merit has           not been sufficiently        emphasised,      may be quoted.
 The inheritance          of characters acquired during             the lifetime    of the
             "
parents         includes much questionable             evidence,     usually difficult of
verification.        We might almost         reserve our belief that the structural
cells can       react on the sexual elements              at all, and we may be con
fident that at the most they do so in a very faint degree — in other
¦words,    that acquired modifications            are barely,     if  at all, inherited in
the correct sense          of that word."
  ( 1)   In regard to climatic variations, Galton doubts any reaction of
            the    " body "    upon the germs, but believes that the germs are
            themselves        directly affected.
  (2)    The      same     is  true in many constitutional           diseases   that have
            been acquired by long-continued irregular habits.
   (3) The cases of the apparent inheritance of mutilations                       are  out
             numbered         by the overpowering negative             evidence   of their
             non-inheritance.
    (4) The case of Brown-Sequard's              hereditarily epileptic guinea-pigs,
               in consequence of       an operation performed upon the parents,
               is perhaps interpretable as the result of imitative influence.
     (5)  It    is hard to       find evidence     of the power of the personal
              structure to react upon sexual elements, that is not open to
              serious objection.       That which      appears the most trustworthy
              lies   almost      wholly in the direction of           nerve   changes,   as
               shown by the inherited habits of tameness, pointing in dogs,
               and the results of     Dr Brown-Sequard.
       Weismann,         however, has brought          the scepticism to a climax.
    He denies all inheritance of acquired characters, a denial which at
    the present day should be welcome              to optimists.         Weismann finely
    no convincing       evidence that characters impressed            upon the parental
    organism       by the surroundings, or acquired          as  the result of use and
    disuse, can      be transmitted.       The   case    is not proven.        More than
    that,   however, Weisniann's          whole theory of variation, adaptation,
    and    heredity      raises,   he believes,  strong probabilities         against the
    inheritance      of acquired characters.         It   is necessary to quote a few
    of his sentences.
        (1) "Acquired characters are those which result from external
     influence upon the organism, in contrast to such as spring from the
     constitution     of the germ."

108           Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                   [sess.
        " Characters     can only be inherited in so far as        their rudiments
   (2)
(anlagen)    are    already given      in   the germinal       protoplasm     (keim-
plasma)."
        " Modifications which        are wrought upon the        formed body, in
   (3)
consequence      of external     influences, must remain           limited to      the
organism in which they arose."
        " So must it      be  with mutilations, and with the results of            use
   (4)
or disuse of parts of the body."
        " No such modifications of            the soma                 by environ
   (5)                                                     (affected
ment   or by use and disuse) can be transmitted to the germ-cells,
from which the next generation springs.                  They are, therefore, of
no account in the modification of the species."
        " The only principle that remains for the
   (6)                                                        explanation of the
modification of the species, is direct germinal variation."                      The
intermingling      of the sex elements is the origin of the variations,
on which natural selection in the usual way operates.
   Weismann's        position is thus clear and definite.          The sole foun
tain of     specific    change    is   found    in   the   intermingled     nuclear
plasma    of the sex-cells.       The environment does make             dints  upoD
the   organism,      but only     upon its     soma  ;  the reproductive       cells,
through     which     alone    the   variation     could    be   transmitted,     are
unaffected.     The effects of use and disuse may be marked enough,
and important for the individual,           but they are not transmitted, and
therefore of no account in the history of the species.                The   ground
is taken from under         the feet of Lamarckians         and Buffonians, and
the whole burden of          progress    is laid upon germinal        variation    in
sexual reproduction, and upon natural selection.
   And   as to the alleged      cases of the inheritance of acquired           char
acters in which wo and our fathers have believed, they usually admit
of one of three rebuffs.        They may be entirely fictitious or in          some
cases mere coincidences.         The inheritance of       a  letter branded ujwn
the arm, which Aristotle        notes, is an extreme      type of what     His  calls
a handful of anecdotes.        Or the apparent inheritance of acquired char
acters may be explained in this way ; similar surroundings hammer
the same      change     upon    successive     generations,     and we     mistake
reappearance      for transmission.        The case of Xiigeli's Alpine plants
which seemed         to have    been    thoroughly     changed,     but  lost their
 characters   when the influencing         conditions wore removed,        is often

      Not only has this conclusion               as to the non-inheritance              of acquired
  charactersrun counter to the presuppositions of many naturalists,
  not to speak of the laity, but if it is true, it literally takes the
  ground        from under the feet of those who have based                           their theory
  of evolution upon the postulate that organisms could hand on                                       as
  a   legacy        their individually        acquired gains.             Weismann's            theory,

               The latter especially gives numerous examples to prove the
               untenability of Weismann's                   position.        To      some       of the
               instances urged against him, Weismann                       has replied      ;    but as
               each    case has to be carefully tried               on its own merits, and
               as    sufficient    decisive    experiments          are   still   awanting,         the
               matter lies beyond the sphere of the present paper.
        (2)   Virchow has urged against Weismann what appear to him
               to be cases of the direct inheritance of climatic changes                           and
               pathological        variations.        But    he     appears to          differ    from
               Weismann          in his definition       of acquired         characters, which
               for the latter do not include anything that can reasonably be
               traced back to       a   germinal variation.         Ziegler has discussed the
               whole question of the inheritance of pathological characters,
               and comes to         a    conclusion     harmonious          with that of Weis
               mann.       Nor     are    the slow results of             acclimatisation          good

         cases     in  the   present discussion,        since Weismann         expressly
         allows tbat in long-continued             conditions affecting the whole
         system       the germinal       cells may be directly affected            along
         with,      though     not   exactly by, the other elements of the
         organism.
  (3)  A criticism of      a different nature has been suggested             by several,
         but is well stated          by Eimer.         If  the source      of variation
         be restricted by hypothesis to the keimplasma                     intermingled
         in  sexual      reproduction, is this sufficient to account for the
         facts   1
                      " In what     way, one must ask,          have    new characters
         first been introduced into the series               1  The sexual mixture
         could produce nothing           ;   it could only work with what was
         already given."           Professor M'Kendrick has forcibly empha
         sised a similar       objection.       There is no doubt, at any rate,
         that Weismann's theory, which excludes the direct assistance
         of environmental and functional                  variations, throws a still
         heavier burden than Darwin did on the shoulders of Natural
         Selection, which many believe to be already somewhat over
         weighted.
    Without urging        concrete   cases,   in regard to which one cannot but
allow the necessity of fresh observation              ;  without     venturing on the
pathological field where authorities               like Virchow and Ziegler so
much differ    ;   without    urging difficulties from the general theory              of
evolution,   I  wish to emphasise what appears to me to be the physio
logical compromise at present              tenable.      Does the doctrine of the
continuity of the reproductive protoplasm really force one to deny
the transmission of acquired characters?                  Stable and persistent as
the keimplasma may be, can one believe that                      it  leads   a charmed
life in the general symbiosis of the organism               1  Are the reproductive
cells in so rigid a degree        insulated from the general life ?
  (1) Every one allows the general conception of the various organs
         as symbions in a common life.                We constantly speak of cor
         related variations, and though these generally work from the
         centre      or germinal plasma outwards, there is no a                  priori
         improbability        against an environmental             influence of some
         strength saturating through              the entire organism, affecting
         one system        by another,     till eventually the reproductive cells
         share in the change.

  (2) Apart         from   the    general     connectedness       and    the    common
           medium of the blood, it seems worth while to refer to the
           frequent      occurrence of protoplasmic continuity within the
           system.       In plants the intracellular connections by means of
           protoplasmic      bridges    are widespread     ; this is true in a more
           limited degree of animals.            How open in such cases is the
           organism to an influence from the body to the reproductive
           cells 1 Take such a case, not altogether unique, as the
           embryo       Peripatus, where, according to Sedgwick, an actual
           syncytium of cells obtains for a considerable time, how
            difficult it is there to conceive of the keim plasma keeping
            quite intact, in spite of somatic influences which may play
            upon it.
  ( 3)   Even in the comparatively few cases where a continuity of repro
            ductive cells is demonstrable, it does not seem justifiable to re
            ject the notion that these may be affected by the somatic sheath
             which has grown up around them.              They are surely reachable
             by, the anastates and katastates         of the body, which is simply
             a   more exact way of expressing the penetration of " scent-
             stuff" which Jiiger maintained,           or the limited      liberation of
              gemmules which Galton allowed.               But in     most cases, as we
              have seen, there is not even a continuity                of reproductive
              cells, but only a continuity of a specific reproductive proto
              plasm or nuclear plasma.         How much       more difficult, then, is
              it to conceive of this      as remaining practically untouched by
              the physico-chemical         conditions    of the "soma"?              Even
               Weismann      at times admits that nutritive           vacillations    may
              produce "     ever so  little modifications in the molecular struc
               ture of the keimplasma."          Proof of the     degree of modifica
               tion possible may be as legitimately demanded on the one
               side    as on the    other.    A continuance of many "              ever so
               littles " may amount to much.             Nor   is  it  possible   to draw
               any hard line between modification of the germ-plasma                 along
               with    and through the general      "body."
       (4)  It    is useful, also,   to allude     to   the numerous experiments
               which have      been made on the determination of sex.                 Take
               only one example,       the familiar      case   of    Yung's     tadpoles,
               where,    by altering the quantity and quality of the              food, he

112               Proceedings          of Royal         Society    of Edinburgh.                    [sess.
            was able, for instance, to raise the percentage of females from
            the normal of about fifty to the abnormal of about ninety.
            Here, then, an environmental                    influence, playing in the first
            place      on the nutritive system,                   saturated throughout                 the
            organism, and affected the reproductive system so as to swing
            the balance emphatically to the female side.                              General hyper
            trophy brought out of the primitive indifference an emphatic
            predominance of females.                      In this        case    the reproductive
            system was unquestionably                    reached,    and though the change
            that resulted was not, of course, one that was not in a sense
            implicit in the reproductive cells, it                       was     none the less an
            alteration of the natural bias.                      Some of the forms which
            turned out females               would with           less   nourishment             in their
            natural environment have become males.                              Now the difference
            between a quantitative change such as the above and a quali
            tative change such as the modification of a given structure, is
            only one of degree.                Admit the      one, and there is no logical
            objection          against admitting           the possibility             of any       other
            modification which can be interpreted in terms of anabolic
            or katabolic preponderance.
   My    general conclusion, then,                is,   that while "Weismann's             position in
regard      to the non-inheritance of acquired characters                                suggests      the
advisability          of   a   cautious re-criticism of all apparent cases of the
reverse,     Galton's position of the limited                       inheritance of the same
features     is   at present more             tenable.       Apart from the three argu
ments— (1) from alleged cases, (2) from pathological inheritance,
(3) from the general theory of evolution
                                         — seems to me that the     it
physiological          probabilities        are strongly      in favour of Galton's view.
Nor    is   it   at    all     necessary,    in allowing the limited inheritance of
acquired characters,               to depart from some form of the theory                               of
continuity        on which Weismann                     has so    well insisted.            It    is   not
necessary        to revert to any           literal   pangenesis.          It    is   only necessary
to admit that decisive functional and environmental variations may
send their roots deep into the system, and may affect the reproduc
tive cells along with and even through the others.                                     The sex-cells
will   share     in the altered nutriment and                 waste products, and become
infected to      a    varying degree by the anastates                    and katastates,          which
are the chemical results of the                  individually acquired                characters.

            Hospital.
                                            (Read February      18,    1889.)
                                                    (Abstract.)
      The genus Phreoryctes has been known to zoologists since the year
 1843, but there is no published account of the reproductive system
 sufficiently detailed to permit of comparison                                   with other OligochsDta.
 The gonads (testes and ovaries) and spermatheca; were discovered by
 Leydig,* who did not distinguish between ovaries and testes, owing
to the immature condition of the specimens                                        studied.          This writer
considered             that    the genital products were evacuated through the
 nephridia        of their segment                   The supposition              is,   however,      incorrect,
 as   genital ducts exist.                    Mr W. W. Smith of Ashburton, New                                Zea
 land, forwarded to the author in the spring of 1888                                     a   single specimen
of a new species of Phreoryctes,                       which was described                    in the Annalx
and Magazine                  of Natural History for June                          1888       as    Phreoryctes
Smithii.            In that paper the                 gonads          and their ducts were briefly
described and figured.
      The     present         memoir         is   based upon          a   further supply of material
from Mr Smith, consisting of                           a    large      number of sexually mature
worms.            It   has, therefore,            been found possible to prepare                     a   complete
account of the genitalia of Phreoryctes.
      The following                is   a    brief description of the genus Phreoryctes.
Hoffmeister: —
      1.    The     body      is   extremely elongated,                   sometimes       reaching        to the
length of         a    foot, while the diameter                 is   very small.
      2.    The   prostomium            is    divided into two by            a     transverse        furrow.
      3.    The   setai are        simple, not bifid        ;   they are disposed                  in four rows
 of   single setae, or         of pairs of         setse.
      *4.    There are no genital or penial seUe.f

    *5. The elitellum        occupies      3-4    segments    from the     10th to        the
13th; its epidermis is formed by                  a  single layer of cells,      differing
from the epidermis of the general                   body surface     by   their     greater
length and glandular character.
    6.   The structure of the longitudinal muscles is more complicated
than is usually      the,   case   with aquatic Oligochaeta; the           longitudinal
muscular coat more resembles that of certain Earthworms.
    *7. The nephridia commence in the sexually mature                      worm in        the
 16th segment.
    8.   There are two pairs of testes, which are digitate organs attached
to the anterior septum of segments 10 and 11.
    9.   There are tiro pairs of vasa deferentia opening into the interior
of these segments by a wide funnel-shaped orifice closely attached to
the    posterior septum.          Each vas deferens          opens  independently         on
to the exterior ; the first pair open to one side of the                   ventral    set«e
on the 11th segment,           the second       pair open on to the 12th segment
 in front of the ventral pair of seta;.
     10. There are two pairs of ovaries, occupying                   a   position   corre
 sponding to that of the testes in the 12th and 13th segments.
     11. There are two        j/airs of    oviducts     opening into the interior of
 those     segments   by a wide funnel             closely attached    to the posterior
 mesentery; the external orifices are in the intersegmental grooves
 between      segments    12-13, 13-14, on           a line with the ventral     setaa,
     *12.    In both   vasa deferentia and oviducts the distal                 section    is
 lined with     a chitinous membrane             continuous with that covering          the
 body    ;  they are in other respects closely similar, and the position of
 the external      orifice of the        2nd pair of vasa deferentia is inter
  mediate     between     that of the      1 st pair of vasa deferentia and of          the
 oviducts.
     13.    The developing spermatozoa              are lodged in sperm sacs, which
 extend from the 9th to the 13th segment, and resemble more closely
 the    corresponding       structures       in many aquatic Oligoclucta             (e.g.,
 Tubificidaj) than those of Earthworms.
     *14. The ova, winch are, when fully mature, of large size (one-ba!/
  the diameter of the body), and loaded with yolk granules, undergo
 their development in           egg   sacs   contained in segments         14-16.     The
 ova and egg sacs are more           like    those of the Tubificida} than those of
  Earthworms.

       15.  The    spcrmatheca    are present to the number of from two to
  inree pairs in segments        7, 8   (and 9).
       The above characters        show that Phreoryctes occupies             an inter
  mediate       position between Earthworms            and   the lower Oligochiuta.
  It   should form the type of        a   distinct family.*
       The paper concludes with a discussion of the morphology of the
 yenital ducts and the classification of the Oligocfoeta.

      In    man,   in the rabbit, and      some other animals the trachea is       built
 up of       a series  of cartilaginous rings incomplete behind           ;   the rings
 being completed in this position by the trachealis                muscle.
      The mucous membrane forms a smooth cylindrical lining for                      the
whole tube, and is covered by a ciliated epithelium.
      In    the cat and dog the cartilage rings completely encircle the
trachea, and overlap posteriorly,              aud the trachealis muscle, which is
well developed, is placed outside                the cartilage,  and has    a  powerful
action in varying the diameter of the tube.
      When this muscle contracts the overlapping                ends of the cartilage
 ride one upon another, and the projecting                ends form a vertical ridge
 down the inside of the trachea, which can                be readily seen on slitting
  the organ open.          This ridge is        separated   by  a deep  groove     from
   the other end of the plate.
       The mucous membrane which lines the trachea                    is reflected     in
    lietween the overlapping ends of the cartilage plates, and                therefore
    will  be  subject to friction during their movements.
       That   portion of mucous       membrane      which lines the tip of the pro
   jecting   ridge   will he subject      to the greatest amount of friction,        and
   here  we   find that the ciliated epithelium which lines the general
   wily of the trachea is replaced by stratified squamous epithelium.

  Those portions of the groove             where less friction    occurs   are lined
  by a form of epithelium           transitional   between the ciliated and the
  stratified squamous varieties.
      This led  us to believe that       friction  was the determining agent        in
  forming the squamous epithelium found in these situations.
     In  order to determine whether or not the squamous               epithelium is
 produced from ciliated epithelium present in those situations where
 friction eventually        occurs,    we made sections     of the    trachea   of   a
 foetal kitten, 5 cm. long.
     The cartilage rings were found to surround the trachea                 for only
 three-fourths of its circumference, the trachealis muscle being well
 developed posteriorly, and the mucous membrane                 being thrown into
 folds beneath it.         The mucous membrane          was lined by a stratified
 epithelium, the surface cells of which were columnar, and devoid                   of
 cilia.
     We then cut        sections   from a kitten two weeks         old, and found
that the cartilage now completely encircled the trachea, the ends of
the plates, however, not overriding as yet, though there were indica
tions     of one end projecting inwards             into a fold of the mucous
membrane.          The epithelium lining the mucous membrane               was seen
 to be stratified and ciliated        in all positions.
     It  appears,    therefore, that the stratified       squamous      and transi
tional forms of epithelia present in the adult trachea                  result from
a modification        of ciliated epithelium       of the ordinary type, due to
the influence of       friction  exerted during the animal's life.
    Still  more    remarkable changes have been described            by biologists.
Of Hunters' Gull         there is no histological record.       But in other   case*
there    is abundant testimony to the mutability             of one form of cell
into another     ;  as, for example, the transformation of osteoblasts          into
osteoclasts,   and vice versa.
    In such    cases the cause is unknown,             but is probably environ
mental.
    But in the     case which we have         described there can be no doubt
that the change is brought about by the agency of friction occurring
as a physiological phenomenon during the life              of  the animal.      This
induces the cells in the deeper layers of the epithelium to take on a
new line of development, producing flat keratinised cells in place of
ciliated ones.

 Observations on the Metabolism of Man during Starva
       tion. By D. Noel Paton, M.D., and Ralph Stockman,
       M.D.
                                (Read March 4, 1889.)
    Although the metabolism during starvation           has been investigated
in the most     elaborate   and exhaustive manner in the lower animals
by many different         observers,    as yet few observations have          been
accomplished in man.
    In  1880 Tanner undertook a fast of forty days.             We     have  been
able to procure only a few fragmentary observations upon his                   case
(Brituh Medical Journal, vol. ii.,         1880).    At the  commencement        of
his fast    he weighed 71 "600 kilos., and at the end of twenty-five
days his weight had fallen to 60-000 kilos., indicating a loss of
about 11 "600 kilos., or -162 kilos, per kilo, of his original weight.
    During the first sixteen      days he pretended to take no water, merely
gargling    his mouth with it.          Under   these  conditions     he  became
seriously ill, and lost weight with great rapidity.         After the sixteenth
day he took water ad libitum, and in the course of the next four
days    he gained          lbs.    After this  he again    commenced      to lose
weight.
             On   the 1st day of his fast he passed 29 grms. urea.
                 „     5th            „           „      16       „
                 „   18th             „           „      14       „
Throughout      the period the weather was excessively         warm.      Tanner
rarely walked, but daily drove for some time.              He, however, spent
much of his time receiving people and talking to them.
   A   more    satisfactory series of observations was made             upon an
Italian   named Cetti, who        in 1887 commenced       in Berlin a fast of
thirty  days.     His parents interfered, and his fast was stopped on
the tenth day.
   A large number of       the leading scientific men     in Berlin interested
themselves    in the case, and together undertook          a most    careful and
elaborate series    of observations, which     are recorded    in   the  Berliner
klinische  Wochenschrift for 1887.
   Cetti's age was 26.         He   was lean, and at the beginning of the
fast weighed     57 kilos.;    at the end, 50650 kilos., so that in the

122             Proceedings    of Boyal Society of Edinburgh,                 [sbss.
ten days he lost 6350 grms., or -111 kilos, per kilo, of his               original
weight.       This  loss was by no means       regular, there being somewhat
large     variations.    The   whole    fast might     be divided       into   three
periods: — 1st period of      five days, during which       there was consider
able waste, the loss amounting to 4400 grms., or 880 grms. per diem.
In the 2nd period of two          days   the loss was very slight — only 250
grms., or 125 grms. per diem.           During this period       he    drank more
water than usual.         During the last      three  days   there was a nearly
equal loss of from 500 to 600 grms. per diem            — in all,   1700 grms.
     The urea fell slowly and regularly from 29 grms. per diem to 20
 grms.      The chlorine of the urine fell from 5-5 grms. to 0-6 grms.;
 while sodium and potassium also diminished in amount and changed
 their relative proportions.       The amount of urine passed fell gradu
 ally from the beginning, was always below the normal, and scanty
 in proportion to the fluid      consumed.
     It  was always acid, and became more strongly so towards the end
 of the fast, being then passed thick and turbid, with large quantities
 of   urate  of ammonia crystals.      Phosphoric     acid and calcium were,
 although      absolutely   diminished,     increased    proportionately to the
  other urinary constituents, a result attributed by the observers to               a
  waste of bony tissue.
      Indican    disappeared after the first day, showing          a   cessation   of
  intestinal digestion, while acetone was present in very large amount.
  This is considered by Senator to be an inanition symptom, and its
  occurrence in diabetes and in some cases of cancer is by him sup
  posed to be due to profound          interference with the metabolic pro
  cesses.
      It may be mentioned that Cetti spent most of his time in a some
   what large and cold room.
      The individual upon whom the following observations were made
   is a Frenchman       named    Alexandre    Jacques, who in October 1888
   voluntarily    undertook,    as a public     performance, a fast of thirty
   days.
       Considering the scantiness of our information            in   regard   to the
   metabolism of man during          starvation, we thought       it advisable to
   make what use we could of the case.
       On making inquiries we found that arrangements             had been made

     We have to thank the gentlemen of this committee for much
valuable assistance,            without which our observations could not           have
l*en carried out.              More especially are we indebted to Mr Griffiths
for the endless trouble he took in preparing for us notes of weights,
 of amount          of exercise taken, and of other points of interest
      Jacques is a somewhat slightly built individual, of 47                   years   of
 age.        He is   a Hock-printer, and     was born at St Amant-les-Eaux,       Nord.
 He has no great muscular                development, nor has he any excess of
 subcutaneous fat.              He   has always enjoyed good       health, and states
  that he has           already successfully carried out five different fasts of
  varying duration.
        Four or five years ago he fasted in private for one week. A month
   later he fasted         for fourteen   days.   In   1886 he fasted in London for
    twenty-one          days,   being   watched during       the period.     We     have
    ascertained        that the surveillance was by no means so thorough as
    could be desired.
          In  the spring     of 1887   he fasted in private for   thirty  days, and in
     the    spring of 1888 he underwent in private           a fast of forty days.
          Daring all these fasts he believes that he has been sustained by
     tiking in very small quantities a mixture of certain herbs, which he
     in his first three experiments used in the form of a decoction, but
      in all subsequent       experiments    as a powder.
           The composition of this preparation he keeps a profound secret.
       But before commencing the present             fast, he made a sworn declara
       tion that    it  was entirely composed      of herbs growing in Kent.          Of
       this powder       he took    only the smallest quantities,       a mere    pinch,
        generaUy once,      more rarely twice daily.        On several    days   he did
        not take any.
            Daring the course of his fast he rubbed into his thighs and trunk
        small quantities     of camphorated olive oil.       But in  the course of the
         thirty days, only 306 grms. were so rubbed in.           He   also used small
         'loantities of a lotion which        he applied   to the   head, as he said,
          because  it refreshed him greatly.       On examination this      was found

124            Proceedings     of Eoyal Society of Edinburgh.                 [sess.
to be composed      of water with     a  little alcohol, and     a small quantity
of carbonate     of ammonia.
    On the third day of his fast        he developed the habit         of drinking
his urine in quantities of from       2 to 9 oz.       This  he  did daily, usually
on rising    in  the morning.      The disturbing        influence of this upon
the metabolism is practically        nil,   since   all the urinary constituents
are simply excreted unchanged.            This somewhat disgusting habit is
by no means unknown,            as Jacques himself informed us that it has
long been the custom among             French miners to drink their urine
when deprived of food, owing to mining accidents.                   Certain savage
peoples, such as the Fatagonians, also do so during starvation.
    He was permitted to drink aerated mineral waters ad libitum, a
careful note being always made of the amount consumed.                           He
smoked a good many cigarettes                daily,   and occupied himself        in
reading newspapers,       in playing    cards,   in talking, and in resting on
the    sofa.   He almost daily took           a  walk,    sometimes    during   the
earlier part of his fast two.          The time occupied in this way was
noted.
    During the whole          period    of     the fast his health       was  never
much disturbed.         He  was usually cheerful, though rather irritable.
 During the first few days his tongue            became somewhat coated, and
 his breath very offensive.        On the third and fourth day             he com
 plained of dull epigastric pain, which he said was relieved by taking
 a pinch of his      powder.     His bowels       were    not moved during       the
 whole period of his fast, except on the first day, when a few scyba
 lous masses were passed, but were not kept                 A  few hours after his
 first meal on the completion of his fast, he had a copious formed
 evacuation, which was, however, unfortunately lost.
    During    the whole period, but more           especially towards the latter
 part, he was very sensitive to cold and draughts, and, although                  he
 kept his room at a temperature           usually of 75° F., his temperature
 was invariably     subnormal, ranging from 96° to 93°-4 F.               His pulse
 averaged between       50 and 60.        His respirations      were  usually from
 23 to 30.      His skin felt moist and warm during the whole period.
 His   expression,   naturally somewhat anxious, became rather haggard
 towards the end.
    On the 9th of November he complained of pain and tenderness
 in the ball of the       great  toe, which was         observed   to be red and

inflamed.    His pulse was 84 at 12 noon, the only occasion on which
it rose so high ; but his temperature was only 96°-8-97°-8 F.  Since
a few days after the completion of his fast he had a well-marked
attack of gout, it is fair to conclude that this also was a slight
attack of the same disease.
     One very        important point, upon which               we hoped to gain valuable
information, was the influence of exercise on the metabolism during
starvation. Unfortunately, it was not possible to get results at all
satisfactory.             In
                  the first place, the amount of exercise taken was
exceedingly small ; in the second place, it was not easy to estimate
the precise amount of exercise taken daily.   Inasmuch as during the
hours spent indoors practically no exercise was indulged in, we came
to the conclusion that the most satisfactory results might be arrived
 at by taking, as a measure of the muscular exercise, the duration of
 his daily walks.
      It
      is to he regretted that the conditions of the fast and the pres
 sure of other work rendered it impossible for us to undertake anything
 like the complete series of observations carried out in Cetti's case.
      The following observations only could be accomplished :—
       The weight was daily taken before Jacques had dressed The
     amount of fluid consumed was carefully measured. The urine passed
     was all collected and measured.    Its reaction was taken, and the
     amount of urea             estimated       by the hypobromite        method— Dupre's
     apparatus,          previously tested on standard solutions of urea, being
     used.      A        record of the pulse, temperature,           and general   condition
     was also kept.
           From the        urea the daily waste        of flesh was calculated.      By this
      term    is,   of    course,    meant not merely the muscle substance,          but all
      the various tissues of the body containing nitrogen in the proportion
      in which this          occurs    in   muscle.
           The difference between this and the total              loss of weight gave the
      loss of non-nitrogenous substances.                These non-nitrogenous wasting
      substances          are the fats and carbohydrates         ;    but inasmuch    as the
      latter occur only in small quantities, and are rapidly used up, they
      may be neglected,             and we may consider these non-nitrogenous matters
      as   practically entirely composed of fat.
           Of course, the possibility of variations in the percentage amount of
      water   in the body had to              be considered,   and in all probability this

     played         a certain    part in the variations of loss of weight from                 day        to
     day.           But its influence over longer periods need not be                    considered,

         It will   be observed     that on some occasions        the    loss of flesh, as
«=alculated from the urea, is greater               than the total loss of weight,
    -this    is to be explained      by the fact that Jacques was by no means
    Tegular in the hours at which           he emptied       his bladder, so that the
    weighing of one day is           with  a   full bladder,    on another        with    the
    Tiscus empty.
       Daring the thirty days he lost 10-316                grms. or '166 kilos, per
    kilo,  of his original weight ; in all about           J of   his original weight
    On  an average he lost -34 kilos, per diem.
      During the first five days of the fast the urea excretion was high
  and     irregular — a fact which has been so frequently                     observed      in
 starving animals,           but which was not manifested          in Cetti's    case.
     Dividing the fast up into six periods of five days, we see the
gradual fall in the daily excretion of urea till the very low figure of
"'3 grms. per diem is reached.

     On account of his irregular habits in              regard     to the emptying of
his bladder, whereby the night urine is sometimes                      counted witli the
past day, sometimes              with the    succeeding     day,    the    urea excretion
manifests on one or two occasions somewhat large variations.
     Table      II.  gives a general    summary of the results worked out for
six periods of five days each.
     The results for Period I.           are not given, because our observations
during this period were incomplete.
      It will     be observed       that in Periods     II., III., IV., V.,         and   VI.
 there is a slow and             steady fall in the flesh      waste.       On the other
 hand, the loss of non-nitrogenous matter is by no means                             so con
  stant, its relationship          to the flash waste being       in Periods      III., IV.,
  and     VI.    as about *6 to       1, while     in Periods    II.   and     V   the   pro
  portion is very much raised.              That this is not due to         a  retention of
   water    during the former three           periods is indicated by column             8   of
   the table.       Period     III.  may, perhaps,    be accounted        for by this, but
   in the   other periods the proportion between the fluid taken and the
  flaid    excreted        by   the urine   remains    constant.        Of   course,    it is

   possible that a diminished            loss    of   water from the       skin and air pas
   sages may have occurred             during these periods.              On this subject we
   have no evidence.        "We do not consider that the variations                        in the
   exercise taken during         these     different periods will account for these
   variations in the non-nitrogenous waste, although                    it is highly probable
   that the large non-nitrogenous waste                 during the second period was
   associated    with the   large amount of exercise              taken.       "We are   entirely
   at a loss to explain the rise                in the non-nitrogenous           waste    during

       But we    may analyse      still further       these results.
       During the twenty-eight              days on which              Jacques     was     under
  observation, he passed 316               grms. of urea,         corresponding to about
  1   47 grms. of nitrogen.        This    represented       a   waste of flesh amounting
  to 4330 grms.,      which would contain 500 grms. of carbon.                           Of this,
  63 grms. were excreted          as urea.        The remaining 437 must have been
   passed out as carbonic acid.

   Bat in addition             to    this, 4046 grms. of non-proteid matter were
used up.         Xow this,      as already indicated, we may practically regard
as fat,      since    the cabohydrates                need     not be considered.               Xow fat
contains       30 per      cent, of water, and hence this amount would repre
sent 2832        grms. of solid          fat, and in this would                   be contained about
2174 grms.           of carbon.
  Thus we         see that     in all 2230            grms.    of carbon          were lost from the
body     in twenty-eight             days ; that         is,   during the fast there was an
average daily excretion of 77 grms. of carbon. Xow in man on
                                                 "6                                         a
ordinary diet and work about 280 grms. of carbon are daily
excreted, so that           the carbon excretion fell to about                      \   of its normal
amount.
  On the other hand,                 147 grms. nitrogen                 being excreted          in   these
twenty-eight          days, we have          a   daily excretion of 5-2 grms. instead of
the normal           15 or 16 grms., so that the nitrogenous excretion also
fell to about        \    of its normal amount.
      In this    case, then, apparently the proportion                           of the proteid to     the
 non-proteid         waste was undisturbed during starvation.
      Is it    possible, from these observations,                       to come       to any general
 conclusions         in   regard to the probable composition of the body at the
 end of the fasting period as compared with the beginning                                   t       Taking

   The oil rubbed in amounted to only 306 grins., an amount which
need not be considered.                 Hence we see that even at the end of a
fast of    thirty   days,    there still was a very considerable quantity            of
fat in the body.
    Hofmann        (Ztscli.  f.   Biolgie,   Bd. viii. p. 153) found that dogs
had to be starved for a period of about thirty days before all the
fat had disappeared          from the body, and that the final disappearance
of fat was indicated by a sudden rise in the excretion of nitrogen,
after which the dogs, unless fed, rapidly died.                  This did not occur
in Jacques'      case, and we should consider the appearance               of such a
rise in the urea       excretion as the important indication for instantly
stopping any voluntary fast.
   From the accompanying table it will                be seen that the metabolism
in the present case was much slower than in either Tanner's or Cetti's.
Nor was there any evidence of the same profound disturbance in the
metabolism which was indicated in Cetti's case by the appearance
of acetone in large quantities in the urine.                 At one period Jacques'
urine was observed to have a peculiar smell, suggestive of liquorice,
but not in the least resembling acetone.                    Some of this urine was
distilled, but the distillate was free of any unusual smell.
   Altogether       the metabolism here is much more like that observed
by Voit in old fat dogs, while Cetti's case rather resembles                  the pro
cesses as    8 ecu  in young     lean animals.

         After       some years        of patient observation and                  research,    I    have
  found, from direct               experiment,    that    at   certain times the contractile
   or pulsating vacuole of the Protozoa performs the function of                                    a true
   kidney,          or,   in other words, its     secretion     is capable of yielding micro
   scopic crystals of uric acid.
         Three        organisms       were    used   in    these        experiments,     namely : —
   Amoeba, Yorticella,              and Paramcecium.

         We will consider, in the first              place, the small Protozoon                  which
    Haeckel called Amceba spharocoeeus.                         By observing           a number         of
    these organisms under the high                   powers of the microscope,                 there    is
      seen,    within      the structure of each, a small cavity or vacuole filled at
       certain times        with   a transparent fluid.          There is little doubt that
       the   fluid which gathers in the vacuole is drawn from the surround
       ing protoplasmic        substance, and is returned to                 it,   or forced out to
       the   exterior on the contraction          of the walls of the vacuole.

                                    (Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond., vol.           xliv.     p. 325),
that the five pouches         of the stomach of the Asteridea                also perform
the function       of kidneys (i.e., the          digestive apparatus           performs       a
dual function).        And whatever may be the multitudinous functions
of the Protozoan contractile vacuoles, one thing is certain, that they
secrete periodically a waste nitrogenous substance.                   This nitrogenous
substance    was proved to be uric acid.
    A number of         amoebae      were    placed     on  a  microscopic       slide     and
covered by a thin glass slip.             Alcohol was run in between               the slide
and cover-slip, so      as  to  kill the      organisms.       It was    found that in
many cases moderately weak                alcohol caused no contraction of the
vacuole.     The alcohol was followed by nitric acid                ;  the   slide gently
warmed,     and,    finally, ammonia          introduced between the slide and
cover-slip.     In    a  few minutes,          prismatic     crystals    of   murexide*
having    a beautiful       reddish-purple colour, made their appearance.
After the addition of alcohol                (as already      stated),   minute        flaie-s
could be distinctly seen floating in the fluid of certain contractile
vacuoles.      Bearing in mind the murexide reaction, there is every
reason to believe that these             flakes    are nothing more         or less than
minute crystals of uric acid.
    These   reactions     have     been constantly         repeated    during     the    past
few years, and always         with     the same results.
    It appears, from close microscopic observations, there are times
when     the     fluid   of    the contractile         vacuoles    does     not     contain
the least    trace    of uric acid.         Most likely the Protozoan vacuoles
perform more than one function.                  It  is possible that they represent
" an internal respiratory apparatus " as well as an excretory organ
or " kidney."        There is little doubt that we have in the contractile
vacuole of the amoeba             a  primitive      kidney or renal system.              The
protoplasmic matter of this naked little cell (as well as the waste
albuminous substances of its food) frequently undergoes chemica!
 " disintegration."

tains   is  drawn from the surrounding           protoplasmic matter, and is
ultimately forced by the contraction of               its walls    towards     the
periphery of the bell, and finally ejected into the water in which the
organism lives its life-history.        The contractile vacuole of Vorticella
performs     the   function    of   a true    kidney.    Its   secretion    yields
microscopic crystals of murexide and uric acid when submitted to
the  same chemico-microscopical reactions as those already described.
                               III.  Paramecium.
   Parametrium bursaria          belongs,  like Vorticella,   to the   Infusoria.
We have in this organism the beginning of a true alimentary canal,
— with its mouth and slender oesophagus. The contractile vacuoles
of Faramoecium       are situated   in the   ectosarc  almost at each end of
the long axis of     the " body."      These cavities are filled with a trans
parent fluid.     During the systole fine radiating        canals are produced
which probably communicate with the exterior.
   The contractile vacuoles of Paramcecium bursaria                  are physio
logically the "kidneys."          By the    same reactions as those       already
described    (in connection with the Amoeba), the secretion of these
vacuoles yields crystals of murexide and uric acid. There is little
doubt that    these vacuoles get      rid of the  waste nitrogenous products
during the    systoles which take place periodically.
   In  these three    primitive    forms of the animal kingdom, we have
the rudiments of a true renal system.           The contractile vacuoles per
form the    same function as the kidney         of higher forms, by yielding
the same nitrogenous substance          which is found in the renal organs
of the highest      vertebrates.     By the    agency   of living protoplasm
(that all-important life substance), even these insignificant micro
scopic cells bring about chemical metamorphoses                  in albuminoid
molecules, with the production            of uric acid and possibly          other
substances.      Therefore, in these primitive cells, there lies the same
power of chemical metamorphosis as we find in the more complex
cells of the highest vertebrate.
   Through all the multitudinous changes which have taken place
during the lapse of ages, in the development of the mammalian
kidney,    we find that the physiological functions are the same as
occur in its original or primitive form (represented          by the Protozoa).
Surely   it is not going    too far to say that    within    these lower forms

organisms to breathe,         digest, and excrete.      The only difference      is
that in    the Protozoa the cell performs numerous functions, whereas
in   the Yertebrata these functions are localised in special organs.
    Having     in my     studies on the physiology        of the Invertebrata
proved the renal functions of many doubtful               organs,   it would    be
interesting     at this point to give,      by means of a table, the physio
logical development of the renal         system    from the Protozoa to Mol-
lusca.
    It  will be  seen from the above table that the primitive          "

organ.      In the next    progressive    stage of its development,       we find
the kidney, a cellular tubule       secreting only waste nitrogenous matters
and assuming      a definite function.       And, finally, in the higher    stages
of the Invertebrata the kidney         becomes    a sacculated    and   glandular
organ resembling more in detail the vertebrate           kidney.

   In   a previous     communication        I described the apparatus first
used for      counting   the    dust   particles in the atmosphere.         That
apparatus     was   constructed of such        materials   as could be easily
obtained ready made, and was fitted together in such a way that
any one acquainted with laboratory work could easily repeat the

 experiments.         Though      that    apparatus is satisfactory            enough     for
 preliminary work, and gives fairly good results, yet                      it is evidently
 not suited for regular everyday use               ;  and, besides       that, there axe
 certain defects       in it which       can be avoided       in apparatus specially
 constructed. If a regular examination of the dust in the air was to
 be made from day to day, it seemed advisable that I should devote
 some time to         devising      a more     practical    form    of apparatus,         one
 which could be more easily and quickly worked, and which could
 be managed         by any one not having a special knowledge of the
  subject
     With this object in view              I  have, during     this summer,         devoted
  a considerable        time to the construction           and testing of the new
  apparatus    ;  and the object of this paper is to describe                 the improve

  drawings of the different parts of the apparatus,                 so that any       instru
  ment-maker may be able to reproduce                it    I may    as well give notice
  here   that the general reader is warned off, as what follows is a
  dreary desert of mechanical details, which however necessary                             for
  those    who are going to assist in developing the investigation, yet
  contains nothing new of scientific interest                  Anything new in that
  direction    will  be found near the end of the paper.
      The alterations and improvements will be best understood by the

different parts.
                                                Test-Receiver.
  In the apparatus                   described       in the previous communication, the
test-receiver was made of an                        ordinary flat-bottomed flask. When
working with this apparatus                         it   was noticed that the raindrops did
not always            fall vertically          on the counting stage, but from time to
time they were seen to fall obliquely.                               Through       the magnifying
glass,   it looked             as    if   a    miniature        storm was       raging inside the
receiver,      and driving the raindrops before it.                          When this       happened
the reading            had     to be rejected,             as    no reliance could           bo placed
on the number                obtained under these                 conditions.      To    investigate
 the cause           of   these     irregular currents, the interior of the receiver
 was illuminated             by     a   strong light concentrated in               it by     means of
 the water lens, and the movements                         of the air at the different points,
 when expansion                was      made, was examined               by means of a lens, the
 condensed particles indicating the direction of the currents.
    Examination              showed that when expansion was made,                            a   vertical
 circulation          of the air in the flask took place — the air next                               the
 sides   of the flask forming the ascending current, while the descend
  ing one occupied the centre.                      The cause of these currents is evident.
  When expansion is made the air is cooled, but the air in contact
  with the sides of the flask rapidly absorbs                            heat from the glass, and
  an upward           rush of air takes place all round the sides.                      If    the flask
  has the same            temperature all round, then these ascending currents
  meet near          the top, curve over, and descend in the centre of the flask,
  leaving the part over the stage almost unaffected ;                              but if one side
  of the flask        is hotter than the other, then the current from that side
  is stronger         than the current opposed                   to it at the top, and             over
  powers       it,   driving   the air across the stage             in   a   horizontal direction.
     The       cause of the disturbance having been found out,                                attempts
   were made         to remedy          it,   by placing screens round the stage to pre
  vent the      currents passing across it.                     The result of this arrangement
   was   however unsatisfactory, because these screens, though they were
  fes than       a    centimetre in height, gave rise to currents, by heating
   the air   in contact with them               ;   so that, while they checked              the larger
   currents,    they caused small ones, which, owing to their nearness to the

138          Proceedings        of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                   [i
stage, interfered with the correctness         of the results. After this another
plan was tried, and     it   has been found to work satisfactorily.            It con
sists  in reducing the height of the receiver           as much as possible, and
increasing the horizontal dimensions to such an extent that the verti
cal currents do not move across the receiver and disturb the air over
the counting stage    ;   in addition     to this, the stage is placed on a floor
in the receiver,   because        when supported at a height, as in the first
receiver, currents are formed            on the support and rise round it,
 disturbing   the air, and interfering         with the equal distribution            of
 the drops.    The new arrangement gives most satisfactory                    results.
 When expansion is made, the condensed                 particles are seen falling
 vertically,  and the distribution of the particles is even all over the
 stage, which would not be the case unless there was an entire absence
 of currents while the drops were falling.
     The manner in which this plan             has been practically carried out
 will  be best  understood by a reference            to Plate   II., where fig.     1 is
 a vertical section of the receiver ; fig. 2 is another vertical section at
 right angles to fig.    1 ;   fig. 3 is a horizontal    section,  while   fig. 4 is   a
 plan of the top of the receiver.         A  is a glass cylinder, such as is used
 for pneumatic experiments, with its            ends melted and ground.             B is
 a circular disc of plate glass, ground and polished, which closes the
 upper end of the cylinder          A.    The bottom of the cylinder is closed
 by the metal disc C, through which                pass the different tubes pre
 sently to be referred to.            The bottom may be cemented                to the
 cylinder, or a ground joint may be employed.                The counting stage       E
 is supported inside the receiver by means                  of the     tube   D — the
 upper surface of the stage being at a distance of exactly               1  cm. from
 the glass top B.     The tube D is supported inside the receiver, and
  kept vertically in its place by means of the tube            F, which is part of
  the metal bottom C, or fixed firmly to it.          The tube D has a shoulder -
  piece  G worked   on   it in such     a position that when       D is in its   place,
  and the shoulder   G pushed up into contact with the lower end of F,
  the counting stage is in its correct position, namely, 1 cm. below

 of such a size that the tube D slides easily inside it, and its lower
 end is slightly widened, as shown.             The disc      I is attached to a wire
 L,  which    passes through the bottom of the receiver,              and is used for
 moving the diaphragm          I up   and down.         In   order to avoid the use
 of  a stuffing box,     with its inconvenient tightness, the wire          L  projects
to   some   distance outside the bottom of the receiver, and is there
surrounded       by an indiarubber         tube M, slightly larger in internal
diameter than the wire.            The tube     M is closed at the bottom, and
firmly   attached      to the receiver     by the pipe N.           O is the pipe by
which the air        enters  the receiver.       It  is provided at the lower end
with a    stopcock,     while the top is closed, and two side openings close
to the top are provided for the escape of the air. Over the top of
this pipe is fixed the deflector P. The pipe 0 should be small,
say    2 mm.,     or the expansion of the air            in it will give     rise  to a
slight disturbance of the air in the receiver when condensation is
taking    place.      Q is the outlet pipe, and its lower end is connected
by means of an indiarubber tube with the air-pump. At the upper
end of Q is a cap R screwed into the end of the pipe. This cap has
a large cover, which prevents the disc                    I  from rising above its
proper position.         At  the lower end of Q is a tuft of closely-packed
cotton wool, kept in its place by means of a ring.                   The air enters Q
through a small hole near the top of the tube; just under the screw
of the cap S is a magnifying glass for viewing the stage.                            To
the under side of its ring is attached a piece of indiarubber                     cord,
which prevents the           glass   getting    scratched and the          lens from
slipping.      T  is   a pipe   provided      with     a stopcock      for  supplying
the receiver with water.             It  is connected       by means of an india-
rubber     tube   with   a vessel   of  water.      U  is a bent tube, one leg of
which    passes up the tube        D, and terminates just under the              closed
end of D.        Both     ends  of tube     U  are open.       It  is soldered to the
short tube     V, which fits tightly inside D ; it is thus kept firmly in
its position, but can be removed when required.
    The two     sides   of the diaphragm      I are   covered    with blotting-paper
fastened on with indiarubber            solution.      The under side of the top
plate B is also covered in the same way, but an opening is cut in
this piece for viewing         the counting stage and for admitting               light
(see  XX.   fig. 4).

    After the receiver is      completed,     with its pipes, &c, it is graduated.
This   is done by     filling it with water, which is easily accomplished
by inverting it and pouring in water through O, while the air is
allowed to escape by T. The receiver is then put in its correct posi
tion and levelled;          after which      350 c.c. of water is run out, and
three marks are made           at equal distances round the cylinder at the
water-level.       In  using the receiver afterwards the water is kept at
this leveL
    The receiver is supported at a height of 13 inches above the
table.     For this purpose three             sockets,  W, W, W,         figs.   1  and 4,
may be cast on the bottom plate C, into which                    three legs may be
fixed   ; or the tripod stand shown in section and plan in fig. 5 may
be used.      In the tripod sketched, in addition to the three sockets for
the legs, there is a fourth          for carrying a rod to support the lens
 used for condensing the          light on the       stage.    This    eaves a special
stand for the lens.         The tripod is drawn to a scale of            \ size.
     On Plate   III.   fig. 7, is given a full size sketch of the counting
stage,    and the top end of the tube D.                   This   stage     is made of
silver and highly polished.            It  is ruled with lines at right angles
to each    other, and at exactly         1   mm.   apart.     These lines should be
extremely fine.         To the under side of the        stage is fixed a rod which
is used for holding           it when polishing.          This rod also fits into
the socket in the top of the tube D and keeps the stage in its
 place.
     As the silver counting stage requires to be kept well polished,                      it
 is necessary    to remove      it frequently from the receiver.                In actual
 practice   I generally take it out after the day's work.                      To enable
 this to be done easily, there are two plans, either of which may be
 adopted.      The plate B, forming            the top of the receiver, may be
 fitted on with grease.         As the two      surfaces are ground,        it  makes an
 easily opened air-tight joint.          If this  plan is adopted, then the tube
 D may     be  firmly fixed to the bottom of the            receiver   ;   but it should
 be retained, as     it   has other duties besides         that of supporting           the
 stage.    The other plan is the one shown in the drawings.                        The top
 of the receiver is cemented on, and the stage is withdrawn from the
 receiver by taking          out the tube D to which             it  is    attached,    the
 indiarubber      tube    H making the joint         between    the tubes D and            F
 air-tight     The principal objection to the first plan is that it is very

dirty, the      grease sticking to everything         with which it       comes in con
tact, so that      I prefer  to use the second.
    The plate B        is fastened on      with the ordinary strong solution of
indiarubber,       which makes an air-tight joint, and is sufficiently strong
for the      purpose,    while at the same time the joint can be forced
when     necessary       to get    access   to the interior          for cleaning, &c.
Should this joint leak at any            time, all that is necessary is to make
a stroke of the pump, and rub the place where the fault is with                          a
little of the indiarubber            solution, which soon closes it.             At first
some difficulty was found in making                  quite tight the joint where
the tube D enters the receiver.              The   leakage was due          to imperfec
tions on the interior        surface of the indiarubber tube, and the               joint
had always to be tied.            This difficulty    has, however,       been overcome
by improving the inside of the indiarubber                   tube.      To do this     the
tube is drawn over a piece of brass tube slightly larger than itself,
half an inch        or so of  it is turned back so as to expose             the interior.
 This   surface is then carefully rubbed over where defective, with the
solution of indiarubber, till         good contact      is made    ;  a quantity of the
 solution is put on sufficient to fill up all imperfections                ;  the surface
 of the     brass   tube is then wetted with water, and the indiarubber
 tube turned to its natural position, and left a day or two to dry.
 By this      means all inequalities      in the interior of    the tube are levelled
 up, and      it is always found to make a perfectly tight              joint when put
 in its  place without       being tied.      For   convenience,       the indiarubber
 tube   H    is cemented to the shoulder piece G on the tube D.
    If this     indiarubber     joint is objected      to, then a metal one held
 close by means of a screw may be used.                   The joint would require
 to be made quite true and air-tight                 If   a leather washer is used,
 care must be taken, as any variation in its thickness will alter the
 distance       between the stage and the top of the receiver.                        The
 arrangement sketched has              been    found to work satisfactorily and
 easily.       When the stage is to be taken out, the tube D is simply
  drawn down with a slight twisting movement, and it comes away
  easily  ;  in putting it in its       place,   the process is simply reversed,
  twisting till     one feels the shoulder is resting against               F.   But for
  general use, perhaps the screw joint is the best.
     Before taking the stage out, the stopcock               T is opened and all the
  water is allowed to run out of the               receiver.     In withdrawing the

stage         it    sometimes           gets     wet in its passage                throe
caused by air rushing in between                              D and F, and              blo_\
over it.               This wetting can be easily avoided by ket
cock on            0    open, and drawing the stage out                       slowly ; C^==

staga              The pressure            inside drives the water down                       at

of   K.        The diaphragm               I     forms   a   floor at the level of the com
stage, and             is   kept up to its correct               level by the indiarubber                 tub

     In       the       measuring          apparatus         described        in    the      previous         papt
there         are defects which                 evidently make          it    unsuitable for everyday
work.          In devising                the new apparatus,             besides     making         it    a    more
permanent form, one point specially kept in view was to make the
arrangements                 such    that the time required                       for measuring should
be short, in order that the air might lose                                   as   few of its particles           as
possible while               it     was being measured.                  Two different plans                   have
been      tried, and both found to work well.                                      Each of thesis plans
possesses certain advantages                       over the other, and             it   is   for the operator
to determine which                      will    best suit the conditions                  under     wlich       his
tests are to be made.                      The two plans are shown in Plate                        III.       Figs.

           Turning    now to the first plan,                   fig.    1    is an elevation of the
 ap/iaratas, fig. 2 a plan in section, fig. 3 an end elevation.                                        These
•are ail      drawn to a       scale of        half    size.    Fig.       4 is a   full   size section of
»n important            part of           the apparatus.              The letters in the different
figures all correspond. AA is a pipe through which the air to be
tested is caused to circulate, B is the measuring cylinder, CC is a
pipe connected at its lower end with the chamber D and a filter E.
"When   in use CC is connected at its upper end with the test-receiver
by    means of a short length of indiarubber tube (gee Plate I.). F
is a stopcock situated, as shown, between A, B, and C. The plug of
this stopcock has the passage through it bored at right angles as
 shown, and not straight through, as is usually the case.         The
 working of this arrangement will be most easily understood from an
  pram i nation of the full size drawing, fig. 4. It will be seen that
  when the plug is in the position drawn, the air-pump B is in
  connection with the pipe carrying the air to be tested, and if the
     piston    be drawn out the cylinder will                         get filled     with this    air.       If
     the   stopcock be now turned                     one quarter round, the pump                 will       be
     put    into connection through the stopcock with the pipe C                                  ;    and if
      piston be now pushed down, the air in the cylinder will
     the                                                                                              be sent
  by the pipe C into the chamber D, its passage upwards being                                     chocked
     by the stopcock on the receiver.   From D the measured quantity of
     dusty air is drawn up through    C and carried into the receiver, its
     place being supplied by filtered air from E.
           The cylinder B        has a capacity of 10                 c.c, and by          means of     it   we
       can measure      any quantity of air from                 ^     c.c. to 10 cc.         When more
       than 10 cc. of dusty air requires to be sent into the receiver at one
       time, then the plug of the stopcock is turned one quarter farther
       round.        By this   means the pipe C communicating                          with the   receiver
       is put into direct connection with                      the pipe        A, and       the air to be
       tested can be drawn direct from                    A    into the receiver.            The method
       of measuring when the plug is in this position, and when quantities
       larger than 10 cc. are required,                  will   be explained further on.
            The points to be aimed at in the construction of the part of the
       apparatus      shown at fig. 4 are — first, to have the plug of the stopcock
       as small as     possible with the requisite tightness.                         As    there is never
                                                       amount of "cover"                    not necessary.

  plug is in order that the passage through it may be short, so that
  as little dust      as possible      may be lost by settling in the narrow pas
 sage.      The second point to be attended                   to is to have the passages
 in the body of         the stopcock       joining A,     B, and C as short as possible.
  The passage joining           I  is of no importance.             The object of having
 these passages short is to ensure that the air in them shall be in the
 same condition as the air in the spaces into which they open.
     In order that        the stopcock         F  may be worked with ease and pre
 cision, three stops are provided for checking the movement of the
 handle when the ports are in the correct position.                        These stops are
 shown by the dotted lines at H,, H.„ H3, fig.                      4.   The first and last
 of these stops are fixed            ;   the middle one is arranged          so that   it  can
 be removed.           When working with             the cylinder measure, the handle
 G moves between the stops                  Hj   and II„.      When at H, the cylinder
 is in connection with           A,     and the air to bo measured           and tested is
 then taken in.           When      the handle is pushed up against the stop H.„
 the    passage between         the cylinder          and   the pipe C is opened,         and
 the measured quantity of dusty air can                      be  driven into D.       When
 we wish to allow the air to pass direct from A to the receiver,                          the
 stop   II„  is removed and the handle brought up against H3, when the
 passage between          A through I         to C is opened.
     Turning now to the method of measuring by means of the cylinder.
 It will   be seen that it is provided with a piston which is fitted with
 two cupped          leathers.      Two leathers         have   been used, because        the
 piston must        be   quite tight, and         as pressures     act both ways,     it  was
 thought best to use         a cup      looking each way.          The tube   L is securely
 fixed to the end of            the cylinder          by means of        a movable     screw
joint, in the manner shown.                   This   tube is slightly larger in diameter
than the cylinder, and acts as a guide to the piston rod; it also
carries the scale and the stops used in measuring.                        To the piston is
fixed the piston rod K, which is moved                      by means of the collar M,
which slides on L.             The piston and collar are connected by means
of   a  pin   N   passing through them.                The pin N slides in the slots
00     cut in the pipe       L.      The collar M is grasped by the finger and
thumb, and when moved back and forward carries the piston with
it.    In   the pipe      L,  at right angles         to the slots     00,  are a series of
holes     P   . .  .   P drilled       at   certain    equal   distances   apart.   In    the

cm.      intervals,           the    first being at                  1    cm.        from lowest position                      of
the piston.                In      the    instrument             I       have        constructed the cylinder
has an             area      slightly         less      than     1       square        cm.          In graduating              it,
the      length of cylinder required to hold 10 c.c. of water was care
fully        ascertained.            This length               was then marked on                     L,    and divided
into        10, and the holes bored.                           By this arrangement,                   when the collar
is moved up                one hole,           1     c.c. of air         is    taken into the cylinder                    ;    if
moved up two holes,   cc. are taken in, and so on. To enable

number of tests to be made quickly with exactly the same quan
tity     of dusty air, a pin,                      Q,   is   put into one of the holes,                          P,   at the
desired capacity. This pin stops the outward movement of the
collar at the correct position, and enables the successive measure
ments to be made accurately as well                                      as    quickly.
      The whole measuring apparatus                               is     supported by the wooden stand
 Y,     to which          it   is   fixed by screws                  through the flange                    X;    and    Y      is
 securely clamped to the table under the test-receiver.
       In working with                   this apparatus,                 one or two trials are first made
 to find out the amount of dusty air that will be most suitable for
 testing.            Suppose we find                 1   cc     gives too few drops and                      5   c.c. gives
 too many, we may select to work with, say,                                                2    cc.       The pin         Q    is
 accordingly put into the second hole, and testing begun.                                                    The handle
 of the stopcock               F    is   put up against the stop                           Hj   ;   the piston       is   then
 drawn out            till    stopped          by the pin            Q    at   2     c.c   ;    the stopcock turned
 till   it    is   stopped by          Hj, the piston pushed down, and the c.c of                                 2
 air sent into C.                   From this     will be seen that very little time
                                                         it                                                                    is
 required to measure the air                            ;    practically only the time required to
  pull out and push back the piston, and for                                            each succeeding               test, of
  which perhaps ten may be made to get                                          a    good average, exactly the
  same amount of air                     is   measured          and sent into D.                      After      the air       is
  in
        D
        it         loses but        little of its dust,                  as   it     has not time to fall down
  through the long vertical column of dustless air underneath                                                    it    before
  it   is   carried into the receiver.
        By working in the manner                             above described,                   we can by means of
  the    cylinder and piston measure accurately any quantity of air from
   10   cc     down to          1   cc,       and even to            £        c.c,   if    a   hole   is   drilled in the
  right place.               But    if     we wish to measure                           smaller quantities, then
  we    mast        use the part                of       the    apparatus shown at                         B,   which          is

simply        an    arrangement            for moving the piston accurately to short
distances by means of a screw.                           The male screw is fixed to the end
of the       tube L, while the nut                 closes the end of the tube, as shown.
This        screw should have a very wide pitch.                            One turn of the screw
should advance the piston at least                         2 mm.      — that      is,   according to size
of cylinder, should push the piston forwards sufficient to displace
\    c.c.     The object of the wide pitch                     is    to enable the movement to
be made         quickly.              The nut      is    provided with           a      projection which
comes against            a   stop on the male screw                      at the point furthest                in,
as   shown in fig.        5.      The circumference of the nut has                      a    scale engraved
on it.        The rod     S      fits easily inside the tube               L,    and presses against
the closed end of the nut.                     This rod should              be of such         a   length as
to prevent           the piston            being    drawn          out     more      than     \    or    1   cm.
The reason for using the rod                       S,   and not allowing the piston rod to
be drawn out to the end of its stroke, and there                                   come        into contact
with the screw,            is,   that the great amount of air in the long length
of the cylinder might be so much influenced by change of tempera
ture as to make           it     impossible accurately to measure very small quan
tities.       When using this part of the                          apparatus      the rod      S   is   put in
its place, and this reduces the stroke of the pump to less than                                          1   cm.
Before drawing out the pump, the screw                                R    is   turned back from its
stop    till the index points                at the quantity we wish to measnre, say
     on the scale.             The piston               then drawn out             till stopped by the
                                                is is
1,
rod    S,    and after the stopcock                     turned the screw          R     is   turned till its
movement           is   arrested by its stop.                By    these    movements           the desired
quantity       is   rapidly and accurately                measured,        and little time          is   given
for the dust         to settle in the apparatus.                     After the quantity of air is
measured        in this way, the stopcock                  F       should be turned before the
receiver stopcock                is   opened   ;   and before making the next test the
cylinder      B     should be emptied and                a    fresh charge taken in.
     The tightness of the piston in the measuring cylinder should be
tested from time to time, because                        it   is   evident that any leakage                  will
give rise to errors               in the number of dust particles counted.                                   The
manner of testing                is   as   follows — The stopcock
                                                    :                            F      is   put up against
the stop       Hj, and the air in             the receiver          is   thoroughly purified.                The
stopcock       is   now turned against the stop                            and two or three strokes
of the measuring piston made.                           By    these      movements filtered air                is
taken out of         C,   and again returned.                 If the      piston     is   not quite tight,

some      dust   will have got into the air in C, which will show when
this air is sent into the receiver and expanded.
     Having explained             the action of the                    apparatus       when measuring
quantities from a fraction of a cubic centimetre to 10 cubic centi
metres,        I shall
                    now explain its action when larger quantities have
to be     measured.   In this case the pump connected with the receiver
is used as          the measure.             When dealing with large quantities of
dusty air, the first         thing to        be done         is,   as before,       to purify the air in
the receiver.            To do this the stopcock U                             opened, and              has its
                                                                           is is
                                                                                                F
handle         against  the stop Hr After the air                                  purified the stopcock
U    is   closed,    and ~F brought up against H3.                             The receiver stopcock
is   closed, a      stroke of the pump                made, the piston pushed back, and
the stopcock         W     closed.         On now opening the receiver stopcock, air
from      A     rushes in, and from                 the diameter           of the air-pump and the
length of stroke we have made, we can calculate                                    the number of cubic
centimetres         of air that have          entered the receiver.                  "We shall, however,
refer more        particularly to this method of working later                               on.
     We now come to the                    second         plan     of measuring the dusty air.
This      is   shown     in Plate     III.   fig.    6.     As will be seen,          it   consists simply
in the use of a four-way stopcock as                               a     measure,     and the quantity
measured          depends on the capacity of the hole in the plug. The
stopcock         shown in the figure the smallest of the set belonging to
                                                 is
my apparatus.              As   it   was to be used for small quantities, two mea
sures ofdifferent capacities were put into the one plug, but the larger
measures have only one. The air to be tested       drawn through AA.           is
 The port        B   is connected with              the     test- receiver,         while the port        C   is
 attached        to the filter D.          In using this apparatus                    one of the ports
A    is   connected        by means of           a    pipe with the source of the air we
 wish to test       ;    the other    is   attached         to an aspirator.            When the plug
is   turned so that the bore               is   horizontal,         as    shown in left-hand figure,
 the aspirator           draws the air to be tested through the stopcock,                                  and
 the bore        gets full of the air we wish to test                              While this      is   taking
 place,        one stroke       of the       receiver        air-pump          is    made.      When       the
 measuring          stopcock     is   now turned with the bore vertical, as in
 right-hand figure, the air rushing up from the filter carries the plug-
 ful of dusty air along with                     it       into     the receiver.            Knowing        the
 capacity        of the plug,        we know          the amount of dusty air that has
 entered the receiver.               In   the measuring stopcock sketched, the larger

148             Proceedings        of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                        [sbs.
bore has a capacity         of    \ c.c,  the    other    ^    c.c.   The others of the
set have capacities        of   1 c.c. and 5 c.c.
    There is    a pipe,   not shown in sketch, connecting                 A  to A, outside
the stopcock.         This     pipe  is of smaller bore than A, and its object
is to allow a constant          current of air to       bo   kept flowing through the
 pipe while the measuring           stopcock is closed in that direction.                  Thi3
 pipe is most easily connected            a little on each side of AA.
     As to the relative         advantages     of the two methods of measuring
 the air, the cylinder plan          has the advantage           that the one apparatus
 measures all quantities without any change in the arrangements                          ;  and
 further, it does not confine            us to certain fixed         quantities.       It   also
 enables us to check          our results, by using twice or any suitable mul
 tiple of the dusty air, and for experimental purposes                     it  seems to be
 the best.      On the other hand, the stopcock                   plan seems to be the
 most accurate, as, practically, no time               is given for the dust to settle
 in the measure.          If   the air to be        tested is very       impure, so that
 the quantities to be measured               are very small,         such  as        c.c. and
 under, and if the impurity of the air does not vary much, then the
 stopcock      measure    is the best.        It  is also much more easily worked
 than the other, fewer movements                being required        for each test.         On
 the other     hand,   if  the quantity of dust varies              much,   it  necessitates
 a change     of measure to meet the changing conditions,                 a large  stopcock
 being necessary when the air is pure, and a small one when dusty.
     In gauging    the bore of these stopcocks,               for the large sizes      I   have
 generally used measurement               and checking by gauging              with water.
 The small ones have been gauged by means of wires.                          The bore was
 first drilled a   little smaller than it was ultimately to               be,     From this
 bore the length was got which enabled the proper diameter                         to be de
 termined.       The following plan of determining the diameter was found
  of  easy application      : — Take     the case      of   the   stopcock sketched in
 Plate    III.   The length of the larger of the two bores was                   2 cm.,     and
 it  was required to have a capacity of               V  c.c.    From a bundle of steel
 wires of different sizes one was selected, the volume of which was
  1 c.c.  per 10 cm. of its length.            This    was ascertained      by selecting a
  wire which, when dipped into            a burette nearly full of water, displaced
  1 c.c. per 10 cm. of its length.           The bore in the plug of the stopcock
 ¦was   then   made to fit this wire exactly, and, as the bore                      is 2 cm.
  long, its capacity     will    be \ c.c.

                                         The   Air- Pump.
     Turning now          to the air-pump used for producing an expansion                                  in
the      test^receiver,    and shown at            P, Plate I.             The one used has a
capacity of 150 cc.                  There     is no necessity for the pump being
exactly of that size, hut its capacity should bear a certain proportion
to the air-contents of the             receiver, and be such as to make the neces
sary calculations         as   simple    as possible.          It   may be thought              that the
pump is rather large, and that we might with advantage reduce the
size of both pump and receiver.                     But it must           be remembered            that    if
we reduce them, then the measuring apparatus must be reduced also                                            ;
and as the measure              is reduced to as small dimensions as is thought
advisable, there would require to be some good reason for change in
this direction.           No doubt, with            a pump large                compared       with the
receiver, the degree of expansion is more trying on the joints and stop
cocks than       if   a smaller pump were used             ;   and there is also           a   tendency
to spontaneous condensation when the expansion produced by                                         a large
pump is employed.                    Yet, in spite of          these        disadvantages,           it is
thought desirable to use a large pump, as the high expansion gives
a great fall in temperature,                 and thus causes the raindrops                         which
descend on the stage to be larger and more easily counted than                                        if   a
smaller pump were used.
     With the pump of                 a capacity     of   150       cc,     and the receiver a
capacity of 350           cc,    the calculations are easily made.                          Whatever
number        is counted on the stage per square                           mm.        requires to be
multiplied by           100     to    get the number per                  cc    in    the air of the
receiver, and this multiplied by 500 — that by the contents of the  is,
                   —
receiver and pump gives the total number in the measured quantity
of air sent into       the apparatus.           Suppose, for instance,                 that    1   cc. of
dusty air was measured and sent into the receiver, and                                if   we counted
2   drops per square mm., then as there was                                1    cm.    of air above
the stage, there would be 200 drops per                              cc         of the air in the
receiver;      but as the original             1   cc     of air          was    mixed with 350
cc  of pure air, and expanded to 500           there will      cc,                         have     been

          =         dust particles in the original   cc.                        1
    If   we had mixed only                   cc    of the dusty air, and got the same
number of drops, then the number of particles would have been ten
times greater, or 1,000,000;                 but   if   we had used 10               cc. and got the

same number            of drops, then the number of particles would                           have
been one-tenth,          or 10,000.
    We     can    test    air    having       any of these        quantities       in it with
the    small cylinder           measure.       But    suppose      that, with       10    cc        of
the dusty air, the particles are too few for easy counting, then we
will require      to send more than 10            cc. into the     receiver.       To do this,
the stopcock       F     is turned against the stop H3, the stopcock of the
receiver is closed and a stroke of the pump is made                            ;   this takes a
certain quantity of air out of the receiver,                        and,    on opening the
receiver stopcock, air from the source to be tested                            rushes        in to
supply its place.           This   is   mixed with the air in the           receiver,     expan
sion is made, and the drops are counted, all as usual.                         If the number
of particles has not been too great, all of them will have been thrown
down, and the receiver stopcock may be again opened, and another
quantity      taken       in, mixed, expanded, and counted, and so on                            till
the required number of tests has been made to give                          a good average.
     We must now know the quantity of dusty air taken in at each of
these tests before we can calculate the number of particles                         in the air.
The capacity of the receiver is 350 cc. and of the pump 150 cc.                                The
pump therefore takes out                       °f the whole air of the         receiver      —
                                        350
                                              105 cc
                                        g^j--105  cc
Practically only          100    cc. of air      is required to replace that taken               out
by the pump.             The     reason    of this     is,   the theoretical quantity does
not really come out with each stroke of the pump, owing to the
pressure      required to open the pump valve preventing the escape of
the last   5     cc,   and probably partly owing to the expansion producing
a   greater cooling effect on the larger mass of air in the receiver than
on the smaller one in the pump, — the smaller mass more quickly
recovering ite heat from the enclosure.
      "When working         with the       apparatus     in this way, at each test there
is    taken into the receiver              100   cc    of the air to be tested;              this   is
mixed with 250            cc     of pure air, and the whole           is   then expanded to
500     cc,      so that the number counted on the stage, in this case,
requires to be multiplied by only                 5   to get the number        of particles in
the air tested.           It    may be as well to note that, after making the
stroke of the pump, the piston must be pushed                          back again        ;   other

-wise     more than         100     cc     of air will be taken in, and an unknown
quantity will         pass out into the pump.
     But     suppose that the particles are                      still   too wide apart, or that we
wish      to check our results, and we desire to get a greater quantity of
dusty air into the              receiver, then all that is necessary, after making the
expansion and counting the drops, is to open the receiver stopcock,
as before, to allow the air to enter, and then work the pump for some
time,     say making fifteen or twenty strokes ;                         in this way we can clear
the purified air out, and fill the                 receiver       entirely with which'we wish to
test.     When working in this                  way, the numbers counted on the stage re
quire to be multiplied by                  1   '43, to allow for the effect of the expansion.
     We have        seen, then, how we can, by means of the small cylinder,
measure any quantity of the air to be tested from                                       ^    cc. to 10 cc.     ;
and also how, by            means         of the air-pump, we can measure 100 cc,                             or
cause the receiver to                   be filled entirely with the dusty air. There                          is
 evidently,        however, too great                a step        between the largest              quantity
 measured          by the small cylinder measure                              and the contents of the
 large pump — that                is,   from 10          cc    up to 100          cc.       To bridge over
 this interval, the air-pump has                         a    scale attached to the             piston-rod,
 and     sliding     with it.            On this         scale    is     marked, not the quantity
 displaced by the piston, but the quantity taken out of the receiver
 by the pump, when the receiver stopcock                                 is   closed.       When provided
 with this scale, we need not always take in 100                                  cc    ;   but, by making
 a   partial stroke, we may take in, say 50                         cc        of dusty air, or any other
 quantity we may desire.                       In this way        a      perfectly graduated         scale    is
 obtained,      and we can send into the receiver any measured quantities
 of dusty air we may desire from                             ^ cc        to 100 e.c, or even          fill   the
 receiver      full of the air to          be tested.
     It   may be asked,            Why not          graduate        the pump to actual displace
 ment, and open the receiver stopcock before                                       making the stroke           1
 The objection to this plan                        is,   that some of the dusty air would
 escape      with the pure air while                     the stroke was being made, and wo
 should not have any means of knowing how much was lost.
     Another plan for                   measuring large             quantities          of air with the

number of c.c. have left the vessel and entered                          the receiver,         the
receiver stopcock is opened, and the water flows out and draws in
the dusty air, the stopcock             T being     closed when the water returns
to its original level.       Which of        these plans is the best         I leave      to the
operator    ;   but it is always well to vary one's way of working, as it
tends to keep us free from errors,                 and for this reason            alone     this
method may be occasionally used.
                                       Tlie Gasometer.
     The gasometer        sketched on Plate        I. is of the usual construction.
The only points specially attended to are                       a    nice balance,      ease    of
movement,        and an accurately graduated scale.                  The scale is in litres
and percentages.            The     gasometer       has    a    capacity     of    20     litres.
Attached to the gasometer              is the filter F, and inside the gasometer
is   a   stirrer for mixing the filtered and unfiltered airs.                      The gaso
meter has a number of duties to perform.                       It   is used as an aspirator
for circulating       the air through           the measuring           apparatus.         It   is
used for testing very dusty air, such as that from flames, when the
smallest quantity measurable              by the apparatus described would give
a cloud     of particles far too dense for counting.                    The impure air is
drawn into the gasometer mixed with a known quantity of filtered
air, and sent through the measuring apparatus                         to be tested in the
usual way in the receiver.              The gasometer has also been found very
useful for making check experiments, and for trying the working of
the different parts of the apparatus.               For    instance,     in comparing the
results given by different ways of working, it was soon found that
the number of particles           in   the outside air was far too variable to make
it suitable for experiments of this kind.                 Air with the     desired amount
of dust was, therefore, put into the gasometer and thoroughly mixed,
and the tests were made with               it     Allowance,         of course, had to be
made for the gradual diminution                 of the dust during the experiments,
and errors from this cause checked by working the different plans
alternately a number of times.

used to shield the observer          as much as possible when a strong light
is employed.        For concentrating the light            on the stage a globular
flask  full of water may        be used, or a short focussed           glass lens, such
as the condenser of a magic lantern, may be employed
                                  General Remarks.
    In  beginning       work     with   the apparatus,        the first thing to be
 attended to is the counting stage.             If  bright,    it is carefully dusted
only, but it is generally polished        every time before use.           This is done
 either with a buff wheel with             rouge,   and finished on          a   woollen
wheel,     or   it is rubbed on         a piece    of chamois        leather stretched
 on a flat surface, a very little rouge          being used, and the polishing
being finished with         a clean piece   of leather.      In polishing the      stage,
the rubbing should be all done in straight lines along the engraved
 lines  on the plate, as previously directed             ;  it   need not, however,
 be always along the same lines.            When properly polished, the             plate
 should have      a brilliant black appearance,       if   one may use the expres
 sion ; this enables the counting to be easily done.                      The rubbings
 must on no account be done circularly, as is usual in polishing silver,
 nor must it     be done     in straight lines  at any considerable angle to the
 engraved lines, or the rubbing              marks will be distinctly            visible,
 destroying the perfect blackness of the mirror, and making counting
 difficult    To save the frequent polishing required by silver, platinum
 and other metals are now under trial.
    Having polished the mirror, and             been   careful to keep its surface
 free from dust specks, we put            it into its socket in the top of the
 supporting pipe D, and D is put into its place in the receiver.                     The
 stage is then adjusted so that the corners of the squares point to the
 light     In that position it should look quite black, and the lines be
 distinctly visible on it. It is probable that all the little squares will
 not be perfect. Owing to imperfections in the metal, &c, little specks
 will be visible in different        places ; but as there are more than one
 hundred     squares,     the most perfect are selected            for observing and
 counting the drops.           The stopcock on the entering pipe O is now
 connected with the measuring apparatus and closed.                          The stop
 cock  T is   opened,     and the pump worked           till the water entering by

wet    the      sides       of the receiver                and the        paper         covering         thetop
along its outer edges.                     If    the outer edges get wet, the                        water soon
spreads all over it.                  The necessity             for an occasional             wetting         inside
explains why the receiver is connected with the measuring apparatus
by means of           a piece         of indiarubber tubing.                 The disc         I    can be     easily
wetted from time to                   time by drawing it down into                      the water         beneath
it.    The air in the receiver is now purified by pumping                                                     in air
through the filter, and finally by expansion and consequent throvcin^:
down of particles by showers of rain, filtered air being admitted after
each shower.                If                                 rapidly
                                 all the joints are air-tight, condensation
ceases, and after a few showers not a drop will be seen falling when
expansion is made.     The counting stage should now be attended to.
If it is clewed, then the mouth of the operator should be applied to
the tube        U,    and warm air blown through it.                                   This rapidly warms
the stage and clears it.                    If       the stage should be troublesome                      to keep
clear of dew, it is an indication                          that the water in the receiver is too
cold   ;   that      is,   too cold for the temperature                      of the upper part of the
receiver.        Some water ought therefore to be run out, and some                                       slightly
heated water added                    to that in the receiver.                    Too much             hot water
must not be added,                    or the drops           rapidly evaporate before they can
be counted.                The best condition seems to                       be   when the stage tends
slightly to get dewed, and                           requires     an occasional             blow through the
tube       U   to clear it.           In   that condition the drops remain visible some
time, and are easily counted.
      Supposing the air to                      be    perfectly pure, and               the stage         in good
working order, we may then proceed                                  to testing the air.                  The first
thing done, after seeing                         that the air           is   circulating through                    the
apparatus,           is    to close        the receiver           stopcock,        and then            make         one
stroke of the air-pump, and                            push the piston back to the bottom
position.         A        quantity of the air to                 be tested       is   then measured, say
 by the small cylinder                      measure, and sent                  into     I).        The    receiver
stopcock         is   then       opened,         and       the air rushing             in from the            filter,
 carries       the dusty air with                it    into the receiver.               After this         is   done
 the receiver stopcock                 is   closed, and the stirrer            I       is   rapidly moved up
and down two or three times.                               This    is   done      by grasping the lower
 end of the indiarubber                     tube       M    and    moving         it    up and down             ;   the
 indiarubber tube expands and contracts,                                 and allows the stirrer to be
 worked        as easily         as
                                      if

length of the tube M is such that its elasticity keeps the diaphragm
I  at its top position, and against the stop R.                  The pure and impure
airs having been thoroughly mixed, expansion is made, a shower of
rain produced, and the drops counted.
    We must now consider what is the                 best quantity of dusty air to
be sent into the receiver for making                  a test.      When     beginning       a
new test, we have to be guided by experience as to what is likely
to be the correct quantity.                Suppose we think that           2 c.c.   will   be
enough, that quantity is accordingly measured and tested, and from
the density of the condensation produced by that quantity, we get
an idea as to whether it is too little or too much.                     But what is        to
too little and what too much             ?   A little  experience soon settles this
point   ;  but   1  may state that       if more    than     5  drops fall per square
mm., there is too much dust, not only because when the number is
 much above          5    there is a difficulty in counting them            before    they
 evaporate,     if the      stage  be   slightly hot, but       also  because,   with      so
 large a number, we cannot be quite sure that all the particles have
 been thrown down.              Suppose, for instance, that 10 drops fell per
 square mm.;        if   we now admit only filtered air, and again make an
 expansion, we shall find that some drops will make their appearance,
 showing that some particles have escaped the first condensation.                          It
 has, therefore, been the practice to limit the maximum number of
 drops to     5   per square mm.            With that number no drops               appear
 on a second        expansion being made.            The lower limit, however, is
 not so definite       ; there   is nothing in the conditions limiting us here               ;
 it is simply       a question      of convenience     ;   1   per square    mm. makes
 a fairly good          lower limit.       When working with that number,                   I
 generally use 4 squares instead of              1.    By taking the number that
 falls  on the 4 squares, we get a better average.                     The number          so
  obtained is multiplied          by 25 to get the number per c.c.                We      are
  not, however, limited to           1 or even   4 squares,     occasionally    9 squares
 have     been    used, and       the number that fell on these              9 observed.
  Working with          so large a surface requires some care.            We have first
 to select   a  part of the stage where there are                9  squares   all perfect
 and spotless.         The    eye is steadily kept       on   the   square   of   9  small
 ones, and a      little practice     enables  us to count the number that               fall
 on that area.          I need    not say that    9  squares      are only used      when
 the drops are very few, say 6 or 7, over the whole area                  ; if more fall,

then we had better restrict our attention to             4 squares.    For general
work, however,        5 per square    mm. is the top, and      1 per square         mm.
the lower limit.        It   is for this  reason   that in the set of stopcock
measures described, their capacities have been fixed at something                    like
this proportion.        The sizes of these measures are 5 c.c,         1  c.c.,    \ cc,
and    ^  cc.      The second last one is not £ of the next largest, but it
is of a size that makes the calculations easy.               The largest measure
requires the number per c.c. counted on the stage to be multiplied
 by 100, the next by 500, the next by 2000, and the last by 10,000.
    It may be as well here to call attention to the necessity of making
all joints in the apparatus perfectly air-tight, and all stopcocks must
be of first-class workmanship, as         it is found that any     leak that allows
air to pass, also allows dust to get in along with          it   No hole between
metal surfaces       seems to be too small for dust to pass through, or                 is
it that no hole that cannot          pass dust  will  pass air, owing to the dust
particles sticking and closing the passage to the air            ?
    I  shall    now refer to a precaution            necessary   in working          this
apparatus.       If  the air in the place where we are working                is damp
and nearly saturated,          care  must be taken in opening the receiver
stopcock.       It  must be done very gradually, so that the air may enter
slowly.      If  opened     to the full extent suddenly, the dusty air in
the entering pipe is expanded, condensation takes place                          on   the
dust,    the drops formed in the pipe are               driven violently          by the
rush of air, and many adhere to the surfaces with which they come
in contact.       This   effect only takes    place when the air is very damp,
otherwise the expanded air is not cooled                to its condensing point
before entering the receiver.           This condensation in the entering pipe
 is greatly due to the resistance of the cotton-wool filter preventing the
air rushing in to supply the partial vacuum.                A filter of    large area
is therefore     desirable as a prevention of errors of this kind              ;  but as
 even a large filter     will not entirely prevent condensation,         a  little   care
must always be taken to open the receiver stopcock slowly when the
 air is damp.
    The difficulty above referred to was met on the first occasion on
 which    I  made     tests away from the laboratory.            These teste were
 made in winter        in an outhouse, and when the atmosphere               was very
 damp.      In   a  great number of tests the numbers counted on the
 stage varied to an amount far exceeding any previous experience.

At    first it  was difficult to say whether the difference           in the numbers
counted      was due to a real difference        in  the impurities of the air.        A
greenhouse fire, at a considerable distance to the windward, suggested
it might       be so, and on some occasions,           no doubt, there was a real
difference      due to this cause     ;  but   as  the great variation continued
after the wind        changed,   another explanation had to be found.                  It
was then noticed that the manner of admitting the air to the receiver
 had an influence.        After   repeated trials,     it was found that      if the air
 was admitted with         a rush far fewer drops were counted              than when
 it was allowed to flow in slowly         ; but which, if either, of the numbers
 counted under these two conditions was the correct                     one ]    It  had
 previously      been   observed    that    if  the air was allowed to rush in,
  and in its passage strike the surface of water,                 nuclei were manu
  factured, and generally that violent curreuts of air have                 a tendency
  to produce centres of condensation.            But in the case above referred to,
  the slowest moving air gave the greatest                number of drops.         Were
   nuclei formed under some unknown                 conditions   !  or was it possible
   that when the air enters with a rush the expansion in the entrance
   tube is sufficient to cause condensation before entering the receiver,
   if the air is moist?     To  settle this point, the method of working was
   altered.    The air was not allowed to go into the receiver immediately
   after expansion was made, but water was allowed to enter by the pipe
   T.    The stopcock by which the air enters was then opened full, and
   the outflowing water drew the air slowly into the receiver,                  through
   wide open passages and without           a  rush.    By this plan we could trust
   that no particles were formed by the movement                   of the air, and no
    expansion produced in the entrance pipe sufficient to cause condensa
   tion in even nearly saturated air.           When tried, it     was found that the
   numbers obtained by this plan of working                 correspouded     with those
   got when the air was admitted slowly.                   The numbers,       therefore,
   obtained when the air was allowed to rush in were too small, and
   the smallness must have been due to the air losing some of its dust
   in  the process by forming raindrops while             still in the entrance     pipe.
       The time required to make a test need not be great                ; indeed,   con
    sidering the numbers we have             to deal with, we may say         it is very
    short    To put the apparatus         together    and ready for work need not
   take more than five minutes, more or less, according to the expertness
   of the operator.      After it  is   in working     order, half a minute is quite

enough for one test        ; so we can make           ten tests to get a good average
in five minutes,     or, let us say, a quarter of an hour for everything.
                 Residts Obtained with the New Apparatus.
     In my first communication            on this subject, there was given a table
in which is      entered    the number of particles in the atmosphere                              of
this district, and the number in air polluted with the products of
combustion.     These numbers have been checked by means of the
new apparatus,      and found to be practically correct.                            For air from a
Bunsen flame, different numbers have been obtained, depending on
the manner of collecting the products;                   but the one entered                  in the
table is not the highest that has been observed.                            For the air of the
laboratory the results are very variable,                    but those given in the
table are not a bad average,                and the        same        may be said of the
numbers given for the outside air.
     Confining our attention now to the outside air, a great number of
tests have      been made      here, and the condition of the                        air   has been
found to vary greatly, the smallest number                              observed           per cubic
centimetre is 11,000;          frequently there are 50,000 to                            70,000 par
ticles per c.c, and as many as 140,000 per c.c. have been counted.
     These numbers are very great, and one naturally asks the question,
How many of         these    particles are what we might call natural, and
what proportion is due to artificial causes? The situation, where
                                                                 "
these tests were made, is what might be called " in the country.
It   is quite outside of the town of                  Falkirk.         It     is,   however,     sur
rounded on many sides by public works, and in most directions there
are villages at greater         or less distances.           It       is,   therefore, very evi
dent that the air at this situation must be very much polluted by
artificial causes.   I      was constantly reminded of this while making
 my tests.        At no     great   distance there         is
                                                           a      railway, and when an
 engine   passed,   if    the wind was from that direction, the particles
 would suddenly increase in number, and for                       a   short time become            60
 great   it   was impossible to count them.
     Now that the apparatus          was     in   a   satisfactory working condition,
it   seemed desirable that the investigation should                          be extended,        and
 tests bo made of the air at other places.                  The first point to which
attention was given was to find out what the number                                 is   in air under
natural conditions — that           is,   free from all artificial pollution.                    For

  this purpose a situation was sought which, while it could be easily
  got at, would     yet be as far removed from human habitations                   as
  possible.   Attention     was  afterwards      directed to the condition         of
  the air in densely populated areas.
     The best   set of observations      I  have yet obtained, in what may
  be  called pure air, were       taken at Colmonell,        in January of this
  year.   During    my  visit of   a few days there were examples         of most
 types of weather.      I may mention       that Colmonell is a small village
 in the south of Ayrshire, and           is  situated in a pastoral       district,
 which is very thinly      peopled.     During most of     the time of my visit
 the wind was southerly, and the air tested must have been fairly
 free from artificial pollution, as it had travelled from 20 to 40 miles
 — according    to the direction   — over the   bare and uncultivated       hills of
 Wigtown     and  Kirkcudbright before it arrived at the testing           place.
     Along with this paper        is given a table      showing the results of
 recent observations.       In  the table is entered      the place    of the ob
servation, the date, and the hour when the tests were made.                     The
results are given in numbers per cubic centimetre, and also per cubic
inch of the air — the     state of the weather at the time being entered
 in the last column of     the table.    By   a referenco   to the table,   it will
 be   seen  that the Colmonell         observations show the air          of that
situation to be very free from dust, and that the air near Falkirk is
very highly polluted by artificial causes.
     We shall now discuss      the Colmonell      observations in detail.         It
will   be seen from the table that the morning of the 7th, when the
observations began, was foggy.           This    fog was general all over the
country.     The number of particles counted at 10 a.m. on that day
was 5350 per c.c.       As the day advanced the fog cleared away, and
the number of particles fell to 2500, or about one-half of what it
was in the morning.        Next morning      (the 8 th) was    dull and  wet, and
the numbers went up to about what they were on the morning of
the previous day.        The day continuing         very stormy and wet, the
air became very thick.        On testing at    5   p.m. the dust particles were
found to have increased, and the number now was 9500.                 On the 9th
but few observations could be made, owing to the direction of the
wind bringing the smoke of the village in the direction of the testing
place.    On the morning of      the 10th there was a slight shower          ;  the
air was clear, and the sun bright.         By  12 o'clock the great    impurity

of the previous day had greatly decreased, and the                               number now
counted      was   1650.         The day continued fine, with transparent                       air
and bright sun      ;    and when tested at              1 p.m. the     number was   only     5O0
per c.c.     After this hour            the tests were unreliable, owing             to change
of wind bringing the smoke towards the place of observation.
     The night of the 10th was frosty                   ;   but the next morning opened
dull, and the air was thick.                   The number of particles was           found to
be 4000      per c.c.      The day got stormy and                    duller, the thickness in
the atmosphere          increased a good deal, and                   when tested at 3 p.m. it
was      found to contain 9250                particles per c.c.          The air got clearer
towards night,          and at 11 p.m. the              number was reduced to less than
one-half.      This clearing continued,                  and      next morning the air was
quite clear, and the number of particles was down to 625 per c.c.
     From an examination of these Colmonell                              observations, it    will
be noticed that on these occasions                          there   was a direct connection
between     the transparency of the air and the number of dust particles
in it.     When    the air was clear and transparent,                      the number   fell to
500 or 600 per c.c, when                it    was thick the number rose to 5000 per
c.c; and when it          was very thick             and hazy, the number was nearly
double that.       It will       also be seen from the table that rain had                  little
or no effect on the occasions these tests were made.                            The 8th was     a
wet, stormy day, with thick air                  ;   and the number was as high as on
the 11th, when there was no rain, and the air not quite saturated.
     We cannot draw              any    very satisfactory conclusions from these
Colmonell observations,               as they are far too few for anything              like    a
stable     foundation.          It    was, however,          distinctly observed     while the
tests were being made, that there was a direct relation between the
numbers      counted       and       the transparency             of the air.   Before making
each succeeding         test,   it   was found possible to say whether the number
would be greater or less than the preceding,                             by simply observing
the clearness of the distant                  hills.*        It   would, however, be rash to
     *
     Though there was a close relation between the transparency of the air ami
the number of dust particles in          it,
                                    during these Colmonell observations, yet                   it
is evident that we will not be entitled to expect this relation to hold good
under all conditions.  The amount of vapour in the atmosphere, or rather the
degree of saturation            will have an effect on the size of the particles,
                          of the air,
more especially when the air      nearly saturated.
                                         is            We are, therefore, only
entitled to expect this relation to hold good while the degree of saturation
remains constant, which   probably did during these observations, the air being
                                it
nearly saturated during most of the time.

1888-89.]               Mr John Aitken           on Dust Particles.                      161
conclude         that all atmospheric           haze   is due to duet       ;  yet these
indications are worth keeping in view for future                         consideration.
It                                        "
       seems     possible that the           alpine haze," about which           so much
correspondence          has lately appeared in Nature, may be due to dust.
This, however, can be determined only by actual observation.                          There
is another        point of vast importance in the             economy      of nature, to
which attention            ought to be directed, which is this.                If   further
investigation        should prove that the transparency of               the air is due
to its freedom         from dust, then we would be inclined to think that
the diathermancy            of the air will     also have a close connection with
 the    quantity of dust in        it   These two points seem worthy of future
 investigation.
      Our interest       in  the matter,     however,   does not end here.          If  dust
 should really prove to be a good absorber of the sun's heat, then                         it
 will also be a most important                 factor in the formation of fogs in
  another way       than    has been already pointed out.           If tho atmosphere
  was    perfectly     diathermanous,         then probably       we should       have    nn
  fogs.    Because tbe cooling of the air at night would be done entirely
  hy the cold radiating           bodies at the earth's      surface ; the air passing
  over these      cold surfaces would be robbed of its moisture as well                    as
  of its heat, and would thus be prevented from becoming                       saturated.
  As fogs    are  formed during calm weather, they cannot at all situations
  be caused      by the mixture of hot and cold saturated airs, but must fre
   quently be produced by radiation from the atmosphere                   itself.      Now,
   if dust is a good absorber,         it will  also be a good radiator ; and, as a
   consequence,      an abundance of dust in the            atmosphere     will    at night
   cause   it  to be  rapidly    cooled to the dew-point, when a fog            will begin
   to form, and     by its formation       increase the radiating power of the air.
    The radiating power           of dust is probably one of the causes of the
    greater frequency of fogs in towns than in the country, there being
    far more dust in town than in country air.                     After condensation
    begins,    there is plenty of evidence           of the radiating power of the
    particles.     A  good    example of this is given in a letter by Mr E. J.
    Lowe, in Nature, voL xxxvii.            p. 319.      In this letter is    described     a
     remarkable     rime.     The peculiarity       was    that the thickness of the
     rime was greater      high up than low down.            At   5 feet  the length of
     the crystals was

particles doing all the radiation, and the upper                             layersprotecting
the lower ones.            The temperature            on the grass was         warmer than at
4 feet up.
     On the 5th of January observations were made on the number of
dust particles in the air at Ballantrae,                     a   small village on the coast
of Ayrshire.          This      place      was selected        with     a view of      testing the
condition of the air resting on the                     sea.        Though the day was one
in   every way suited to the purpose,                     the results are of          little value.
The wind was very slight, moving with but                               a gentle   motion     from
the south-west — that               is,   towards shore — so that the air that                   had
been resting on the sea was brought direct to the apparatus     yet                          ;
the number counted was as high as 5000 per c.c, though the air
that day was clear and bright. This large number was not caused by
any artificial impurities, as the place of observation was close to the
shore and within 50 yards of the water.                          The great number counted
was evidently         in   part due to the action of the small waves breaking
on the shore.              Though         very small, little        more    than   a   ripple, yet
these waves manufactured                   a   vast quantity of water particles, which,
though they might dry, would yet leave                         a   salt particle as residue.
     One would scarcely              have      expected      this result from such small
waves, and we might have felt inclined to accept the number                                       as
correct for sea air.            Owing, however, to the atmospheric conditions,
I    was able to observe that the very small waves were manufacturing
vast    numbers of particles.                  The day was very clear, with bright
sunshine     ;   and on looking along the shore-line close                      to the sea, the
bright sunshine disclosed                   the existence      of   a   perfectly distinct    mist
all along the shore,            where the little waves were breaking.                     With     a
stronger wind,           or    a    more     rapid evaporation, these manufactured
particles might not have                   been visible.         For observations on        sea air
it   will   be necessary        to select         calm weather, and make the tests in
a    boat    at some distance from                  shore.       The numbers          obtained    at
Ballantrae are therefore far too high for                           sea    air at the time and
place, and the impurity in the air tested there was probably                                     salt
particles.       At     sea,   if   there    is   as much wind as          will break the sur
face, there      will      be manufactured vast              quantities of salt dust, and
the number of these particles                     will probably vary with the             force of
the wind.
     During      the past year        a     great number of tests have been made of

the air     here   with the new     apparatus,   hut it is unnecessary     to refer
in    detail to the result    of  these tests, because the air here is so con
taminated by artificial        causes, that the numbers, though indicating
the condition of the air in this neighbourhood, are yet of little
general interest        I have,  however,   entered  in  the table the least and
the greatest numbers observed here.
     A few    tests were made      of the air in Edinburgh,     and    the results
are entered       in the  table.    Those tests were made at the rooms            of
the Royal Society on the Mound.                The pipe by which the air was
taken in to the apparatus was carried to the outer air, through one
of the windows,          on the west side of the building         facing Princes
Street     Gardens.      The wind at the time was blowing towards the
west     side of the building.        The result of these tests,    as   might be
expected,      show that the air in Edinburgh has a considerably greater
number of particles in it than the air of this district.                 The first
tests    were made      on 2nd February, and the last on the 5th.               The
numbers        obtained on these two days are likely to be small for
 Edinburgh,       because the air was clear and cold, with a strongish west
 wind, and heavy snow showers on the 2nd.                 On the 4th there was
  less wind, the air was not so clear, and the numbers observed rose
 considerably above what         it was on the other days.
     The apparatus was then removed to Glasgow, and tests made of
 the air there.       The situation selected for these observations was in
 Bothwell Street, which is situated         near the Central Station.        There
 is a large open space      in front of  the selected position, and the air       in
 this street will be a fair average for Glasgow.           The first of the tests
 was made       on the 8th of February.         This was a remarkably stormy
 day.     A  strong north-west wind was blowing all day, with heavy snow
 showers.       The lowest number obtained on that day was 170,000 per
c.c     It is probable,   owing to the high wind, low temperature,        and dry
air, that the air on this day was as free from dust          as it is ever   likely
to be.       Tests were again made on the 12 th.           The day was frosty,
with westerly wind, sky          clear, and air dry.      The number counted
on the 12th was double that obtained on the 8th.                On the 16th of
the month the air was again tested, and found to have even a larger
 number of particles in it than on the 12th.            A  much stronger wind
 was   blowing on      the 16th than on the 12th, and yet the numbers
 were highest       on the windy day.        This might possibly        be due to

164                   Proceedings of Royal Society             of Edinburgh.                [sess.
slight difference            in the direction of the wind, but more probably to
the dampness               of the air loading the particles,         and preventing         them
from rising           so   quickly     on the 16th.      The relative numbers for           Edin
burgh and Glasgow cannot                   be estimated      from the figures in the table.
The day when               a large     number was counted in Edinburgh               was    dull,
with little wind; whereas                  all the Glasgow observations were made
when there was more wind and the air clear.                      still damp day,
                                                                      In   a
or a foggy one, the                   number for Glasgow will probably be many
times greater than any yet obtained.
     The next set of observations                  entered    in the table refer to some
tests made in the Meeting-Room of the Royal Society on the evening
this paper w:is read.                The first observations were taken shortly before
the meeting            began at 8 p.m.             The air was tested at a height of
about 4 feet from the lloor, and also near the ceiling, the air being
drawn down through a pipe by means of the gasometer.                            Xear the
floor the air before the meeting                  began had    275,000 particles per c.c,
or very little             above that of the air outside on that day.                 Near the
ceiling         the    number was              3,000,000.    After    an       hour and three
quarters the numbers                    were    found to have        increased     to 400,000
near the floor, and                 3,500,000 near the ceiling.            These tests were
cheeked the following                  day, and the numbers      are entered in the table.
It   will   be seen        that the results were somewhat similar.                The increase
in the numbers was very much the same, though in the latter case the
gas had been burning a little longer than                       in   the former.       It   is,   of
course, the increase in number, and not the numbers themselves, that
have to be noted here.
     It   may be as well to state that the Meeting-Room                          of the Royal
Society         is   lighted by means of          two sets of open lights, and each set
is   provided with             a   ventilator immediately over it.         This accounts      for
the small increase in the number of particles                       while the gas was burn
ing.        Most of the increase which took place was probably due to two
side lights which have no ventilators over them.                           It will   be noticed
that there was             a   large number of particles in the air near the ceiling
of the Meeting-Room, not only while the gas was burning, but also
on        the    morning           after the     meeting.     The    cause      of these    large
numbers          is   greatly due to the ventilators projecting downwards to
some distance               from the ceiling       ;   the air near the ceiling does not
therefore get the benefit of the circulation, and                       the particles rising

from the       two side lights get collected in the upper space.                From
trie tests     it would appear that this hot polluted air had remained all
night,     as on   testing next morning it had lost only about one half of
its    particles.
      By way of illustration,     I   have    made some tests of the air        in  an
ordinary room while          gas was burning, but where there are no venti
 lators over the gas.         As will   be seen from the next numbers          in  the
 table, the contrast is very marked, and show that the ventilators in
 the Meeting-Room           of the Royal      Society do their work efficiently.
  The results of this series of tests are given in the table, and show in
  a marked way the effect of burning gas on the purity of the air of
  an ordinary room such as we are accustomed               to live in.   These tests
  were    made     here in a room 24 feet long by          17  broad and 13 high.
  There is a fireplace, in which a good fire was burning during these
  experiments      ;  the room has two windows and two doors, and the
  polluting effect of four jets of gas was tested.
      The air outside was tested at one o'clock, and           also at three o'clock,
  when the tests began,         and the numbers         are entered    in the table.
  Before the gas was lighted, the air in the room was tested at a height
  of 4 feet from the floor, and near the ceiling, and was found to have
  very nearly the same number of particles as the outside                air, as will
  be seen from the figures         in   the table.     The air near      the  ceiling
  seemed to have slightly less than that near the floor.               This point    I
  checked twice, and always found the higher air the purer.                       The
  lower number in the air from near the ceiling would partly be due
  to the    air losing    some of its particles     in  the pipe by which      it was
  drawn down to the apparatus.
      After    these   tests were made      the gas was lighted at 3 p.m.         The
  rapidity with which the        products     spread through the room was very
  remarkable.        By  the time I had   lighted all the jets and turned to the
  apparatus, the number in the air from near the ceiling had increased
  to many times its original amount.              Lower down, also, tho number
  rose very rapidly.        After an hour the air     was again tested, and found
   to be greatly polluted by the products of combustion, as              will be seen
   from the numbers given in the table taken at               4 p.m.    The air was
   again tested at 5 p.m., and, as     will  be seen, the impurity in the air near
   the ceiling     had again greatly increased.         From the table it might
   be thought       that the air at 4 feet from the floor, when tested at

166              Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                   [sew.
5 p.m.,    had less dust in it than        it had    an hour previously.           This
decrease      in the number      was, however, caused by the two tests              not
being made at the same part of the room.                   The 4 o'clock test was
made near the window, while the later one was made near the fire.
The quantity of dust in different parts of the room near the floor
varied greatly ; the apparatus showed this very clearly, and by its
means     it  was possible to trace the circulation of the air in the room.
For   instance,     at the beginning of the tests, while the apparatus was
near the window, the quantity of dust              in the air, at      4 feet from the
floor, rose at once when the gas was             lighted, and became about as
high   as   it  was later on.    This   was due to the cold window producing
a down current,          and drawing     the products from near the ceiling
towards        the  apparatus.      Again,    near   the    fire,  the number       was
frequently        much below that entered          in   the    table,    owing   to the
supply of air to that part of the room being drawn from the lower,
colder, and uncontaminated air of the apartment.
    One point which impressed me greatly in making these last teats
was the short time required to change the air near the ceiling                        of
this room, compared          with   the slow circulation          which we have re
ferred to, near the ceiling of the Meeting-Room of the Royal Society.
When the apparatus was tested before beginning                       the test last re
corded,     the number of particles       of the air in the room          was counted,
and the gas was lighted to        see  how quickly the products would diffuse
through the air of the room.            The  gas was not allowed to burn long,
but on beginning          the test about an hour after it was extinguished,
not a vestige of the products of combustion could be detected.                     This
was different from what might have been expected,                    after the experi
ence   in the Meeting-Room.           It will  be remembered          that, on making
the tests next day, the air near the ceiling was found still to contain
a very large       number of particles.        Why this difference in the two
rooms?         A   short time sufficed to clear all the products of com
bustion out of the air near the ceiling of the room here, while a
whole night seemed to have reduced the number in the other room
to only about one half.           The windows         in the room of the Royal
 Society do not go nearly up to the ceiling, whereas                      in the room
here    they rise to within a short distance of it.               Again,   some of the
difference will probably be due to a difference in the porosity of the
walls and ceilings of the two rooms.

    The rapidity with which the products of combustion are                  cleared
out of    a  room is a subject well worth investigation, and              the dast-
counting apparatus promises to be of considerable assistance                  in    the
investigation.         Apart altogether from the question of ventilation by
means     of openings, there will be in most rooms a certain amount of
circulation       through    the   plaster of the walls and ceilings,       and it
might not be a bad plan to make the plaster of our houses                             as
porous     as   possible.     If  this were done, and the space behind             the
plaster were connected           with the      open air,  an insensible circulation
of pure air would be secured.
    The air of our smoking-rooms will probably contain a very great-
number of particles.             As   yet,   however,    I  have   made  no actual
determination of the number.               I  may, however, mention     that  I find
a cigarette     smoker sends 4,000,000,000 particles, more or less,             into
the air   with     every puff ho makes.           As this   smoke is not very   hot,
it  does not tend to keep          near the     ceiling like the products of com
bustion, and must therefore make the air breathed by the smokers
very full of particles.
    It will    be observed     that the smallest number of particles entered
in the table is 500 per c.c.            This    is about the lowest yet observed
in nature,       though in      some tests made        in an agricultural part of
Dumfriesshire a number slightly less was obtained.                   When testing
such pure air        as this, it does not require to be mixed with filtered
air  ; the   receiver is rilled entirely with the air to be tested.          When
the particles are so few they are             just sutiiciently far apart for easy
counting, and all of them fall with one expansion. Though one
expansion is sufficient to bring down all the dust particles in pure
country air, we must not imagine that therefore a fog could not be
 formed     in air with      so few particles.        We must not suppose      that,
 because     they are so lew, they would form rain, and all of them
 fall as in the test-receiver.         The conditions are very different     in   the
 two   cases.      The high expansion used in the testing apparatus gives
 rise to    a   considerable      cooling,     and consequent supersaturation         ;
 whereas      in nature the load of vapour tending              to condense  might
be small, and each particle only get                  enough to make     it visible.
 Five hundred         fog   particles per c.c. are quite enough         to make      a
fog, and      as these    particles may not be heavy, they may float             and
 fog the air.

                                       (Read March  18, 1889.)
     When working with the apparatus                  described in the beginning of
this paper,        it soon       became evident that, though       it was suitable for
laboratory        work, it was yet very inconvenient when observations
had to be made                on the air of places at a distance— first, because of
 its size   ; and second, because it required a house of some kind in
which it could              be fitted up and worked.        Further, in making tests
 in a house,          there is always the difficulty of local contamination.
 We may select the place of observation as carefully as possible, yet
  the house we          select can almost never be in a situation towards which
  the products         of combustion from        some neighbouring house, or even
  from the selected           house itself, may not be driven by some direction
   of wind.       As     a  result of this,  we may not be able to make any tests
   of the air when the            wind is from certain directions.
       It  therefore        became desirable, for testing the pure air of the
   country, and for examining              the air at places at a distance, that some
   portable    form      of the apparatus      be constructed — one which could be
   easily   carried       by one     person,  and which could be worked in the
   open air, so        that the observer might carry it to a situation some
    where to the         windward of human habitations or other               sources of
    pollution.      With this object in view,           I  have  prepared     designs    of
    a portable    instrument which can be packed into a small space, and
    be easily   carried.
        The portable apparatus is shown            in Plate IV., which    is drawn    full
    size.    As will be seen, the instrument is simply a rearrangement                    of
    the apparatus          already described, but on a smaller scale, and with
    some slight     modifications.        All the sizes in this apparatus are reduced
     to  ^th   the size      of the  one previously described.      In Plate IV., K       is
     the receiver,     in this case made of brass with a glass cover.         Part of the
     glass cover,   the two sides of the diaphragm, and the bottom are covered
     ¦with  blotting-paper         cemented   on them.       This   paper   is used     for
      holding   the     water     required for saturating the air tested          in   the
      receiver.    The receiver has a capacity of 35 c.c, exclusive of the
      space occupied       by the wet blotting-paper.        The stage, the inlet and
      the  outlet   pipes, all occupy the same positions as before ; the dia
      phragm, however,          in this case, when stirTing the air, has to be
       moved in      the    space   over the counting stage,      and not below          it.

The diaphragm, as in the other instrument,                   is moved by      a rod,
surrounded by an indiarubber tube.               This rod is not shown in the
drawing, owing to its position being at right angles to the section                    ;
A    is the air-pump, which has a capacity of 15 c.c. ; the piston-
rod is graduated       in this   case to its displacement, as shown         ;  S is a
stopcock, bored as shown           ;  M  is the apparatus for measuring the
air to be tested, while      F  is the filter.
    It will   be noticed, that    in this instrument we          have  adopted the
stopcock plan, for measuring small quantities of air, which was de
scribed in the first part of this paper.           The method of working has,
however, been so far improved that              it is not   necessary by the new
arrangement      to change the measuring apparatus              when we require to
use a larger or smaller quantity          of dusty     air.    As will be seen, the
different measures       are arranged      in  series,   and we can use any of
them without making any alteration in the apparatus.
     In  this portable apparatus,      as in the other one, the pump is used
when we require to mix large quantities of dusty air with the air in
the receiver, and the measure            M is    used for small quantities.         If
 1  c.c. of dusty air is required to be sent into the receiver, then, after
sufficient time has been allowed for the filtered air to enter the
 recoiver,   and when the pressure         inside the receiver is the same as
 outside, but not before, the stopcock is turned quarter a turn from the
 position shown, by this means the receiver                 is put in direct con
 nection with      the outer air.       The piston of the air-pump is now
 drawn down to the figure         1  on the scale    ; by this means    1 c.c. of the
 air is taken into the receiver, where           it is mixed with pure air and
 tested.     Two, or perhaps      three, cubic centimetres may be measured
 in this way; but if       more    is required, then the stopcock S must be
 closed before the piston is drawn down, otherwise some of the dusty
 air might be      taken out of the receiver by the pump, the piston
 of   the pump should be pushed back to the top before                 the stopcock
 is opened to admit the air.           When the stopcock is closed while the
 pump is used as a measure, allowance must be made for the expan
 sion of the air, as already explained.*
    * After a considerable
                              amount of practice with this apparatus, I find it
  better always to close the stopcock beforo drawing down the piston, even when
 only 1 c.c. of air is required. The graduation of the pump ought therefore to
  be made to show the amount of air taken out of the receiver while the stop
 cock is closed.

   For measuring quantities less than 1 c.c, the " battery " of stop
cock M is used.     The following are the sizes of the bores in the
plugs of the different measures : —
                                         Diameter.                        Length.                   Capacity.
    Large plug,                          461      mm.                     15 mm.                   250 c.mm.
    Medium plug,                         2   53 mm.                       10 mm.                    50 c.mm.
    Small plug,                          1-27 mm.                            8    mm.                10 c.mm.
That is, their          capacities           are respectively                \,         and jj^j of                a    cubic
centimetre,        so that, in working                      with these measures,                    the numbeT
counted         per c.c. of the air in the receiver requires to be multiplied
by 200 for the large measure, by 1000 for the medium, and by 5000
for the smallest measure.
    When using the portable apparatus, it is supported on                                                      a       tripod
stand.  Two plans are shown in Plate IV. for doing this.                                                               Fig.    1
shows the design first made,                           and fig.          2    an alteration afterwards
adopted.          In   fig. 1,     T     is the   " head" of             the tripod.           The upper end
of the pump is provided with a flange and a nut N, by means of
which       the apparatus               is securely attached                 to the tripod when                    in    use,
but can be separated for easy carriage.                              The objection to this plan                               is,
that the tripod legs require to be at least                                  4    feet long.        Under               most
conditions this         is   no disadvantage,               but, when much coach or railway
travelling has to be done,                   a   bundle of rods that length                        is   a   consider
able   inconvenience.                   No doubt,       a     folding tripod might be adopted,
but    it   was thought better                   to make        the stand like               a     walking-stick
3   feet long, so that             it   might be an assistance in walking, and at the
same time easily packed for carriage along                                   with umbrellas and sticks.
In order to carry out this                        idea,       the plan shown                   in       fig.       2     was
designed.         A    is    the air-pump as before                      ;    B    is   a   metal support, to
the top of which the air-pump                          is   securedmovable screw-joint,
                                                                             by   a
while its lower                                                      " head " T. The
                        end        is   securely fixed to the tripod
pump      is    separated from the support                      B    when packed for travelling.
The piston of the pump                     is    moved by means of the collar                               C,         which
slides on B.           The scale for the pump                       is    placed on           B,   as    shown at
lower end, fig.             2.      In    order to bind              the whole apparatus firmly
together,       one end of the tube               D,   fig.    2,   is   screwed        into the lower end
of the filter          F,   fig.    1,    and the other end                       is   fixed to the tripod.
When the length of the tripod                          legs   is    no objection, the plan shown
in fig.     1   seems to be the steadiest,                      whilst the other                   is     the most
convenient for travelling.

     When the plan shown on fig.                       1   is adopted, it may be advisable to
lengthen the part E, so as to bring the lower end of the stopcock S
in       a line with             the top of the tripod, and to bind the apparatus
together          by means of         a   support attached to S, and fixed to the tripod
by the nut and screw N.
      When working                  this instrument daylight is used for illuminating
the stage, and is found                    to work well        in      the open air.          A good deal
of the glass top of                   the    receiver is left uncovered with blotting-
paper to let in as much                     light   as possible          ;    and a magnifying            glass,
not shown in drawing, is used for counting the drops on the stage.
This         glass should have as             little       brass    mounting           as   possible below
the lens, so               as    not to interfere with the illumination                       of the     stage.
When working iu pure                      air, the measuring                 apparatus M is not neces
sary, and may be removed,                       and the filter screwed                      direct into the
stopcock            S.
      The whole apparatus weighs with tripod-head only                                         3   lb.   0\ oz.j
and is packed into a tin-lined                       leather case                  8x5x3      inches.       The
apparatus            with case weighs           a   little over          bh lbs., but this might be
reduced             by omitting the metal              case.        It       is,   however, easily carried
by means of                a    shoulder strap.        The legs of the tripod weigh only
15 oz.,        and when fitted together form                       a   round staff, which makes                a

alkaline    carbonates      in solution      are also, as my experiments prove,
totally unable         to  decompose       pure natural       silicate    of magnesia.
Of   conise,    it must      be  remembered         that the amount of alkaline
carbonate      in natural      waters     is very small          In the Loire,        near
Orleans, Deville was able to find only l-46 parts of carbonate                           of
soda in 100,000 parts of water          ;   while in the Garonne, near Toulouse,
the  same chemist could only detect 0*65 part of alkaline carbonate
in  100,000 of water.
    Sea-water, however, and also the waters of salt lakes and brinel
springs,    i.e.,   all waters    which     contain a considerable amount of
sodium     chloride in solution, act chemically on pure mineral mag
nesium silicates.         This fact  I have clearly      ascertained     by the follow
ing experiment.
    I allowed      a  litre of  a nearly saturated pure           aqueous solution of
pure sodium chloride to            act for two months on a              thin fragment
 (presenting      a  fairly large    surface)     of pure and thoroughly             clean
 •white steatite     (4Mg"Si03.Si02).           On the expiry of that period              I
 removed the mineral from its bath, filtered the liquid in which it
 had lain very carefully, and proceeded                to test it chemically, with
 the object of discovering whether magnesia                had     been dissolved out
 of the steatite by the action of the salt solution or not.
    I acidulated      a portion of the clear filtered       liquid with nitric       acid,
 and then added excess of ammonium hydrate, and after mixing the
 whole properly, filtered at once.               Into the filtrate      I  now poured
 some ammonium phosphate solution, agitated the mixture violently
 for several minutes, and then put it aside to allow it to                     settle for
 about a quarter of an hour.            By the end of that time             a little, but
 a very distinct, white crystalline            precipitate, indicative of the pre
 sence   of   magnesia, had      fallen to the bottom of the vessel.                  This
 white    crystalline      powder     was     afterwards      examined       under      the
 microscope, and was found to consist mainly of translucent prisms
 belonging to the trimetric system.               Thus the microscope         confirmed
 the chemical test.         The remainder of the clear solution in which
 the steatite     had lain was evaporated            to dryness,     and the sodium
 chloride and magnesium salt of the residue were completely dis
 solved out by means of dilute hydrochloric                  acid.     After this      had
 been   accomplished there         still remained       a trace     of residue which

identified as silica.
     This then                 I   consider is a clearly proved fact, that magnesia
and silica are removed in solution from mineral magnesium silicates
by the action of water containing sodium chloride.                                      A   considerable
amount therefore of the magnesia                               present in the ocean, must,                  I
believe,            have been brought into a state                  of solution by the chemical
action of the sea-water on the abundant magnesium silicate minerals
of the earth's crust.
     I have strengthened                  my belief in this matter also by experiment.
A     piece          of pure steatite was permitted to remain completely im
mersed              in   water, brought         from the North           Sea, for several months.
It   was weighed before                       being placed in the liquid, and after being
carefully dried, weighed after its removal.                                 It   was found to have
decreased                slightly in weight        ;    its second      weight was less than its
first, not much it is true, but still decidedly less.

     At      no time does Nature furnish us with                                any proof of bodies
 existing in       a   state of absolute rest.                    The whole molecular world,
 organic as well as inorganic,                    is,   as   far as we can ascertain, in con
 stant motion.              In     consequence          of this well-established                principle,
 every function of the body may rightly be considered                                      as       resulting
 from    a    change   in the molecular             state of the organ manifesting such,
 and as being the expression of                     a        correlative variation occurring in
 its representative nerve                centre.         Through        the      agency of long con
 tinuance the visceral disturbances are now carried on in                                 a     somewhat
 automatic manner, and fail to excite any feeling of their existence,
 although they may at one time, in the evolution of higher organisa
 tion, have produced               a   conscious        sensation.         In    no organ do we find

typically healthy woman this organ, so long                     as  it  is free from     the
influences of gestation and lactation, is periodically for                    a  greater or
less    length of time the seat of a regularly                    recurring     functional
variation in its molecular state, evidenced               by the emission of a more
or less marked hemorrhagic                 discharge,    and which to all intents is
its    sole   manifestation.         The disturbance          is evolved quite         inde
pendently of the will, and apart altogether from any definable
excitation.        It  appears     to be induced spontaneously               through the
agency      of an automatic nerve            centre,   and fails in consequence            to
produce any conscious            sensation.       When, however, the uterus be
comes the habitat of a developing ovum, or prior to this occurrence,
and whilst segmentation is             as  yet progressing in the Fallopian tube,
the waves of motion radiated by and from the germinal mass affect
in   a very decided manner the molecular                    state   of the uterus,       and
 determine a cessation          of its routine function, and consequently of
 its regularly       recurring     manifestation        of activity.       Impregnation
 having resulted, other well-defined symptoms, in addition to that
 of the cessation      of menstruation, are engendered,               and help not only
 to guide the woman           in arriving       at a definite conclusion regarding
 her state, but aid us very materially                 in approximately estimating
 the duration of pregnancy.
     The symptoms associated              with pregnancy to which            I  wish more
 especially to draw attention,          as evidence     of the existence of       a genera
 tive centre, and of its location in the medulla oblongata, are two —
 sickness and cough.            It   has been      alleged,    through the agency of
 experiments,      that the sexual centre is located              in the lumbar region
 of the     cord.     This opinion, however,          appears     to me to be founded
 on no very substantial basis.              The mere fact that all, or nearly all,
 the sexual phenomena           may bo witnessed in animals after the lumbar
 portion of the cord has          as  far as possible been isolated by section is
 no very special       criterion.     The respiratory centre           is located    in the
 medulla, yet under special              circumstances all the movements asso
 ciated with respiration may bo carried on after the medulla has been
  entirely removed.
     From     the   earliest   period of existence every organism has been
  endowed with two distinct qualifications                — 1st, that of maintaining
  self ;  2nd, that of perpetuating the             species.      At first, in the most
  primitive     state,  the double function           was performed by a uniform

lss*— 89.]    Dr James Oliver         on a Uterine Nerve Centre.                 177
mas3, free from any semblance of structural differentiation.               Habitual
localisation of function, however, produces eventually              a specialisation
of structure, and with      it the evolution of a nerve tract, whereby inter
dependence is maintained.            It  is therefore feasible to suppose that
the nerve centre,      which regulates the          process   of assimilation    (the
pneumogastric nerve centre), is either in close apposition, or at least
in more or    less direct communication,         with that centre which presides
over the organs of generation.            All   the visceral functions      are now
performed automatically, and appear to be regulated by nerve centres
located in the medulla oblongata.               It  is feasible, therefore, to sur
mise that the uterine functions are governed by an automatic centre
—a    centre which, because of some innate quality, is thrown                  into  a
state   of trepidation,    and produces thereby evidence of associated
disturbance in the uterus itself.
    When the uterus     becomes the nidus for a developing germinal mass,
the molecular state of the organ is altered, and certain new impulses
are generated.       The waves of motion, resulting from segmentation of
the ovum and further evolution of the chick, are radiated through the
 agency of the uterus and its afferent nerve fibres to the uterine or re
 productive    centre.    These disturbances occurring in the uterus are in
 excess of those commonly generated, so too the disturbances corre
 ctively produced in the uterine centre            are greatly   in  excess of those
 usually developed         The extra amount «f motion must discharge
 itself in some other direction until time has accustomed the uterine
 centre to the augmentation.            The direction      the overflow of energy
 shall take, is determined according to existing nerve communications,
 and that centre is likely to be first affected, by such radiations, which
 is in closest proximity.        Considering, therefore, the intimate relation
 ship that exists throughout         life between the      process of assimilation
 and the process of generation,          it  is not astonishing that the excess
 of molecular motion transmitted to the uterine                  centre   should    be
 radiated    to and expend itself          upon that governing         the nutritive
 processes generally.        In   consequence      of this there occurs early in
  pregnancy, and for a greater or less length of time, sickness, and in
  some women cough.          At present we know but little of the nervous
  mechanism of vomiting.           The respiratory centre       seems, however, to
  participate   in the   act.     Both phenomena, however (sickness and
 cough), in the pregnant woman may with some amount of assurance

  be referred to molecular radiations from the uterine to the pneumo-
  gastric centre.       Usually,     however,       in the course of       a  few months,
  through      the  agency     of habit, the          pneumogastric centre         becomes
  tolerant,    and  the symptoms evidencing                disturbance in this centre
  coetaneously     disappear.       It  is difficult     to understand why the sick
  ness should be experienced, more especially,                  although not solely, in
  the morning.       It is quite possible that the change from the recumbent
  to the erect position may after sleep render the whole nervous system
  more liable to explosive disturbances.                The state of the stomach,       too,
  may also aid in determining this somewhat anomalous                        phenomenon.
     Frequently we find epileptic patients who suffer only from their
 disturbances on assuming            the   erect position        after sleep.     The ano
 malous     phenomenon,       therefore,    as   it  occurs    in the pregnant woman
 is not without       a parallel.      The more highly unstable the nervous
 system     is generally, the more         likely is     a woman when she becomes
 pregnant to sutler markedly, and for              a  lengthened time, from sickness,
 whether matutinal          simply or more            or less constant.         It is well,
however, to remember             that the inherent tone of the uterus                 itself
 will   affect   materially the molecular radiations engendered                     by the
 developing germinal mass, and                transmitted through the agency of
 the uterine tissue       to the nerve centre.            The resulting disturbances
 will  be correlatively augmented            or diminished        according as the tone
of the uterus is high or low.

researches    of Krukenberg,          Fredericq, Jousset de Bellesme,        Plateau,
Hoppe-Seyler,        as  well as those of the author, the problem now re
quiring solution is the following             : — Does  a true liver exist in the
Invertebrata     ?    The pancreas appears to be the chief digestive            organ
(other than a true stomach) of the earlier forms of animal life.
                           The Liver of Carcinus moenas.
   The   " liver   "
                      of Carcinus mamas consists of two large glands               on
each side      of   the   stomach,      and extends    the  whole length of the
cephalo-thorax.          These organs are of a yellow colour,         and consist of
numerous      ccecal tubes arranged          in tufts, which   are easily seen in a
dissection beneath the surface of water.                The secretion of the so-
called  "          "
           liver of Carcinus mcenas, when freshly killed, gives an
acid reaction.
   1.  The    secretion     of the organs forms an emulsion with stearin,
yielding subsequently fatty acids and glycerol              : —
                                            =
                C5tH„o06 + 3H20                3C18H3602 + C3H803.
   2. The      secretion acts upon 6tarch           paste.    The starch     granules
disappear,     with     the exception       of their celluloid covering; and on
treating with      water,     and   then    adding Folding's     solution, a deposit
of cuprous oxide was obtained.                  This reaction    shows    that there
exists in the secretion a substance capable of converting starch into
glucose.
   3. The secretion         dissolves    coagulated  albumin.
    4. Tannic acid gives a white precipitate with the secretion.
   5. The action of the secretion             upon milk was to render it trans
parent.
   6.  When       a few drops         of the secretion     of these     organs   were
examined with chemical reagents under the microscope,                     the follow
ing reactions were observed            : —
   On running in          a solution of iodine in potassium          iodide between
the slide and cover-slip,           a   brown    deposit was    obtained; and, on
running     in  concentrated        nitric acid upon another slide containing
the secretion, a yellowish           coloration was produced,       due to the for
mation of xanthoproteic acid.                These reactions    show the presence
of albumin in the secretion of the organs in question.

    The presence of albumins in the secretion            was also confirmed      by
the reactions recommended          by   Dr R. Palm (Zeitgchrift fiir Analy-
tische Chemie, vol. xxvL part i.).
    7.  The secretion    contains leucin and tyrosin, no doubt produced
by the metamorphoses        of certain albuminous substances.
    We know from Professor Foster's Physiology (4th                   ed. p. 438),
that "one result of the action of the pancreatic juice               is the forma
tion of considerable quantities of leucin and tyrosin."                Leucin and
tyrosin are
               " dehydrated in     a true   liver, forming a series of cyan-
hydrins or cyan-alcohols attached to a benzene nucleus, which then
pass into the circulation — (Latham).

sodium carbonate.        In the ash of a vertebrate liver the chief mineral
constituents are potassium and phosphoric acid.
    9.  The soluble zymase (ferment) secreted by the organ in ques
tion was extracted according to the Wittich-Kistiakowsky method
(Pfliiger's   Archie   fiir  Physiologie,     voL ix. pp.      438-459).       The
isolated    ferment     converts    fibrin     into    leucin   (a-amidocaproic
acid,   C6HI3N02)     and tyrosin      (paraoxyphenylamidopropionic           acid,
C9HnN03).
    10. No glycocholic and taurocholic            acids   could be detected     by
the Pettenkofer and other tests.
    11.  No glycogen     was found    in tho organ or its     secretion.
    12. The secretion has no action upon cellulose.
    13.  By using the methods      adopted by M. Zaleski (Zeitsch rift         fiir
Physiologische     Chemie,    vol. x. pp. 453-502) for ascertaining the
presence of ferrous, ferric, and ferrosoferric compounds in a true
liver, the author could not detect the presence of iron in the organ
or its secretion.
   From these reactions the conclusion to be drawn is, that the so-
called " liver of Carcinw moenas is pancreatic in function, i.e., its
                "
secretion is more like the secretion of the pancreas of the Vertebrata
than those of a true liver.
    Some biologists look upon the vertebrate liver,                pancreas,   and
 salivary glands as differentiated bodies of an original pancreas            of the

On the Air's Resistance to an Oscillating                              Body (its
      Influence on Time-Keepers).                         By Edward Sang, LL.D.
                                      (Read   April   15, 1889.)
      The influence of the air on             the going of time-keepers                    has naturally
been the subject of much discussion, particularly                                     in   reference    to
time-keepers used by astronomers.                       On pendulums the air acts in
two ways : — by its buoyancy it                     lessens     the downward tendency of
the parts, and      so    lengthens the time of the oscillation                   ;    and it opposes
resistance to the motion.                 On the chronometer balance, the latter
action alone is felt          ; to   this action we shall confine our remarks.
      The incitement          to motion is thus composed of two parts                         :   the one
due to the inclination of the curve or to the flexure of the balance
spring,    proportional          to the distance from the point of rest;                               the
other proportional to the square of the velocity                        ; so   that,        if x   repre
sent the distance             from the point of rest and v the velocity, the
differential     coefficient     of that velocity,            -g|
                                                                    or uv,   is   represented          by
an expression      of the general form

The resolution of this equation, which                        expresses      a    relation among
the function, its first and its second derivative, belongs to what                                     I
have called the Third co-ordinate branch of the Higher                                        Calculus,
or the Calculus of Primaries.                       Here we seek the relation of the
primary variable         t,   to some one of the three functions.
  The only useful application of this inquiry                           is   to the doctrine of

time-keeping, and we may, therefore,              first in   a general     way, consider
what may be the relative values of the coefficients                       P and Q, and
also the signs which these may take.
    In  my mean-time clock, the bob is a cylinder                      of lead cased in
brass,  having its diameter           3  inches,    its length 5, its weight, by
estimate,    being 101 200 grains          ;  and therefore for each             inch    of
deflection at the mean            distance the redressing tendency is 2586
grains.
    The air's resistance        on a square inch of surface in grains for                 a
velocity v measured         in inches per       second, varies, as deduced from
several formulas      in  use,' from .    *f   to            :   now the bob offers a
                                        1200         1600
                                                                            t2
surface    of 15 square inches, and thus we may assume                     —   iu grains
                                                                            ^
as the air's resistance      in our case.
    Now the oscillation extends             to 1-3 on each side, wherefore the
greatest    incitement amounts to            PX = 3362         grains;    the maximum
velocity     is  V=     1*3 x       4 "08   inches     per     second,    and   causes    a
maximum retardation of -166, or the sixth part of a grain at the
lowest point      ;  and thus it appears that the maximum resistance                    by
the air is only the twenty-thousandth part of the greatest redressing
tendency.
    Because     of the complexity of the parts, it is not so easy to form
 an estimate    in the    case of the chronometer balance.               In my two-day
 chronometer the compensating weights have a diameter of '3, or
just the tenth part of           the   pendulum bob        ;   and they oscillate to a
 distance,   measured      along the arc of 1-2 or 1*3, almost the same as
 that of the pendulum.            Hence,    if the times of oscillation had           been
 alike,   the ratio of disparity           would     have been 2000 instead of
 20000.       But the balance           makes    two complete oscillations              per
 second, while      the pendulum makes only one-half.                     Now, in order
 to quadruple        the number         of oscillations        per second,     we    must
 augment      P sixteen     times, Q being unchanged ; however, since the
 velocity is now quadrupled, the product QV2 is made sixteen times
 greater, and thus the ratio of PX to QV2 remains 2000 to 1.                           The
 rim of the balance meets with direct resistance only on its ends                     ;  its
 motion is impeded by what may be called friction, on the sides, and
 in all likelihood     the ratio of disparity is higher than for the weights;

  1888-89.]    DrSang on Air's Resistance             to Oscillating Bodies.            183
  we may, then, regard the ratio of 2000 to              1 as not too high.           Thus,
 in all    cases of any importance to us, we may regard                    Q as a very
 small fraction whose higher powers need not be taken into account ;
 it may     be more than enough for us to retain the second power.
     We     have   now to examine the signs of           P and Q      ; let us consider
 first that of P.
     When the oscillating body is moving from                A on    the side to which
 we have agreed to attach the sign             + x, towards the middle point O,
   -x   is decreasing     and its derivative v must take the sign              -   , at the
 same     time that velocity is increasing or becoming more                    -,    where
 fore uv is      -,   and so therefore      must be P.          When the body has
                                            *                             tlA
 passed O, x is increasing in the          - direction,    v therefore    is still    —
                                                                                        ;  it
 is, however, now decreasing, its derivative is therefore                + , so   that Fx
 must have the sign         + ,  but then x is     - , wherefore P       must be       -  in
 this quarter of the oscillation.            When the body has reached                   the
 extreme limit B and is returning          along  BO, its     - x is decreasing       more
 and more rapidly;        that is to say, both its velocity and the increment
of its velocity take the sign +        ,  Px  then is +    ,   but x is   - , wherefore
P   must    be-in      this third quarter also.        Lastly, when the body has
 passed O into the quarter OA, its + velocity is decreasing, and both
Yx and P         take   the sign   - .    Thus   it   seems that, in       all  the four
quarters of the oscillation,        P  must have the sign           -;   we shall then
write it    as   - a2.
    The air's    resistance,  denoted     by  Qy2,  tends     to lessen the velocity,
to hinder acceleration,          to help retardation          irrespective of signs.
When      the body is moving from         A towards O,       the   - velocity is being
increased in the       - direction by - a?x, and       this increase is opposed by
Qc2,    wherefore Q here takes           the sign    +, and       the total    influence
is  - a?x + Qb2.       In  the second      quarter, that is from O to B, the
 —   velocity is being lessened, and the air's resistance helps this, where
fore Qv2 takes here also the sign + . Again, in the third quarter,
from B towards 0, the + velocity is being augmented, and the
resistance    opposing this augmentation must take the sign                  -  .     Also,
in the fourth       quarter,   the + velocity is being retardod,          the retarda

tion is helped, and Qv2 takes the sign .  Thus we see that Q most -
have the sign + during the half oscillation from A to £, and the
opposite      sign    -   during the other half from B to A.                                   We shall there
fore      replace    Q of the            general formula              by +         /3,    observing that the
conclusions thence drawn only hold good from the limit                                                v   =   0   until
the next recurrence                of the     same condition               v   =   0.      This   is   one of the
many instances            in which generalisation by the accepted law of signs
is   inadmissible.
     Setting out from the equation
and taking           the differential              coefficient in regard                     to   the primary
variable      t,   we get

no resistance.               The diminution             of the space compensates for that of
the distance           ;    but this         compensation         is    not equally distributed.
Thus, in        the quarter of the time of an oscillation, the position                                         is
got by making at = 90°, which gives

     In    order to get the actual effect on the clock above mentioned,                                       we
observe that, since the half oscillation is performed in one second,

         M.B.
                                    (Read March 4, 1889.)
     One of the chief biliary pigments is bilirubin.                  It   has a red-orange
colour, and is derived from the decomposition of haemoglobin.                                 It
can be oxidised first into a green, then into a blue, then into a red,
and finally into a yellow-brown                pigment.        Between the blue and
red a violet substance              is produced, but     it is uncertain whether or
not this is only a mixture of the blue and red pigment.                          The forma
tion of the green pigment, according to Stadeler,* is due to oxidation,
together with the addition of a molecule of water.                         These pigments
do not always present exactly the same characters.                         Thus, according
to Dr MacMunn,              the green      pigment present in the ox-bile differs
from what is artificially produced from the oxidation of bilirubin,
say, from human bile, in that it is soluble in chloroform, t   This
pigment can, however, be oxidised up into the blue pigment, and so
on   ;   and    it belongs, therefore, to what         we may term the               bilirubin
series. Its colour indicates its position in the scale of oxidised
products.  We shall in this paper use the term biliverdin as desig
nating a green pigment, which is more oxidised than the bilirubin,
and bilicyanin          as designating a blue pigment             still      more oxidised.
The violet substance    such exist) we shall term the violet pig
                                (if
ment, the red oxidation product the red pigment, and, finally, the
yellow-brown           pigment, the most highly oxidised product of all,
choletelin.

the bilirubin series,          it   is   frequently, and we believe truly stated,
that no successful attempt has been made to reduce the higher back
again     to the lower ones.             By the reducing action              of, say, sodium
amalgam,        hydrobilirubin        (C32H40N4O7) has been produced both from

it changes to       green, and this finally to orange-brown.                          If    some of
the brown bile       be then treated          with    a few drops        of nitric acid, it           is
oxidised back into biliverdin,               and further additions of acid develop
the blue, violet, red, and yellow pigments.                            Here, then, without
going any further, we have an instance of the reduction of the pig
ment.          The reduction         does not produce            hydrobilirubin            alone,     as
that substance cannot be reoxidised in the way we have described.
   If   a bladder, fresh             from     the   slaughter-house, be opened,                     one
seldom or never fails to               see   signs of reduction within it.                    Blue or
blue-green bile fills the cavity, but thick orange-brown bile is seen
nert the       mucous       membrane,        which is itself brown in colour.                   It     is
not improbable, therefore, that during life, reduction of the biliverdin
takes place, due perhaps to the action of the mucous                                 membrane         of
the gall-bladder            or to the mucus          secreted     by it.       This     is,   indeed,
almost certainly the case, and one can recall the fact that the pigment
present in gall-stones from the ox consists, not of biliverdin,                                but of
bilirubin.
   It   was obviously         a     matter of some importance to investigate the
reduction        processes we have           just   described,    in order,      if    possible,      to
ascertain       their cause, and the influence of modifying                             conditions
upon them.          We       have been greatly assisted          in this inquiry by Dr
 MacMunn.          We sent to him on several              occasions solutions in which
 we had difficulty           in determining whether definite absorption-bands
 were present, and we have very warmly to thank him for the courtesy
 with which he was ever willing to help us.
   Experiment       I.   — Temperature of             the laboratory,          60°.     Two         test-
 tubes were filled with fresh green ox-bile, and watched from day to
 day.    After     three days the bile in the lower part of one of the tubes
 had become of          a   brown-green colour.           The change in colour spread
 upwards, and in twelve hours the whole tube contained bile of                                         a
 uniform brown              tint.     Putrefaction,      indicated            by an    unpleasant
 odour, had set in by this time.                      In the other            tube    the bile did
 not change in colour, nor was there any sign of putrefaction until
 the   following     day, when both appeared                simultaneously.                 Later on
 the    bile    became      by degrees of       a   light amber colour, giving, how
 ever, the play of colours for nearly four months, after which Gmelin's
 test failed. The fluid was then examined with the spectroscope.
 There was slight shading at the violet end of the spectrum, and the

 190             Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                    [sess.
 bands of cholohsematin           *   were    present.       There    was   no    distinct
hydrobilirubin       band.      It  is seen, therefore, that on exposure to the
atmosphere       the biliverdin      is reduced   ; the   bilirubin disappears with
out forming hydrobilirubin.
     Experiment     II. — Test-tubes       wore    filled with ox-bile, and pieces
of the mucous          membrane        of the gall-bladder        were    added.      The
changes observed          were similar      to those    detailed in Experiment           I.
The mucous         membrane      seemed to hasten         the reduction of the        bile
in its neighbourhood.               The    reduction      of   the    pigment seemed
remarkably to coincide in point of time with the establishment                          of
putrefaction.        The following        experiments were conducted in order
to eliminate putrefactive changes from the other conditions present.
     Experiment      III. — Ox-bile       was   boiled     in  test-tubes   which     hail
previously been plugged with wool.                    No alteration in colour was
produced by boiling, nor did any take place for seven days.                             It
then became of a light brown colour, rapidly fading, until after a
fortnight     it  was nearly colourless.          Gmelin's test failed after three
weeks, and       two weeks      afterwards the fluid was examined with the
spectroscope.         Cholohaimatin        bands were absent; there            was   pos
sibly a trace of hydrobilirubin.                 This experiment indicates that
reduction of the biliverdin takes             place, and the bilirubin disappears
in bile which has been prevented from putrefying.                        The reduction
of the biliverdin      seems to be hastened          by putrefaction.
     Experiment.    IV. — Ox-bile       was evaporated        to dryness at 50°.        It
very slowly changed its colour, and only failed to give Gmelin's test
after several months' exposure.
     Experiment      V. — Some      exhausted and sterilised glass tubes were
drawn out into capillary points.                The points were thrust through
the wall of a fresh gall-bladder, and broken off by the fingers which
grasped them from without the bladder.                    They instantly filled with
bile, and after their withdrawal            from the bladder their ends were at
once sealed       up in the blow-ilame.           No    change    of colour occurred
for fourteen days       ;  the weather was        cold and dull.         By that time,
however,      they had become           brown    in colour.       No further      change
occurred,    and after a year they gave a distinct              play of colours with
nitric acid.

    Changes, not very dissimilar in their nature, occur when blood is
received directly into a sterilised tube from an artery.                In this  case
the oxyhemoglobin          is reduced, and remains for years without under
going further change.            In   the sterilised tubes filled    with bile the
change     in colour    seemed to be influenced         in the thick mucus of the
bladder, for those that contained most                  mucus invariably     became
brown before those that contained             less mucus.
    It will be     seen, however, by the results of the next two experi
ments,    that reduction occurs quite readily in the absence of bladder
mucus.       The two experiments            were   unfortunately   performed, the
first in dull cold weather, and the second in warm bright weather,
 so that they cannot be very            rigidly  compared.      One can conclude,
however, from the general results obtained, that thick bladder mucus
assists the reduction, although its presence is not essential.
    Experiment       VI. — Exhausted       and sterilised tubes were filled with
bile drawn directly from the hepatic duct of                  a freshly  killed   ox.
Reduction took        place  in  three days.
   Experiment        VII. — In    order to ascertain whether reduction would
take place in bile absolutely free from mucus, this substance was
precipitated by means of alcohol. The filtrate subsequent to the
separation of the mucus was evaporated                over a water-bath   until the
alcohol was expelled.           The reduction took place, however, in two
days   ; the weather was hot and bright.
    The last experiments were made during hot midsummer weather,
nnd it was noticed that, while in all cases reduction took place with
rapidity, this was especially the case in the tubes most exposed to
light.     In  the following      experiments the action of light was more
fully investigated.
    Experiment      VIII — (a)      Bile within    test-tubes exposed to light was
          reduced in twenty-four           hours, and after a week failed to
          give Gmelin's test      ;  weather hot and bright         Other portions
          of the same bile in a dark metal chamber were reduced in
          three days.
   (b) Bile boiled in plugged tubes and exposed to light was reduced
          in twenty-eight hours. A portion treated in a similar way,
         but    placed   within the dark chamber, still preserved            a trace
          of the original green colour for seventeen days.
   (?) Bile within the exhausted and sterilised tubes was reduced

            by the light in twenty hours.                         In the dark chamber they
            began slowly to undergo change                        at the bottom of the tube
            after twenty-four hours.
     (d)   A    film of bile about          1   millimetre thick was dried at a low tem
            perature.          On the fourth day it had completely                      changed     its
            colour to brown           ;   while, on the other hand,            a   film, similarly
            prepared,         but kept in the dark, remained blue-green,                           the
            original colour of the bile, for a                    year and a-half — the time
            when it was finally examined.
     It    would      seem,     therefore,        that biliverdin readily parts with its
oxygen like oxyhemoglobin.                         It   is reduced in the sterilised tubes
to   bilirubin, but           no further.         This reduction is        hastened        by light,
and putrefaction, and the presence of thick                           mucus.       It   is only pre
vented by drying the bile and keeping it in a dark chamber.
     When bile           putrefies,   or when, without              putrefaction, the bile has
been       altered by boiling             it,   the bilirubin finally disappears,            and    no
play of colour           is   obtained by the application of Gmelin's test
     This      residue     contained        a    brown pigment          giving no absorption
bands, and differing from                  hydrobilirubin in its solubilities.               It    was
insoluble in ether, but readily soluble in alcohol.

     Bilirubin, when            exposed         to the air, under ordinary circumstances,
never       becomes        converted into biliverdin.                 This takes        place,    how
ever,     if   the solution has previously been rendered strongly alkaline
by the addition of caustic soda solution.                           Both nascent oxygen and
ozone, we find, are capable of effecting this change in bile of normal
reaction.         To     do this experiment, pieces of blotting-paper soaked                         in
bile should be exposed to the vapour of ozone                         ;   ozonic ether, liberat
ing nascent           oxygen, can also oxidise these papers.                       If   human bile
is   poured into          a   small beaker, and           a   stream      of electricity passed
through         it,   obtained from some five or six Grove cells — the ter
minals should              be of      platinum      — the oxygen given off from the
positive terminal, in the course of three or four minutes, changes
the bile in its vacinity, first to                  a   green, and finally to       a    blue-green

 colour.      The experiment may be performed in, perhaps,             a more satis
 factory manner by dipping a piece of blotting-paper in the Lile, and
 laying it directly on the terminals.           The bruwn colour ci: -r.ges near
 the  positive terminal, first to green, then to blue, and finally to vii'.-rt.
At this      stag?, however, much of the pigment becomes Lleu-he-h so
that the violet is nut so distinct as either the blue or the _r--ta.
    The lower oxidation products of bilirubin can be reduced >jt:S-
cially.      If some bile be acidulated with impure nitric acid, so is to
oxidise     its bilirubin to biliverdin or bilicyanin,           and    if piecjs of
blotting-paper be then dipped in these, the vapour of ammonium
sulphide       can reduce     them.     The blue colour is redti'-ed through
green to brown, and         it can then be oxidised by nitric acid.            If bl   •:-
ting-paper      is soaked    in bile and reoxidised by      the positive pole of
the battery, the pigment is again reduced               on reversing the         p^-les.
The brown can be oxidised to green and then to blue, and afterwai Is
reduced to brown, passing through               green.   If  oxidised to red, re
ducing reagents        then change the colour to a yellow-brown, but n:-t
through any intermediate stages.                 Oxidising   agents      restore    the
original red colour.
    It   is much     easier to perform these experiments           with bile      than
with pure bilirubin.           Bilirubin dissolved in    caustic   fo'a    i= difficult

the two reactions are complementary to each other.              Among the series
to which he extended his investigations was that of benzyl, and                  in
a paper published       in the Berichte of the Berlin Chemical Society*
he describes    the   preparation of mono- and dibenzyl-phosphine, and
gives their properties.        Dibenzyl-phosphine      he isolated as a crystal
line substance      perfectly tasteless   and odourless,      insoluble in ether,
but soluble in alcohol.        Its melting-point     he found to be 205° C.
    In a paper   read before this Society (19th December 1887), one              of
us,  in conjunction with Mr W. Wheeler,            describes further investiga
tions on this body, and shows that          it forms    a series   of compounds
of a somewhat remarkable nature for a            secondary phosphine.         This
fact, and some other properties of the substance, led to the suspicion
that it was not dibenzyl-phosphine at all, but the oxide of tribenzyl-
phosphine.      Accordingly the investigation was re-opened with               Mr
E. F. Blake, and its      course has been as follows       : —
    1. On carefully re-crystallising       the substance       from alcohol, its
corrected melting-point was found to be 216-216-5°                 C,  while that
of two specimens of oxide of tribenzyl.phosphine               (prepared  by two
different methods) was found to be the same.
   2. Very little difference exists in the percentage amount of carbon
and hydrogen in dibenzyl-phosphine             and oxide of tribenzyl-phos-
phine, as the following numbers show           : —
                             (CTH7)aHP              (CrH7)sPO

            Hydrogen           =   7*01                  6-56
Consequently       it would not      be possible to decide        with absolute
precision between the two substances by a mere combustion.                     On
the other hand, there is a considerable difference             between   the two
bodies in their percentage of phosphorus           :—

           Phosphorus           =14-48                  969
Unfortunately,      however, as we have again and again found, the pro
cesses  for phosphorus determinations in ordinary organic substances
are absolutely untrustworthy          when applied to phosphines.          A  new

    4. Action    of fusel Potash     on Hofmann's "Dibenzyl-Phosphine."                —
 In the   paper    by one of us and W. "Wheeler                  already alluded to,
the statement is made that when Hofmann's                      dibenzyl-phosphine is
heated with caustic, potash,            or soda,      " it   fuses   and    floats on the
surface of the melted alkali.          No violent action          occurs, but on cool
ing the mixture       and treating    it with water         the greater       portion dis
 solves, and acids      then precipitate a flocky crystalline                  substance,
 which is dibenzyl-pho8phinic              acid."       In corroboration of this
statement, the melting-point of the acid and analyses of its lead and
barium salts were given, all in accordance with the required numbers.
After we had satisfied       ourselves    that Hofmann's dibenzyl-phosphine
was oxide of tribenzyl-phosphine, and                  nothing else, this reaction
recurred to our minds        as a  further and very striking excuse for the
mistake we (and Hofmann) had fallen into, and we thought it of
importance to verify the previous observation.                          This we have
accordingly done, both with Hofmann's dibenzyl-phosphine and with
a specimen     of oxide of tribenzyl-phosphine              prepared      by a different

method.      The phenomena observed were exactly the same as those
previously    described,        and the melting-point               of the acid obtained
after precipitation with hydrochloric acid and two recrystallisations
from alcohol was found to be 192° C, which is the melting-point of
pure dibenzyl-phosphinic                 acid.         Our previous observation is thus
fully   confirmed.       The reaction in all probability occurs as follows: —
               (C7H7)3PO +              KHO = C7H8 + (C7H7)2KPOj.
The occurrence         of oxide of tribenzyl-phosphine                     among the pro
ducts of Hofmann's              sealed       tube reaction led us to suspect              that
tribenzyl-phosphine           had been formed in the first instance, but was
subsequently oxidised by atmospheric oxygen.                         It   became necessary,
therefore,   to search for the tertiary phosphine                 in the original product.
The investigation was attended with considerable difficulties, as we
had already proved that the products of the sealed tube reaction
are a   highly complex mixture, and contain,                     among other substances,
resinous bodies which are exceedingly difficult                         to get rid of.     "We
succeeded at last       in isolating          a   liquid which grows hot on exposure
to air, with production both of oxide of tribenzyl-phosphine,                              and
of dibenzyl-phosphinic             acid; which              is precipitated     by hydriodk
acid, forming solid compounds                     ;   and which in contact with sulphur
gives rise    to a crystalline               compound, which we believe to be tri-
bonzyl-phosphine sulphide.                    Moreover, the liquid acts energetically
upon crystallised iodide of benzyl to give iodide of tetrabenzyl-
phosphonium.           The liquid appears, in fact, to be a mixture of the
secondary and tertiary phosphines.                         Continuing     our investigations,
we have succeeded             in obtaining from the liquid two solid              substances
which     are easily separated                from each other.          The first is almost
insoluble     in     ether,     and has               either the formula      (C-H^jPOj or
(C7H7)3PS.*     The second is undoubtedly tribenzyl-phosphine
itself. It crystallises easily from alcohol, and unites with sulphur
at ordinary temperature and with oxygen also.                              We    have    not as
yet obtained it in sufficient quantity to thoroughly investigate its
properties.
   * We
         give this last formula partly because the first is improbable, and partly
because the substance in question has the same melting-point and properties
as the sulphide of tribenzyl-phosphine.     But, on the other hand, we have not
as yet detected sulphur in        it,
                                and unless that element was present in the crude
products used, its occurrence           is
                                  incomprehensible.

     We have, we consider, all the necessary evidence to show                     that
in Hofmann's sealed tube reaction phosphuretted hydrogen                           acts
upon chloride of benzyl as ammonia does on an alkyl iodide                      ; that
is to say, that all of the following reactions occur : —

               (1)     C7H7a     +  PH3     (C7H?)PH2.HCl

With     regard to the reaction (4) we are disposed to think that the
oxide of tribenzyl-pho8phine found by Hofmann, and mistaken by
him for dibenzyl-phosphine (and by             ourselves as well), owes its origin
 to the action of the potash on tetrabenzyl-phosphonium cldoride or
 iodide, an action which N. Collie and one of us has already proved
 to occur easily in     the following    manner    : —
              (C7H7)4PC1     +  KHO = (C7H7)3PO          + KC1 +    C7Ha
     We may     here mention that we have            also isolated from the pro
  ducts of Hofmann's reaction all the possible oxidised derivative
 •which the whole series of benzyl-phosphines can give rise to, viz.: —
                                    — Benzyl phosphinous         acid.
                   (C7H7)H2POs
                                    — Benzyl phosphinic        acid.
                   (C7H7)H2P03
                                    — Dibenzyl-phosphinic acid.
                   (C7H7)2HP02
                   (C7H7)3PO.
                                 — Tribenzyl-phosphine oxide.
     5. We have also investigated the action of monobenzyl-phosphino
  on iodide of benzyl, with the view to obtaining                    pure dibenzyl-
  phosphine.
     The reaction     occurs   readily at ordinary temperatures,          though no
  sensible heat     is evolved, and a solid crystalline            product results.
  Although   some of this was found          to contain the correct percentage
  of iodine for the formula (C7H7)2HP.HI, it is either                 a mixture     of
  three   substances     at   least, — viz., dibenzyl-phosphine          hydriodate,
  tribenzyl - phosphine       hydriodate,     and     tetrabenzyl    - phosphonium
  iodide, — or readily   decomposes     and give rise to them.         On decompos
  ing it with potash     a colourless liquid results, together with         a solid —
  the latter being undoubtedly          oxide    of tribenzyl-phosphine.          The
  liquid when    exposed     to the air oxidises readily, and yields both
  dibenzyl - phosphinic       acid    and    oxide     of   tribenzyl-phosphine.

When it        is distilled     under diminished            pressure         with    great    care,       a
liquid passes over which contains the primary phosphine, as                                       well
as   some       of the secondary             body, and possibly               a   little tribenzyl-
phosphine also.
     Our investigations on this very interesting and apparently extra
ordinary reaction           are proceeding           — the chief difficulty which we
have      to contend        with being            to obtain      sufficient of the primary
phosphine in a pure condition for the experiment.
     So far the results of our investigations show that —
     1. Ilofmann's
                     " dibenzyl-phosphine " is undoubtedly                              the      oxiile
of tribenzyl-phosphino.
     2.   Dibenzyl-phosphine            is       probably    a   liquid combining                easily
with      hydracids       to    give solid          products      of    normal       composition          ;
oxidising in contact with air to form dibenzyl-phosphinic                                acid.
     3.   Tribenzyl-phosphino           is   a    solid crystalline substance combining
with hydracids, and              both with           sulphur      and       oxygen at ordinary
temperatures        to form solid products.
     4.   In   llol'maun's sealed tube reaction (i.e., action of phosphuretted
hydrogen on benzyl chloride) all the phosphines (as well as the
quaternary compound) are obtained, and also all their possible
products of oxidation (some of the latter may possibly not pre-exist
in the crude product of the reaction, but be formed by subsequent
treatment).          Iu addition, other               substances            are   obtained.        The
reaction is in fact highly complex, and                           is,   we venture to            think,
extremely interesting,                             certainly different from all similar
                                        it
                                   as   is
reactions       observed       by Hofmann with fatty derivatives.
     5.   Monobenzyl-phosphine                is   acted upon by crystallised iodide                  of
benzyl at ordinary temperatures,                      and     probably gives           rise   to free
hydriodic         acid,     and to      the secondary,            tertiary,       and quaternary
compounds.           If this     be the ease, the action               is   also comparable        with
that which occurs between ammonia and an alkyl iodide.
     Our       researches      on the        above    subjects have involved                  a   large
expenditure of time,              energy, and         material, and have been tedious
and troublesome in the extreme.                      Wc     have, however,          the satisfaction
of believing that the work, which has extended over several years,                                    is
 nearly at an end, and we trust in                   a   few months to be able to give                a
detailed account of the whole of our experiments to the Society.

Differentiation of any (Scalar) Power of a Quaternion.
     By Alexander     M'Aulay, Ormond College, Melbourne.
     Communicated by Professor Tait.
                                       (Read February 18, 1889.)
     Nowhere,         I    think,     does     Hamilton,              or any other author, attempt
the very fundamental problem of finding the differential of q" where
q is a quaternion and n any scalar.                              It   was by noticing an oversight
in Tait's Quaternions,      § 182, where he considers d.qi, that                                    I was   led
to   a    consideration of the subject
                                                                                             ....
     In that section Tait              says that the equation
                                      dq.r-rdq = dr.q-qdr                       .                           (1),
where                                        r = £3                                                         (''),
is sufficient to determine dq as a function of dr, but this will be
found not to               Equation (1) will be found to bo equiva
                          be the case.
lent to but two equations among scalars, whereas the equation from
which it is derived, viz.,
                                    q2dq +     qdq.q + dq.q2 = dr                                           (3),
is equivalent to four               such equations.                   Equation (1) may be written
                                       VYrVdq            =   WqVdr,
and thus it only gives the component of Ydrj,                                       viz.,     V^r.VVrVr/y,
perpendicular              to the axis of r.             There are thus two scalars involved
in   dq (viz., Sdq anil the resolved                          part of Vdq parallel to the axis
of       r),   which, so far as equation (1)                     is    concerned,           are left perfectly
arbitrary.
     In        fact, a,    b   being given          quaternions and                 q   a   sought one, the
equation
                                               aq    - qa =      b,
in which the conditions
                                            Sft =   0,       Sai = 0,
must be satisfied, gives as solution
                                       2    = a;+    l(y     +   b)Y-la,
where           x and     y    are arbitrary scalars.                  If   we use the method               and
result Tait suggests,             we are led to dq =                  oo   .*

     Before considering the problem in hand — that of finding                                                     d.q'

quaternion function            of any quaternion.                    The form of the function
depends    on q and n, and we shall denote                          it by    a' (q,             Suppose o            is

planar with q, and a"           a       vector perpendicular to the axis of                          q.          There
are several useful forms of               a'    and a".         Notice that we have
                 a!   = Sa     +    component of           Va parallel to Vq                .

This gives
                               a'   +   a" = a                                                                     (4),
                           a' =Sa   +    V2S.V-V                                                                   (5),

These are some of the simple forms of                                a'   and a", and we shall
employ more than one of them.
     The quaternion function                  (q,   n)
                                                     is   defined by the equation

We will give          some of the simpler forms of                          (q,   it)      in full, though
equation (8)          is   what we shall use                   in   the   present           investigation.
Putting    a'   =a     - a",   and substituting for a" the last value in equa
tion (7), we get
             (q,n)a        = nq*-*a                                                                                (9).

Again, substituting the first value in equation (6),

     Another important modification                       is   obtained from the fact that                          if

                                         (Read February 18, 1889.)
     There        is,     undoubtedly, an omission in                 §   182 of my Quaternions
(2nd       ed.), but        it   is   by no means so serious as                  Mr M'Aulay                       asserts.
In   fact the solution there given                  is     merely an unfinished one, not in
any       sense erroneous.             I    sketch briefly the completion of                              it,     as pre

     The equation

but this         does not make dq infinite.                  In   fact    it    gives

Now       it    is   easy to see that

x and y being undetermined scalars.
   Substitute in (1), and again use (3), and we have

The fact that this equation              is   of the second, instead of the fourth
degree,    is   of course due to the very special form of                        <j>   as   shown in     (1

plane of   q ;    while the second kills           a   vector parallel to the axis of q.

     In  Reiss we have an author who starts to his subject                    as if it
 were entirely new,        the only preceding mathematician whom he
 mentions being Lagrange.            Like Cauchy          he opens    by explaining
 a mode of forming functions more general                  than those of which he
 afterwards treats, the essence of         it being that       an expression  involv

His rule of formation of the           terms     and rule of signs are combined
after the manner of Hindenburg.                   Like Hindenburg, he arranges
the permutations as one arranges              numbers in increasing order of
magnitude;      but, unlike      Hindenburg,         after the    arrangement    has

remainder 5, and thence                         conclude that the sign wanted is got from
the sign of the                5thby multiplying the latter by ( l)s.

course 5           has then to be  dealt with after the manner  of 23, the
quotient and remainder this time being                                       2     and 1, so that we conclude
that the sign of the                     5th   term is got from the sign of the 1" term
by    multiplying                  by     (-1)2.               And         the         sign           of     the         1"     term
being +        ,   the sign of the 23rt is thus seen to be

It   would seem at first                       as    if    the case where M is itself                                a   factorial
were neglected.                    This however, is not                      so, the condition m                          <     1    +
1.2.3     I being corrective of the opening statement that M must
         . . .
lie between 1.2.3...J and 1.2.3 ... I (1 +        For example, the                         1).
term being the                     24'\ we put                 24    in the form                 3     x 1.2.3 +              6,    and
thus learn that the sign required                                   is     different from the sign of the
6th term       :     then we put               6     in the form             2     x 1.2         +     2,    and thus learn
that the sign of the                    6th   term        is   the same as the sign of the                               2** term     ;
finally, we put                2   in the form                 lxl +       1,    which shows that the sign
of the 2°* term differs from the sign of the 1"                                                  :     the conclusion of
the whole being that the signs of the                                              24th        and 1" terms are the
same, or that they are connected                                 by the factor (-l)3+2+1.

of signs for the purposes                            of demonstration                      it     is       scarcely       possible
to conceive,              and, as might therefore be expected,                                        it     is   on the score

     The remaining               six or seven pages of the paper are more interest
ing,      and concern the subject of vanishing                                     aggregates         of products
of pairs          of determinants.                  The theorems were suggested by taking,
as    we now say, a determinant                         of even order having its last                       n   rows'
identical           with its first n         rows, e.g., the determinant
                                                    (o6o6,1234),
and       using theorem (3) to expand it in terms of minors formed from
the       first n rows and their complementary minors. When n is even,
a    proof       is thus obtained,                  as we have           seen in the footnote to the
account of Bezout's paper                       of     1779, that the first                half of the      expan
sion       is equal to zero.                "When n is odd, the method fails, although

that although general                 determinants           in Laplace's notation occur
(p. 351,    &c), the real interest of the papers arises from the fact
that use is mado in them of that special form which afterwards
came to be associated with Jacohi's                     name.          His introductory words

     Unlike Jacobi,           Minding        was     unaware,          apparently, of the ex
 istence of a theory of determinants.                         The functions occur at every
 step of his investigation,                 yet he makes no use of their known
 properties    to obtain Ids results.
     lie   deals    with four problems in his                        memoir,       the   second    two
 being the     analogues, in space, of the first                    two.    Nothing noteworthy

identity,
       Pi ~fy' = a{b'e"-b"ef)            +    a'(b"c-bc")           +    a"(M-b'c),

This identity, it may      be remembered,        we have noted under Lagrange
as an elementary case of the theorem              afterwards well known regard
ing  a  minor of   the adjugate determinant.               Strange to say, it makes
only its second      appearance    here fifty-six       years      afterwards.       In   the
interim, too, no other special           case of the theorem seems to have
been established
   The third is that if P,       F,  F",   F",    be four points          in  space, given

1888-89.]      Dr T. Muir            on the Theory            of Determinants.                       221
occurs in connection with the subject of determinants, — a fact most
significant of the comparative neglect of mathematical studies in
Britain during the 18th century. Apart from the contents, there
fore,    some   little interest            attaches     to Drinkwater's            short paper,           as
being the first sign to us of that revival which,                               as is well known
otherwise, had taken place some few years before.
   Drinkwater knew of the investigations of Cramer, Bezout, and
Laplace; and         professed          only to put the elements                     of the subject
" in   a more convenient form."                    His rule of signs is           stated and illus
trated    as follows (p.        25) :
                                         —
           " Write down            the series       of natural numbers              1 2   3  4.   .   .    n,
       and underneath it all the permutations of these n numbers,
       prefixing to each a positive or negative sign according to the
       following condition              : —
           " Any                                     be derived from the first by con
                     permutation may
       sidering a requisite number of figures                             to move       from left to
       right by a certain number of single steps or descents                                        of      a
       single place.           If   the whole number of such single steps neces
       sary to derive any permutation from the first be even, that
       permutation has a positive sign prefixed to it                              ;   the others       are
       negative.        For instance,            4 2    13.     .   . n may be derived from
        1  2 3  4.    .  .   .  n, by first causing the 3 to descend below the 4,
       requiring one single step                :  then the        2   below the new place of
       the 4, another single step                  ;  lastly, the       1   below the new place
       of the     2, requiring            two more       steps, making          in all     4.    There
        fore this permutation requires the positive sign."
 In   this there is essentially nothing                         new    :   it  at    once     recalls       a
 theorem of Rothe's (m. 8).                     In the following paragraph, however,
 we find the discussion of a point not previously dealt with.                                         The
 words are (p. 25)         : —
            " The  same permutation may be derived                           in various     ways, and
        it is  necessary,       therefore,        to show that this rule is not incon
        sistent with itself           :    thus the same permutation                   4 2   13.    .    .  n

        making six in all, an even number as before.                               Without      accum

   In his    preface      Mainardi explains that the algebraical functions
referred to in the title are "funzioni risultanti o determinanii."
But although         he thus speaks        of them as        if they  were known    to
mathematicians by name, and mentions the researches                         of Monge,
Lagrange, Cauchy, and Binet in regard                   to them, he does not take
for granted that his          reader     has a knowledge of any of their pro
perties.     The one theorem on determinants, — the multiplication-
theorem,    —  which forms the basis of the whole memoir, is con
sequently sought to be established without the use of any previously
proved theorem.           The attempt,       as might be expected, is interesting.
    The first two sections          (pp. 9-29) of the three into which the
memoir is divided           may be passed over without much comment.
The first    deals   with the multiplication-theorem for two determinants
of i the 2nd order, and with those applications of it to geometry
which arise on making the elements of each determinant the
Cartesian co-ordinates         of two points in a plane.            No proof is   con
sidered necessary for this simple case, the opening paragraph of the
memoir being        ;—

There    has been no previous instance of an identity perfectly similar
to this  ;   the nearest approach to such being, as the numbering shows,                        a
result obtained by Binet in             1811.      The exact character of the affin
ity between the two, and           the general theorem which both foreshadow,
will  be most readily brought into evidence by a                  little additional trans
formation.        Taking first the right-hand            side    of the identity,       we ob
serve that the three determinants have only twelve elements                             among
them, being obtainable in fact from a single array of four rows and
three columns.          Their  sum may consequently be put                 in the form
                             1

   The constitution of the 3rd section is quite like that of the
others, the first paragraph dealing with the multiplication-theorem
for the  case of determinants of the 3rd order, the second            paragraph
with the   same theorem    for determinants of the 4th order, and the
remaining    eight  paragraphs with geometrical applications.               The
mode of proof of the     multiplication-theorem         is partly indicated by
saying that any particular case is made dependent on the case imme
diately preceding it  ; hut its exact character can only be understood
by a somewhat minute examination.              The investigation for the   case
of determinants of   the 3rd order stands as follows (p. 29)         :—

            The first two of these memoirs may be viewed as continuations of                                                             a
         memoir with                a     similar title, which appeared in the second volume of
          Crelle's        Journal, and              to which we have already referred.                                        They      are
         noted here merely in order that the thread of investigation may be
          preserved            unbroken, for the last memoir practically swallows up, by
          means of its splendid generalisations, all those that had gone before.
             So long as we confine ourselves, in problems of transformation, to
          three independent variables, the explicit employment of the theory of
          determinants may be dispensed with.                                          When, however,                     a   sufficient
          number of special cases have                                been        investigated, and an alluring
          glimpse has thereby been got of                             a   generalisation involving them all,
          he who attempts the establishment of the generalisation must have
          recourse            to the new weapon.                        In    this latter position Jacobi now
          found himself.                       He wished         to pass from the problem of orthogonal
          substitution in the case of three variables to the analogous                                                         problem
          in which the number of variables                               is   n, or in his own words (p.                           7):  —

This being the          case   he introduces        determinants       at    the outset,
fixing upon a notation which               is practically      Cauchy's, and imme
diately using properties of them without                    proof.     Much        that    is
contained in the memoir falls to be considered later, as it concerns
special forms of determinants, — those afterwards known                    as  Jacobians,
axisymmetric         determinants,       and,    of course,      determinants        of an
orthogonal substitution.            Indeed, the half-page of introduction                  is
almost all that is of interest at present, but even in this a new and
important theorem is enunciated.                 The first   sentence   of it    stands as
follows: —

As for        the first theorem                    thus formulated, the credit of                                        it   is,   of
course, due to Cauchy                   :        the second, however,                             is    new, being indeed
the theorem referred to above under Minding as having been fore
shadowed by Lagrange, and left for over fifty years                                                                 undisturbed.
Jacobi evidently knew                    it      in all its generality, for                            he adds       —

determinants are certain to occur explicitly or implicitly              ; and, the
author being Jacobi, one is not surprised to find them introduced
near the outset and employed thenceforward.                 It is of course only
a special form of them which appears, viz., that afterwards distin
guished by the term persymmetric;              consequently, for the present
the main contents of the memoir do not concern us.                Note has to be
made, however, of two points — (1) that while           Jacobi   does not discard
bis former notation 2 ± a.     ,, ar ,,  . . . a, ,,  , he introduces and uses
another, viz.,
(2) that a page is devoted to a fuller statement of the above-

The        Electrotonic Variation with Strong Polarising

                                             (Read January 21, 1889.)
     Let AB         (fig.       1)   be    a    piece     of nerve interposed in the galvano
meter circuit, and                   C   D in the battery circuit                        Then, as has long
been known, on closing the battery circuit, one obtains                                            a    current    in
the galvanometer circuit, the direction of which in the nerve                                               is    the
same as that                of the polarising                  current.       If, now, stimulation be
made,        say       at   I,        this      current         undergoes         a     negative variation.
Hermann,            who investigated the subject, after Bernstein,                                         was at
first inclined              to explain             the negative variation                      by his      law of
"polarisation increment."                           He         assumed        that           the excitation        in
passing along               a   polarised nerve undergoes               in its intensity,

increasing as           it       passes       through regions under the influence of the
anode,        decreasing              as   it   passes         through     parts         dominated by the
cathode.

     Now,         if   the current be ascending                           in the nerve             (fig.   1),    the
electrotonic current in                       AB   is     also ascending.                As    B   is   nearer the
cathode than                A,   the excitation will pass                 B   in   less intensity than            A
Accordingly, during tetanus,                            B   may be considered as less negative
than A.             In other          words,     B      will    be positive to          A, and     a    current    of

action       will   pass through the galvanometer from                        B   to   A.*        This will
have     the opposite direction to the electrotonic current, and                                       will
therefore look like a diminution or negative variation of that current.
Similarly,          if C    he the anode,          and the current be descending, the
excitation will pass over                   B in greater intensity than                    over    A, and
again there          will   be a negative variation              of the electrotonic current.
Hermann,            as already stated,            seemed    at    one time to suppose                  that
this was a complete explanation of the phenomena.                                           But     he was
afterwards led by rheotonie researches                            to  modify his view, and,

factor in the explanation,                   to postulate besides,                as Bernstein         had
previously done in a somewhat different form, an actual diminution
in the polarisation,           a negative variation, so to say,                     in   the capability
of the nerve to take on                      polarisation        between core and sheath.

   According to Hermann, the electrotonic currents are branches                                          of
the polarising             stream   which         spread   beyond the electrodes,                   owing
to the transverse resistance                      caused   by polarisation                 between     this
hypothetical          core and sheath.              The greater          the polarisation coeffi
cient    is,   the more widely do these branches spread, the stronger are
the electrotonic currents.                   If   stimulation          diminishes this polarisa
tion coefficient       it    will, in   general, diminish           the electrotonic currents.
If the excitation           be confined to special parts of the nerve, then                             it
will depend upon the ratio of the transition                            resistance         between    core
and sheath to the longitudinal resistance of the nerve, and upon the
magnitude and position                  of     the unexcited or relatively                    unexcittd
parts, whether the electrotonic variation (as we may for shortness
call the variation of the electrotonic currents produced by stimula
tion)    will       be negative or positive.               All    this he deduces from his
theory, and supports by experiments with the
                                                                          " Kcrnluiter Modell."
He looked, in vain, however, for                     a   positive phase in his rheotome
work on nerve, the experimental difficulties being very great.
   It   was not from Hermann's                    theoretical standpoint that                I     entered

upon the work of which this paper is an account.                                  But from certain
experiments on the effect of stimulation                           on the intrapolar current
during the flow, and on hoth extra and intrapolar                                      currents after
the opening of the polarising stream,                       I   suspected      that,   if   one of the
galvanometer electrodes                  were          placed    very      near    the       polarising
circuit, and the strength of the current increased                                     sufficiently,       a
positive electrotonic variation                       ought to appear          on the side of the
anode, hut not on that of the cathode.                          For the explanation of              those
experiments it was assumed, and the assumption was supported by
direct experiments on muscular contraction, that during the flow
of the polarising              current the conductivity                 of the nerve for the
excitatory change is less around the cathode than around the anode,
and that, with increasing strength of current, complete block occurs
sooner     at    the former than at the latter, although                               eventually          it
prevails at both.               Whether,           when this last stage is reached,                      the
whole intrapolar area has lost its conductivity,                                was    left    an open
question, and need not be considered here.
     Going back now to fig.              1,    let us inquire what the effect would be
on the sido of the anode,                     i.e.,    with descending current, at                a time
when complete block was established there, and at the same time
let us suppose that the galvanometer circuit is brought quite close
to the anode, so that the lower galvanometer electrode is                                   within the
non-conducting           region.         If     stimulation       be       now made         at    I,    the
excitation       will   pass    A with         a      certain intensity, but       will altogether
fail   before    reaching B.             B will, therefore,            be strongly positive               to
A.     We    leave out of account for the moment any possible effect                                      of
the excitation on the electrotonic currents as such.                                   There     will     be
a   current of action developed in the descending direction through
the nervo       — that    is,   in the    same direction           as the anodic electrotonic
current         If   this true action current be not masked by an over
whelming negative electrotonic variation,                        it   will   appear as      a    positive
variation of the electrotonic current.
     Now let         us take the case of the ascending current                                in fig.     1.
Here the lower galvanometer electrode                            is    in the cathodic region,
and we know              that even        with comparatively weak currents the
cathodic block appears.             B     will therefore, above low limit of current
                                                                           a
density, bo positive to             A     when the nerve              is   excited, and the true
action stream will be descending.                        The cathodic electrotonic current,

however,    is ascending, and the action stream                will appear   as a
negative variation of     it
   These are the considerations             which    led me to expect that        a
positive variation,   if it existed, would he found with strong currents
upon the anodic side, hut not upon the side of the cathode.                     It
was not overlooked that the ordinary electrotonic negative varia
tion might     he so large     as  to reverse     the action current.     Still it
was hoped that, even in this case, indications                might be found in
the curve of the stimulation          effect to show that the expected        true
action current was really in play.

   The first  one or two observations were             made without   compensat
ing the electrotonic currents.          They, indeed, give the same general
results as when compensation was used.                 But it was obvious that   it
would not do to accept        a   positive variation on the evidence of an
uncompensated anodic current.              For it would     be necessary to show

 that the apparent positive variation was not analogous to that which
 the intrapolar    current undergoes        when the nerve is stimulated, the
 so-called " charge of       resistance     effect."    It was found    that after
 compensation the positive variation continued in undiminished                   or
 scarcely diminished amount            Nay     more, over-compensation did not
 abolish, nor begin to abolish it.             Fig.   2  shows the arrangement

     Experiments           1  and    2 are      examples of the           first   method       with
 out       compensation        ;  Experiments          3   and     4,    with compensation.
 It will        be    seen that      on the cathodic           side,    i.e., with ascending
 current, the stimulation effect lias the negative                        sign with reference
 to   the direction          of the polarising          stream.       On      the    side    of    the
 anode       the   same is true up to an electromotive                       force of about 3
 Daniells       working       through       9 mm.     of nerve.       Above this the effect
 becomes positive.              This    is so only when the distance                  C is small.
 In Experiment             4  it is    seen that,      with C =      6A mm., the           positive
 effect does not appear             with     7  Daniells, nor even when              C-3i        mm.
 When C is reduced to               1  mm., it comes in even with                3  Daniells.

     These results suggested          that it might bo still better to put elec
 trodes   B and C in       contact, so as practically           to make them one elec
 trode.     Of   course    it was here necessary            to attend to compensation
 oven more       strictly than before         ; for the danger of          a  direct escape
 of current was greater than before               ;  but so long as the galvanometer
 circuit was fully compensated,             even such an escape would introduce
 no error.

    With     1   D Rh.      100   f    a   small positive deflection          was    got.     I
have a good many times observed                  that when Die nerve is perfectly
fresh, the polarising current very weak, and the reading taken                           very
soon after closure,       a  positive stimulation effect is got on the side                  of
the cathode.       This would suggest            that the conductivity          around the
cathode is not reduced immediately on closing                        such  a   current, but
may even be increased.              This     agrees     with what      I saw   occasionally
when stimulating in the middle of the intrapolar area, with, the
muscle     attached.       Sometimes with weak currents the descending
was more       favourable      than      the ascending for getting contraction.
This never      happened      when the currents were fairly strong.

different in purpose from mine and essentially different in method,
found that the cathodic block took time for its establishment, and
that, when      it appeared,    it appeared     suddenly.
   In the example given in Experiment                   5 the  initial positive    effect
is seen    to chaoge     in 30" into     a negative effect thrice as great,          and
this negative effect then gradually increases with still longer time
of closure.
   In order to diminish,        as far as possible, the irregularities           in the
deflection, which are always a source of trouble with strong electro-
tonic currents, especially on the anodic side,                  I  thought of using
the currents led off to the galvanometer from two separate nerves of
the same frog to compensate            one another, a method resembling some
what in principle         that which       Hermann has used in some of his
polarisation work.          Then, on exciting one of the nerves, one ought
to get the stimulation           effect,  weakened,       of course,     by the extra
resistance of the second nerve.                The same battery was connected
with both       nerves, so that irregularities in the battery itself might
be eliminated.        The result was very satisfactory.
    Figs.   3 and 4 show the arrangement.
    In   the arrangement of fig. 4 two nerves were placed                       on two
separate sets of electrodes A, B,            D; A',   B', D', a compensator      (Com.)

    The     pieces of nerve      BD, B'D'      were made      as nearly as possible
 equal in length, and therefore the current would have nearly the
same density       in  each.    The eleetrotonic currents in AB, A'B' would
be nearly equal,        and they would pass through the galvanometer in
opposite      directions.      The balance       was completed by means           of the
compensator.

would therefore be           more nearly equal in the two than with the
arrangement of fig.          3.    As before, a compensator was put in the

   Experiment         7 shows     the change of sign on the anodic side even
with   2  D.       The negative       effect on the side of the cathode seems
here to diminish         with increase       of current, and this might suggest
that with still stronger currents              a positive phase might be found.
I cannot     say that    I have    found any trace of such an effect, and it is
only in exceptional         cases   that the diminution       in the negative effect
appears.

   It   was now desirable to compare                  the amount of the intra- and
extrapolar stimulation effects           ;   and in order to avoid the uncertainty
which must always exist when                   one tries to get quantitative     com
parisons from experiments made on different days with different
nerves,     I  determined to control the other observations by means
of   a set  in which the intrapolar and extrapolar regions of               the same
nerve were led off alternately to the galvanometer.                     It was parti
cularly     important to notice how the ratio between the amount of
the two effects varied with varying density of polarising current
when the latter was nearly strong enough to suppress                   the intrapolar
effect altogether.
    The arrangenient is shown in fig.                 5 for the case where the two
extrapolar regions compensate                 each othor, and the two intrapolar
regions are placed one in each coil of a differential galvanometer.
    A, B, C, D are, as before, the               electrodes   of one of the nerves    ;
A', B', C, D' those of the other.                  G, G'   are the two coils of the
differential    galvanometer      ;   P    is a Pohl's commutator without cross
wires, by means of which either                AB or CD      may be joined on to    G ;
P    is a Pohl with cross wires, to alter the direction of the polarising
current    ; Com. is a compensator to complete the compensation when

thrown either into CD or into         CD'.
   The balancing arrangement was used for the intrapolar currents
in order to diminish        the irregularity     in  the deflection, which     is
much more troublesome         than even in extrapolar experiments.            Of
course, only one nerve was stimulated.
        i
                                     Fig. 5.
   The circuit of G' was broken by             a  simple key, whenever the
extrapolar regions were to be connected            with G.    The current was
then passed through CD, compensation completed in the galvano
meter circuit, and the stimulation effect read          off.   After the nerves
had recovered,    the two intrapolar regions were thrown on to            G and
G', the extrapolar being off.           The same current was now passed
again  in the   same direction, for the same length of time, and the
stimulation    effect again    taken.     A   given number of cells would
give practically the same current density         in CD, whether the alterna
tive circuit  CD'    was open or closed, since the internal        resistance of
the battery is very small compared         with the   resistance of the nerves.
   Experiments     8, 9, and 10 (pp. 246,    247) are examples of this method
as  applied to currents near the      limiting intensity. An electromotive
force of about 5 Daniells working through 9 mm. of nerve gives the
 density corresponding to the disappearance           of the intrapolar effect.
 This limiting electromotive      force   will  be inversely as the length     of
nerve included in the circuit,     if  we assume that the specific resistance

of nerve in the longitudinal direction ia a constant       Of  course  it will
vary slightly    even  for the two nerves of the same frog, as it will
depend mainly at least upon the amount and kind of the dissolved
crystalloids.    In my former results on the intrapolar      effect  I  found
that   the limiting electromotive force varied from       8  to 9 Daniells,
when the length of     nerve was from     12 to 14 mm.      The two sets of
experiments     therefore agree as well as one is entitled to expect in
observations of this sort.     The strength of stimulus, of course, has
also to he taken into account.
   Experiments      12 and 13 show how the effect        in  the extrapolar
region reaches a maximum, while in the intrapolar it declines to             a
minimum.       This of itself is quite enough      to dispose    of the pos
sibility that the suppression of the intrapolar       effect is due to the
decline of excitability at the point of stimulation through the spread
of anelectrotonus.
    Experiment    14 is an example   of stimulation on the cathodic side.

     Fig. 6  shows the curve of the effect in Experiment        12  plotted to
 scale.
     The   number of points are      too few    to determine     the details.
  Almost the whole of the ascent lies very nearly in       a straight line.

                                Summary of Results.
   1.   With weak currents            there is the ordinary negative variation
both on anodic and cathodic side, however close the galvanometer
and polarising circuits may be brought to each other.
   2.   As the strength          of  the polarising current is increased,             the
negative     variation on the anodic side passes into              a positive variation,
which increases and apparently reaches                a  maximum.
   3.   The maximum of the positive anodic variation corresponds to
a density of current which is not far from that for which the intra-
polar variation is at its minimum (zero).
   4. On the cathodic side the variation is always negative with
currents above the very weakest.                (With very weak currents, fresh
nerves,    and     short period of flow, sometimes             a small positive varia
tion seems to be got.)
   5.   The greater the distance between              the polarising and        galvano
meter circuits, the stronger must the polarising current be for which
the positive anodic variation first appears.
   All    these     results hold when the electrotonic currents are com
pensated.

research, embracing the effect of stimulation                  on tho whole of          the
polarisation phenomena               of nerve and muscle.         I   should just      like
to    say,    that it is by no means             impossible that        a   real   positive
electrotonic variation may bo mixed up witli a true action current
in the positive direction.

Notice of Fundamental Tables in Trigonometry and
       Astronomy, arranged according to the Decimal
       Division of the Quadrant. By E. Sang, LL.D.
                               (Bead   June 3, 1889.)
                                 Canon    of Sines.
    In January of     1878, there was laid on the Society's             table the
Canon of Sines to each fifth minute of the decimal division of the
quadrant, computed to thirty-three           for thirty places    ; along with a
detailed record of every step in the process.                 During the      years
1880-81, this work was continued for each single minute, but only
to eighteen for fifteen places, and the record thereof to fifteen places
is now submitted.        "When the rejected figures were from 497 to 503
a mark of interrogation        is recorded,    and it is believed that not         a
single error exists in the work.          The arrangement of the sines with
their first and second     differences in position enables        us instantly to
detect an error.
    That fifteen   places   suffice   for all possible practical purposes,        is
made clear    by this consideration, that the Earth's distance from             the
Sun, measured      in inches, is     represented     by the number 6, twelve
removes from the unit's place, that is         6 000 000 000 000      ; and that,
if  we take this as the radius of our circle, the figure        1 in tho fifteenth
decimal    place  will represent       -006  or the 170th part of an inch.
Thus the    present canon gives, on this circle, the co-ordinates of the
ten thousand points in the quadrant, each true to within tho tliree-
hundredth     part of an inch.
    The  process followed    in this work      differs,  in  one very important
respect, from that used by previous computers.                 The sine of the
.'inallest tabular arc has hitherto been found indirectly by help of
repeated bisections    ; in the present work the quinquisection of         the arcs
has been accomplished directly by the solution of the appropriate
equations of the fifth degree, according to the method described in
my treatise    " On   the Solution       of Equations of all Orders."          The
ease and rapidity      of this method       are well shown       by the recorded
details of the work for the various equations,          to thirty decimal places.

pared, the rest of the work was carried on              in the usual manner
with verifications at frequent intervals.
                              Logarithmic     Sines.
   The logarithmic      sines were    deduced from the sines themselves
by help of my fifteen-place table of logarithms of numbers from
100 000     to   370 000, using      the auxiliary table.         Beginning      at
100° 00', the computations were made on scroll paper for each single
minute down to 50° 00', each step being verified by first, second,
and third differences.       The third    differences   were   then copied into
their places oh the actual manuscript, and the others were thence
reconstructed.     In  this way all errors of transcription were avoided,
and any mistake in the previous work detected.
    From this half of the    canon, the other half, namely from 50° 00' to
00° 00', was deduced according to the formula sin a =            \ sin 2a . seca   ;
the method of proceeding being to compute each tenth log sine
directly, and to fill in the single terms by differences easily got from
the differences    already written      in the first part.       This operation
supplied a check on all the previous work.
                            Logarithmic    Tangents.
    The logarithmic tangents were computed in the same way, that is
to say, each tenth term was found directly, and the single terms                by
means of the preceding differences,        thus furnishing another verifica
tion of the whole.        But, seeing that the log tangents of the one
half  are the arithmetical complements          of those of the other half,       it
 was enough to write out the log tangents             of  arcs from 50° 00' to
 00° 00'.
    With the exception of the arrangement for computing by differ
 ences, and for assuring exactitude, this is the very process            used by
 Nepair in the construction of his Canon Mirificus                ;  and, indeed,
 this  volume of Logarithmic          Sines and Tangents might, with all
 propriety, have been     entitled : —
    " John Nepair's wonder-working Canon, changed by his
                                                                          express
 desire, to suit the Denary System of         Arithmetical Notation."
    After  a labour which      must have       occupied his     leisure time for
 more   than the quarter of a century, Kepair had                 published     his

Canon, had experienced its utility, had received the approval of the
scientific world; and yet, foreseeing the advantage of accommodating
his plan to the notation in common use, he at once recommended
the putting of it aside for a far better plan.            No stronger     evidence
can be adduced        in favour of discarding the time-honoured division
by 90 and by 60, and substituting the decimal division                 throughout.

 to a repetition      of the often       fruitlessly  made   attack on Kepler's
 famous problem, and this time an unexpectedly                   simple solution
 presented   itself.    The Royal Academy of Sciences of Turin did me
 the very great honour of giving that solution a place among their
 memoirs.      The subject, however, may be treated               more    generally
 and even more       simply, thus : —
    Let  us suppose       ourselves to be studying the apparent relative
 motion of     a  binary system        of stars  ;  each one seems to describe
 round the other an ellipse, and the areas passed over by the radius
 vector are proportional to the elapsed times.             But, since the actual
 orbit may be inclined anyhow to the plane on which it appears                    to
 be projected, the one star does not appear to be            in the   focus of the
 orbit of the other     ;  nor is the diameter drawn through its apparent
 place,  necessarily be the major            axis.   If we  divide    the periodic
 time into equal portions, the corresponding               vectors   will similarly
 divide the area of the ellipse, and hence the problem virtually comes
 to be this, —
                 " to subdivide      the area of an ellipse by lines diverging
 from some point within it."
    The line from the        eye to the revolving star defines       the surface of
 a cone,  in our imaginary        case sensibly of a cylinder, and the planes
 passing through         the eye, and along the vectors,           subdivide    this
 cylinder into wedges.          If now    this system be cut by any plane, the
 section so made        will  have   its area also subdivided      ;  now we can
 always cut a cylinder so that its section may be a circle, and thus,
 ultimately, the problem becomes this,
                                                   " to subdivide the area of a
 circle by lines diverging from         a  point within it."
    If S  represent the point given within the circle described round
 the centre O, the diameter          ASOa will represent the line of apsides,
 A  being the perihelion, a the aphelion.             Let now Q correspond to

252           Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinburgh.            [sess.
some position      of the planet, then the surface      comprised between
AS, SQ, and      the arc  AQ, is proportional to the time elapsed from
the planet, being in the position A, till its reaching the position
corresponding to Q, so that this surface is the planet's mean anomaly.
    Draw now      ESF    perpendicular   to AQ, then the arc      AE, which
has the     excentricity   OS for its  cosine,  may be    called the arc of
 excentricity  ;  we shall denote   it by  e ; while   AQ, the   arc defining
the planet's position, may be denoted by p.         Having joined EQ, FQ,
 it is seen, by mere inspection, that the mean       anomaly AEQS is half
 the sum of the two circular segments cut off by the chords FQ, EQ,
 or that
             mean anomaly =      J{segm(p + e)  + scgm(/)  - e)}  ,
 and so a table of circular     segments   would enable us to determine
 the mean anomaly when the position is given, and conversely the
 position when the mean anomaly is given.
     In order to avoid the frequent multiplication      and division by the

number ir, we measure the areas of the segments not in parts of the
square of the radius, but in parts of the surface                    of the circle      ; a
superficial degree being the sector standing on                a degree   of arc.
     For the construction of such          a table,   it was necessary       to compute
the canon of sines measured              in parts of the quadrant.             The sines
for the single         degrees    were   therefore computed by simple multi
plication     of the ordinary         sines, to serve       as   verifications of the
subsequent work.            Afterwards      those   for each quarter degree were
obtained by using the previous multiples of                   2 ver.   25' for second
differences;       these   two    operations completely checked each other.
Again the        sines   for each     fifth minute       were   got by help of the
multiples of       2 ver.  5'.    But, as the computations were carried only
to the tenth decimal of the quadrant, the products by                    2 ver. 1' were
not needed.

     In  this way the " Canon of Sines measured                     in  degrees       now
 presented was completed,            the actual      volume      contains      the whole
 details of the work, and it is hoped without                    any error exceeding
 two units in       the tenth place.
                            Canon of Circular Segments.
     Since    the number which expresses the area of a segment                            in
 degrees    of surface is the difference between           those which        express the
 arc and its sine,      it follows that the       second    differences    in   the  table
 of circular segments are identic with those of the sines                  ;   and there
 fore the canon of segments               was   constructed      directly    from    those
 second     differences.       In  the present volume it is extended to the
 entire circumference, that is to forty thousand minutes, and shows
  the value of each segment true to within two or three                      units in the
  ten-thousandth parts of the centesimal second.                   Its  accuracy,     thus,
  is very far beyond any requirement in actual astronomy.                       This work
  furnished another check on that for the canon of sines measured in
  degrees.
      This table of circular       segments    enables us very easily to discover
  the mean anomaly when the angle of position is known.                          The con
  verse problem,
                      " to find the angle of position from the mean anomaly/'
   has to be solved by approximation ; which                  is sufficiently rapid        if
   the first assumption be not very wide of the mark.                    When, for the

orbit of some particular planet, we are computing the positions at
equal intervals of time, attention              to the differences       reduces     the
labour to little more than that of writing out the results.                       It   is
only when a sporadic case is presented                that the approximation           is
attended    with any difficulty.
                                 Mean Anomalies.
    In order    to obviate even        this difficulty,      a table has been con
structed of the mean anomalies for orbits of each degree of excen-
tricity, and for every degree of the angle of position, up to 200°                     in
each of these orbits.         This table     enables us, in every possible         case,
to get at once a     first assumption so near        as   to make the subsequent
 approximation quite easily.
     This table   is presented      in two     forms.      In   the volume marked
 mean anomalies      A,   the values are given to four decimal places of a
 second.     In the corresponding volume marked B, they                    are written
 only to the nearest       second ; but the differences            and the variation
 from one orbit to another are inserted.                   Hence, by the ordinary
 method of interpolation         for two variables,        we can solve      both the
 direct and the inverse problem with precision sufficient for all the
 purposes   of practical astronomy.
     My intention      was   to have     computed also the radii vectors            and
 the   true anomalies.         For this, however, the only available trigo
 nometrical tables       were those to seven places printed in a most
 inconvenient     form, by Callet, in his Tables Portatives.                 The work
 was scarcely     begun when it became             apparent that       the    precision
 attainable    was    not   commensurate         with the        labour.    Therefore,
 putting that work         aside,   I   preferred to undertake         the hopeless-
 looking task of computing the logarithmic sines and tangents                       to a
  greater number of places.          This work is fortunately accomplished,
  although there     still remain the transcription in the order usually
  adopted  for convenient reference.
     The application of these tables to the computation of the true
  anomalies,   is a task far too great to be undertaken at the close of a
  long life, and, not without         reluctance,   it  is left to the zeal of other
  computers.      Enough, that      I  have been enabled to place          within the
  reach of mathematicians some contributions                to the progress of exact
  science.

   The convenience of having the true anomaly, and the planet's
distance alongside of the time-argument, would           be eo great     as  to
dwarf altogether that of having merely the angle of position           ;   this
last mentioned forms, indeed, only a step toward the obtaining of
the others.    The remaining operation, implying         only the solution
of a right-angled    triangle, is easy though laborious.     It  may, there
fore, be not inopportune to indicate here the course most convenient
to  be followed    in the subsequent work; particularly        because    that
which may appear to be the most rapid in an isolated          case, may not
be the best for systematic work.

From       those     we easily get the tangent of the true anomaly                                 ASP,
and thence the distance SP.                    Here the great part of the labour is
in finding          the logarithm           of SH, the angle               HSP        from       its log
tangent, the log secant from the angle, and                           SP from its logarithm                  ;
that is to say, in using the tables of the logarithms of numbers, and
of circular functions            to a considerable number of                        decimal places.
This labour,        repeated     for each of the twenty thousand cases to be
tabulated, rises to a formidable total.
     But    if,   on the perpendicular diameter AOA', we describe another
ellipse having SS' for its minor axis, and consequently                                  *   and   »'   for
its foci, and      if   from   Q    we draw the ordinate Qph, we have, accord
ing to the properties of the ellipse,                    SP ¦=OA fph, and conversely
SP    =   OA ± PH.        Thus the computation of the ordinates in the one
of the two orbits gives us, with only the labour of                                      writing        the
numbers in their places, the vectors of the other orbit, and we are
now enabled to compute the true anomaly from its log sine.                                       "When
following this course,          it   will   be convenient to begin                   with the orbit

The Development of Diarthrodial Joints in Birds and

       Senior Demonstrator       of Anatomy, University of Edinburgh.

                              (Read May 20, 1889.)
     After giving   a summary of recent        literature on the subject, the
author then proceeded        to state the nature of the material which he
had employed in the present investigation.
     The bird selected was the common fowl {Gallus domest.), and he
had examined a series         of microscopic      sections  through the limbs
 from the fourth day of incubation to the day of hatching.
     The mammalian embryos examined were mice and rabbits, and
 the fingers    of the human foetus from an embryo approaching the
 full period of uterogestation.
     Method    of Preparation. — The embryo chicks              were   prepared,
 partly    by hardening     in picrosulphuric       acid and partly     in dilute
 solutions of nitric acid.      The human embryos were also hardened in
 nitric acid.    The embryos were then dehydrated with alcohol, stained
 in borax-carmine, and cut with the Cambridge rocking microtome,
 the average thickness of the sections being '006 mm.
     The    author   expressed   his indebtedness to        Mr George Brook,
  Lecturer on Embryology         in   the  University of Edinburgh,        under
  whoso guidance and      in  whose laboratory the investigation had been
  conducted, and then proceeded           to give a summary of the results
  which he had attained.
      At  the end of the fourth day of incubation the wing of the chick
  is  in the form of     a bud, *8 mm.      long, and consists of a mass of
  mesoblast    cells enveloped in    a covering of epiblast.       At this   stage
  the cells of the mesoblast        present   no differentiation    into separate
  structures, but at the end of the fifth day the free extremity of the
  limb   has assumed a bulbous form, and horizontal sections show that
  along certain lines a process of condensation has occurred, apparently
   presaging the positions of future bone            matrices.   The individual
  cells in these portions present no great change           from the rest of the

surrounding mesoblast,        except such variations in outline as can be
accounted for by compression.
    As growth     proceeds, digits emerge from the bulbous extremity, and
a section      at the end of the        ninth day shows that a process of
differentiation has taken place        in the condensed portions, the result
of which     is the formation    of cartilaginous rods    separated   from each
other by masses of undifferentiated cells termed the articular disc or
inter-tissue.
    It is in connection with this articular disc that the future joint
cavity and its various appendages            are developed.      Here the joint
cavity makes its appearance,         and may be seen in the wing of the
chick at the end of the ninth day.            The cleft commences within the
circumference of the articular disc and extends towards the axis of
the disc, so as to divide it into two segments, each of which is applied
to the end of a cartilaginous rod, and the segments are held together
by its undivided periphery.            The  sides of the cleft are bounded by
 a layer of flattened cells.
    When this cleft        does   not extend across the axis of the disc,
 material is left for the formation of an interarticular ligament,               as
 may be seen in sections taken from the leg of               a  chick about the
 middle of the second week.
    In the   case of some     joints two cavities      appear, having between
them a portion         of the    disc,   which   ultimately    develops    into   a
meniscus.        Again, when the two cavities fuse in the axis of the
disc, we have an incomplete meniscus.
    Even at this early stage there is a certain amount of moulding of
the ends of the cartilaginous           rods which foreshadows their future
shape, and as this occurs at a time when the muscular system                  is in
abeyance,      it cannot   be the result of movement,       and neither can wo
ascribe the formation of the cavity to this cause.
    Tracing the changes        which take place       in connection     with    the
various parts of the now partially divided articular disc, we find that
the segments applied to the ends of the cartilaginous rods gradually
become     differentiated into hyaline cartilage,        until this  process has
affected   the whole thickness       of the segment, with the exception of
the row of flattened cells next the cavity of the joint.            In the chick
these are found      still persisting   at the period of hatching.
    The undivided       circumference of the disc has meanwhile under

gone differentiation             into fibrous tissue, and in            it   may be found the
rows of cells and wavy fibres characteristic of that structure.                               This
fibrous capsule also continues to be lined by a row of flattened cells
continuous with those on the surface of the articular cartilages.                                 A
similar scries of changes                may be         traced in connection with inter-
articular fibro-cartilages and ligaments.
   In   mammals            the formation        of the articular disc and the appear
ance of the   joint cavity,              as seen        in embryo      mice    and rabbits, are
practically identical with               those    just    described.         There is therefore
no reason to doubt that the subsequent changes                               in the component
parts of the disc are also similar.
  There    is,   however, one striking difference in connection with the
layer of flattened cells which line the cavity, and this was observed
on the articular            cartilages    taken         from the phalangeal joints of             a
human foetus approaching the full period of uterogestation.                                  Here
the usual flat cells were found                   lining the interior of           the capsular
ligament, but on tracing them towards the articular cartilages they
were seen to be replaced             by   a   narrow band, staining somewhat more
freely than the hyaline cartilage, but presenting no cell structure.
The free surface of this band was slightly ragged, and                               it   appeared
to be undergoing degeneration.                     Thus    it   would appear that the flat
cells lining the primitive joint cavity have                    a   double fate.          Those in
relation to tho ligamentous structures, and thus within reach of                                  a
direct blood supply, become specialised into                        a   synovial membrane;
whereas those         in relation    to the articular cartilages,             although present
in the chick          at the period of hatching,                probably disappear as the
result of friction         ;   while, in the case of the mammal,                   they undergo
degenerative      changes,        which lead to their early disappearance                     from
the same cause.
                                 Summary         of Conclusions.
   1.   The bone matrices            and the articular disc possess                a   tissue con
tinuity, and are derivative                of    a      common blastema            of which the
articular disc        is   at first the undifferentiated form.
   2.   The articular disc may conduct itself as follows                       : —
         (a)     It    may      develop into         a    plate of cartilage and form             a
                       synchondrosis,           e.g.,    the articulation        between      basi-
                       occipital and basi-sphenoid bones.

               (ft)   It    may differentiate        into       fibrous tissue           and    form       a
                           syndesmosis       or synarthrosis,
                (c)   It   may partially cleave and form               a    joint cavity.
     3.   The joint cavity appears within the articular disc at                                a   period
when the process of chondrification                         is   at some distance from the
cavity.
     4.   If the      cavity remain of small size, and the surrounding articular
disc develop into fibrous tissue, an amphiarthrosis                                 is   formed, e.g.,
the joint between vertebral bodies.                            (This    is      specially well       seen
in   some        Oetacea, and probably the epiphyseal plates on the bodies
of   vertebrae         are also derived from the articular disc.)
     5.   The cavity may enlarge to form                    a    diarthrosis.
     6.   When         the   joint cavity     is   single we have           a   simple diarthrosis     ;
when there are two cavities we have                    a    diarthrosis with an interposed
meniscus        ;     when the two clefts unite in the centre                            we have       an
incomplete meniscus              ;    when the cleft        is   single, but does not extend
across the axis of the disc, an interarticular                       ligament       is   formed.
     7.   The proximal              and     distal   segments          of     the    articular       disc
develop into the articular cartilages of the joint, and probably form
part,     if   not all, of the epiphyseal ends of the bones.
     8.   The circumference of                 the articular         disc develops into              the
capsule of the joint.
     9.   Interarticular         fibrocartilages and ligaments are derived from
the articular disc            as the   result of modifications of the joint cavity.
 10.      The cells lining           the   joint cavity     have    a   double fate       : —
            (a) Those applied to the ligamentous                                    structures       arc
                   specialised as synovial membrane.
           (ft) Those          upon        the articular         cartilage persist until             the
                           period    of     hatching      in     the    chick,        but      undergo

    In continuation of experiments           on the electricity      of air within
doors, which     I made twenty -seven years ago, and which are described
in  §§   29G-300 of my Electrostatics and Magnetism,                a series  of ob
servations was commenced          under my instructions at the end of          April
last,   within   the  Natural    Philosophy      Class Room and Laboratory,
the Bute Hall, the University           Tower, and other places inside and
outside the buildings of Glasgow University, by            Mr Magnus Maclean,
official assistant    to the   Professor of Natural        Philosophy,      and  Mr
Goto of Tokio, Japan,         for the purpose       of endeavouring to find a
relation between the electrification of air within            a  building and the
atmospheric potential in its neighbourhood outside               ; and   of finding
causes which produced or changed               the electrification    of any given
 mass of air.
    A   large number of series of observations have been made                 by Mr
 Maclean and Mr Goto on the potentials of water-dropping collectors
 within     the building,  and at different points outside           the   building.
 Hitherto no definite relation has been discovered               between     the ex
 ternal potential and the potential at different points within large
 enclosures,    such as the Bute      Hall    and   smaller rooms of the        Uni
 versity Buildings.       The weather has been for the most part very-
 settled and the external potential almost always positive in all posi
 tions from    a few feet above the       ground to the top of the University
 Tower; while       the potential  within    doors here, in the new      University
 Buildings, on the top of Gilmour            Hill, just as   in the old College,
 down in the densest       part of Glasgow, was always negative except
 sometimes     in the Natural     Philosophy     Lecture Room and Apparatus
 Room, where there were considerable disturbances, undoubtedly due
 to the electric light     wiring.      In   one ordinarily     unused room (the
 Physical Apparatus Museum) 31^ feet long by 24 feet broad and
 about 20 feet high, practically quite free from any sensible dis
 turbance by electric light wires, or by electrical operations being
 performed in the Laboratory,         a  remarkable result has been observed
within     the past fortnight.     The electric potential of      a  water-dropper

having     its nozzle at the centre    of the room and about          7 feet above
the floor, was always found about         2 volts negative at the commence
ment of the observations, and always increased               to about 9 volts      in
the course of the first twenty minutes of a series of observations last
ing generally forty minutes.        During    the last twenty minutes of the
series the potential      remained somewhat nearly constant at              9  volte.
 Within the      room, two quadrant electrometers,         each    with   an ordin
 ary paraffin lamp and scale, were used        ; one of them for the outside
 water-dropper, and the other for the water-dropper within the room.
     Towards ascertaining the cause of this change, an observation was
 made on the 4th       July,  between   10 and 11       a.m.    The lamps were
 both extinguished, and one of them was lighted by               a  lucifer    match
 every five minutes for the       purpose   of reading the electrometer           de
 flection.    It  was  found that in     these circumstances there was not
 the increase     of negative potential which had been found in every
 previous series of observations in the same place, and with all other
 circumstances the       same, except     the burning      of the     lamp.     This
 single observation seemed to prove conclusively that the burning of
 the lamp produced a negative change of the air of the room.                  Subse
 quent experiments made by         Mr Goto, with       the electrometer      and its
 lamp and scale outside, and with            paraffin lamps burning           or not
 burning within the room, have confirmed this result, and are being
 continued to discover whether corresponding effects are produced
  by other kinds of flame, or by the presence of eight or nine people
  in  the room.     Mr Maclean and Mr Goto will              also   continue    their
  observations on natural atmospheric electricity, in various localities,
  indoors    and in the open       air, and will,    I   hope,    give a paper to
  the    Royal     Society   of  Edinburgh       early    next    session    on   the
 subject.

    The only observations hitherto recorded               on the placentation of
the Dugong are by Paul Harting,               of Utrecht,       in   1878,   who ex
amined the foetal membranes          of  a foetus 27'8 cent long.           He stated
that the placenta was diffused and non-deciduate.*
    The gravid uterus described in this                communication        was     pre
sented to the author by C. W.            de  Vis, Esq., M.A., curator of             the
Queensland Museum, Brisbane, through Professor Anderson                         Stuart
of the University of Sydney.
    The uterus was bicornuate, and contained              a single foetus,    5 feet 4
inches long.       The foetus and its membranes           occupied the left cornu,
and there was no extension of the membranes                   into the right cornu.
    The chorion was an elongated sac, upwards of                  5   feet long from
pole to pole.
     The placenta formed a zone a little on one side of the equator
of the chorion.         The    zone   was    11£ inches broad          in its widest
 part and    6   inches at its narrowest.           The rest of the chorion was
smooth     and free from villi.      The   villi   were closely crowded together
 in the fcetal placenta      ; as   a rule they were short, though               longer
 villi were interspersed      amongst    them    ;  they were     cylindriform      and
 filamentous in shape, and branched seldom                  except    near their free
 ends.
     The allantois     was   very extensive, and reached            to the opposite
 poles    of the chorion.        Connected      to the     outer wall of its sac,
 formed by the endochorion, were a number of plate-like allantoic
 bodies.
     The amnion was very capacious,           and was completely surrounded
 by the allantois, except         for a limited       area  in the region of the
 placenta.     No amniotic      corpuscles   projected from its inner surface.
     The uterine mucous          membrane      had a zone which           formed the
  maternal placenta, and which corresponded in form,                         size,   and

 position     to the   zone  on the chorion.       This    zone   contained multi
 tudes of short cylindriform        crypts, in which     the  villi of the chorion
 were   lodged.      Longer     and more      deeply placed crypts       were   also
 present for the lodgment of the longer villi.
     The non-placental area of the mucous membrane                was smooth,   and
 corresponded to the non-villous part of the chorion.
     Uterine glands were seen both in the placental and non-placental
 areas of the mucous membrane.              In the placental area they opened
 amidst the crypts by special orifices; in the non-placental area they
 opened obliquely on the smooth surface of the mucous membrane.
    Owing     to the shortness both of the chorionic        villi and the uterine
 crypts and their simple form, it is believed that the placenta,              when
shed in normal parturition, would be generally non-deciduate, in the
sense of the vascular walls of the crypts not being shed along                with
the   villi ; it is not unlikely,    as the author showed some years ago to
be the case in the sheep and cow,* that the epithelial lining of the
crypts may separate more or less, and pass off entangled between the
villi.    It  is also possible that the longer      villi may carry away with
them parts of the vascular walls of their crypts.
    Should      the placenta be        non-deciduate in the        sense that   the
vascular part of the maternal mucous membrane                   is not shed, then
the placenta of the Dugong gives a new                 type of placenta — one
which    is both zonary and generally non-deciduate.
    The diffused character of the placenta in the specimen described
by Paul Harting        was due to its comparatively early stage of develop
ment, for the      villi had not   as yet limited    themselves to a denfinite
zone.
    The paper concluded by a comparison of the placentation of the
Dugong with that more especially of the Cetacea, Carnivora,                    and
Proboscidea,      and by      remarks on the       bearings of the form and
structure of the placenta on the classification of the Sirenia.

    The subject of the present paper has occupied my attention for
some years,       but   I   may    state   that what follows is the outcome                 of
notes    prepared      for lectures       to   my students and            is only     a pre

graphical distribution         of some tropical         diseases, and to indicate as
far   as possible   the knowledge which we at present possess of those
physical phenomena which influence the production of these diseases
and the area of their distribution.              Why, for      instance,     some diseases
are confined to limited             areas    of distribution,      whereas       others are
endemic       in   extensive        districts,    and     others    again      periodically
extend      their   ravages      throughout         clearly   defined,      though      wide-
spreading,     regions.
    A   map was published by           A. Keith Johnston in          1856 representing
the geographical distribution            of health and disease, chiefly in con
nection with natural           phenomena;           but although       it    gives   a   great
 deal of information,         it   does not indicate         with sufficient       clearness
 the definite     areas     of the various diseases referred to.                   Since its
publication,      too,    our knowledge          both     as   to  the distribution         of
 tropical diseases and the cause of disease has made                           considerable
 progress.      More      recently     Mr     Alfred llaviland,         M.R.C.S.,         pub
 lished    three    very     valuable       and instructive        maps      dealing with
 the geographical         distribution       in England        and Wales         of    cancer
 in females,     of   phthisis      in females,       and of heart disease.            These
 maps show very strikingly             the influence exerted          on these diseases
 by locality.
     Two maps, illustrating           the distribution       of diphtheria and scarlet
 fever in England and Wales, were published by Dr E. G. Barnes                              in
 the   British Medical Journal, July              28, 1888.       In  the same      Journal
 for January 19, 1889,           there    is a report of the collective Investiga
 tion Committee of the British Medical Association, prepared by                             Dr

   Isambard Owen, on the geographical distribution                 of ricketts, acute
  and subacute rheumatism, chorea,                 cancer,  and urinary calculus in
  the   British Islands      ;  and various maps, illustrating      the geographical
  distribution     of rickett9, chorea, and cancer, have been prepared but
  not published.
      In 1886 the report on the mortality and vital statistics of the
  United     States,   as returned at          the tenth census    (June    1,   1880),
  was published;        and      it contains     some   most instructive    maps     and
  charts showing the distribution               of deaths from various diseases in
  the   United      States,     which indicate to        a certain extent     the geo
  graphical distribution           of those diseases,     as also  the localities      in
 which they        are most prevalent.            None, however, of the publica
 tions     to which       I     have     referred,   nor   any  with which        I   am
 acquainted, attempt to depict graphically the geographical distribu
 tion of tropical diseases in a manner which would give at                    a glance
 the areas throughout the world which are affected                     by them,      and
 their    possible or probable            connection    with physical    phenomena.
 It    must be remembered,             too,  that in the works above mentioned
 the various        authors were         dealing with civilised     districts,    where
 authentic      statistics     were     obtainable,    and where    it  was    possible
 to localise the distribution           of disease in a minute form, which, how
 ever desirable,       it is     at  present completely out of my power                to
 attempt to imitate.
     I propose    to treat my subject on a definite plan.           I intend    first to
 give the name of the disease and its various synonyms;                   secondly, a
 short definition       of the disease, and         a  very brief description of it.
 I   will then sketch out with              some attempt at detail       the geogra
 phical distribution          of the disease, and finally point out as far as
 possible    its relation to various physical phenomena                  as  affecting
 both its causation,       its area, and its epidemic spread.         I may state      at
 the outset, that     I  have taken the definition and description of each
disease from the Dictionary              of Medicine edited by Richard          Quain,
M.D., F.R.S.,        because      the definitions     and descriptions there given
are the generally accepted             ones, and    in  a paper of this character,
which      deals   more     or    less   with broad outlines and general          facts,
it would      be out    of    place to enter into any personal views            I  may
have as to either the cause, the definition, or the description of the
diseases referred to.

      With        regard to the data concerning the geographical distribution
of the diseases,           I am          indebted for my principal                  facts to the      Hand
book     of Geographical and Historical Pathology,                                        by   Dr August
Hirsch,        and to the copious bibliography                           which           accompanies         his
various chapters.               I   have not, however, hesitated                     in any     case where
my own information,                      or information          gathered       from other sources,
modifies          or supplements his data, to make use of the same, and                                        I
have as far as possible                  verified the facts        I   have given.
   The maps which illustrate this paper have been specially prepared
for    it,
      and in order to ensure as great accuracy as  possible on such                is
small maps, the areas of the distribution of the various diseases have
been drawn upon large maps used                               for lecturing purposes, and sub
sequently reduced by photography to the scale suited for publication
in the Proceedings of this Society.
      The maps illustrating some of the physical phenomena with which
lny paper deals are adapted from various sources.                                        The chart of the
world depicting the mean annual temperature                                     of the tropical and
sub-tropical zones           is     taken from the Challenger Report*, and                        is   based
upon         the    most    recent         investigations          on the subject.              The chart
representing the mean annual rainfall                            throughout the world                 is   after
the most recent map published, namely, that in the Contribution* to
Meteorology,            by Professor Elias Loomis (18S9).
      Plate Xo.         1G gives     the isoclinal lines with reference to pandemic
waves of disease, and the prevailing winds upon the ocean.                                            It    has
been compiled from two maps; one published by                                      Dr Robert Lawson
in 1888, and the other by Dr W. S. Wilson in 1881.
I       trust that this paper                may be of special interest to members                            of
my own profession, who                      will    be able to see at          a   glance the diseases
infesting the various districts in the tropics, and who will therefore
be the more readily able to give the necessary advice to patients.                                            It
should be useful to intending emigrants, and of special                                          service to

                                       (See Plate       I.)
    It has  been hitherto the custom               to subdivide the diseases due to
 malaria, or, in other words, to the malarial process,                          but   I am so
 convinced      that the same           cause     produces the various               types    or
 manifestations      of    malaria       that   I     include     them      all  under      one

of which     are not expended          in the growth and sustenance               of healthy
vegetation.       By almost universal             consent,      this poison is regarded
as the cause of all the types              of intermittent         and remittent fevers
commonly       called malarial, and of the degeneration of the blood
and tissues      from long residence              in places       where this       poison is
generated.

     Geographical Distribution.        — The distribution of malaria               is very
 extensive,    although the intensity of the malarial process                   varies    in
 different regions.        Commencing with Africa, we find that on the west
 coast malaria is very prevalent in the basins                     of the Senegal       and
 Gambia,    and on the Guinea coast from Sierra Leone to Cape Lopez,
 especially in the basins of the Niger and Gaboon, on the Ivory and
 Gold coasts,     at  Fernando l'o, and St Thomas.                It diminishes rapidly
 in  intensity until lat. 18° S., where         it disappears.       On the East coast,
 the malarial region commences            in   the south at Delagoa Bay, and ex
 tends northwards as far as 5°        N. lat., including the islands of Zanzibar,
 Madagascar,     "Mauritius,    ISourbon,    and Seychelles.          Areas of endemic
 malaria are also found in the lowlands of Abyssinia                         and    in the
 Somali district,        in the valley of the Nile, from Khartum                    to the
 Great Lakes, west of the Nile between                  Dongola and Khartum, and
 all over Tropical Central Africa,              up to an altitude         of 3000 feet.
 Egypt,    Tripoli, Tunis,         and   Algiers       are   likewise    affected.     The
 malarial process is most intense upon the equatorial African coast
 line until an altitude of 500 feet is reached, and it also extends in
 its gravest form for about 300 miles up the banks of the                       Zambesi,
 the Congo,     and the Niger.
    Malaria is met with in Arabia, on the east coast of the Red Sea,
especially on the coast of Iledjaz, and in Yemen from Jisan south
to Moccha.         It  is also found at Muscat, on the shores            of  the Persian
Gulf and its islands,           and   in the valleys of the             Euphrates       and
Tigris.     It   also     exists in Syria,       especially in the damp valleys
of the Lebanon, in the valley of the Jordan and along the shores of
the Levant;       and this malarious         area extends        to Asia    Minor, from
Adana     and     Tarsus to the        Dardanelles,        including     Smyrna.       The
disease    extends all        round the      Caspian       Sea,    overspreads      Persia,
 lSeloochistan,      and   Afghanistan     ;   and    is met with      all over India,
with the exception of places having                  a  high altitude.        Ceylon too
and Burmah,         Siam, Sumatra, Borneo, New Guinea, the Pliillipine
Islands, Japan, the Andaman Islands and Australia                       as  far south as
lat. 17°, are all affected.        The disease also prevails in           a severe    form
in the tropical and sub-tropical parts of China.
    In Europe       we may commence           by tracing malaria in the steppe
lands of the Caspian.           It  follows the course of the Volga through
Astrakau, includes the central Caucasian plain, and the countries

bordering the Black Sea to the north, the basins of the Dnieper
and Dniester as far          as Ekaterinoslav,     the Crimea, Wallachia,            and
Bulgaria.      There are also endemic areas of malaria in the marshy
plains of western Russia, in many places in the Baltic provinces, and
in the district of Novgorod.           In Galicia malaria       is only endemic         in
Cracow, "Wadowice,          Zolkiewo, and Zloczow; and in Poland only in
the    province of Agustusowo.           One of the largest        malarial areas of
Europe follows the course of the Danube and its tributaries,                        from
the plain of lower Austria, over a great part of Hungary.                     It  is also
endemic in the marshy districts of Croatia, in the damp valleys of
Servia and Montenegro, and in the valley of the Save.                  In  the Balkan
 peninsula there      are various      endemic areas in Roumania,               on    the
 shores of the    Black     Sea and of the Sea of Marmora,           in Albania, and
 northwards      along the coasts       of Dalmatia       and Istria.       In   Greece
 malaria occurs     at many points       in Boetia, Zeituni, Naupantos, and
 Vonitza    ; at Chalcis,      Corinth, Mistra, Navarino, Modon, and many
 other places on the coast.            In  Crete,    Cephalonia, St Maura, and
 Corfu malaria       is   also endemic.       In Italy     there   are two areas of
 endemic malaria, occupying the plain of the Po and its tributaries,
 and the west       coast     from Pisa,    as   far as and including           most     of
 Calabria.      In the Iberian peninsula, malaria            is most     severe    in  the
 southern     and western        coast  regions,    in  the   low-lying     country of
  Andalusia,    on the    marshy banks of rivers, especially the Guadiana
  and    Guadalquiver,        on   the flooded plains        of the Tagus,          Sado,
  Mondego, and other coast rivers of Portugal, on the level coasts of
  Granada and Murcia, and on the plains of Algara and Alemtejo.
  In   France malaria is most prevalent in the western                  and    southern
  parts of the country, especially from the basin of the Loire                 as   far  as
  the Pyrenees.       Another area stretches along the coast of Languedoc
  and Provence.       There are several other small malarial areas, of which
  the plain of Auvergne and the marshy country around Luke Indro
  may be noted.         In Switzerland endemic malaria              is only found        in
  the southern part of the canton Ticino, and in the canton of Valais
  along   the Rhone.          In Austria    the   chief seats of the disease are
   along the Danube, and there are smaller areas in the river valleys
   of upper     Austria,     Salzburg,    Styria,    and Carinthia.         Where       the
   river widens at Krems           we  meet    with    a great    region   of malaria,
   which extends       as  far  as  the Black     Sea.    In south-west Germany

  272         Proceedings        of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                       [sess.
  there are small and isolated areas              where malaria is endemic                on
 the   marshy banks of the rivers or lakes,               e.g., the    valleys near the
  Neckar in the Black Forest.            The more extensive malarial regions
 are on the   banks of the Ehine, in lower Alsace, in the Palatinate,
 in  the Rheingau, and        in  the low grounds of the              Danube, and its
 side valleys  in Wurtemburg         and Bavaria.          In central Germany it           is
 only endemic     in   a  few small districts.           In North Germany it               is
 found in the basins      of the Vistula, Oder, Elbe, Weser, and Rhine.
 Holstein and Schleswig           (west    coast districts), the        coast belt west
 of the Elbe, the moorlands of              Hanover and Oldenburg,, the low
 grounds of Westphalia,         and the plains of Rhenish Prussia are also
 infected.   In   the    Netherlands        malaria     is   mostly      found     in    the
 provinces of Grunland,          Friesland,     and Zealand,        on the coast belt
 of the provinces of north and south Holland, and in the provinces
 of Drenthe     Overyssel.        Belgium,      AYest     Flanders, East Flanders,
 and Antwerp       are    affected.      The disease       also occurs       in Laaland
 and Falster, on the         Hvalben islands, and in the neighbourhood
 of Fredericstadt.       In Sweden it          is  endemic       at    three   principal
 points — around Lakes Maler             and Werner,          on the      east   coast    of
 Torhamn, and at the mouth of several coast streams, such                           as the
 Angermanna-elf, the Dal-elf, and Gotta-elf.                   In Britain,      the East
 Biding of Yorkshire,       the Fen       district, Essex and Kent, the banks
of the Thames in Surrey, and the south marsh of Somersetshire,                           are
slightly infected by malaria.
    In  the  western hemisphere, endemic                   malarial      fever    of    the
 severest  type has its principal         seats in    the    West      Indies,    on    the
Mexican Gulf coast, and in Brazil, but considerable                   regions    of fever,
though of a less intense kind, are met with                in  the northern parts of
the Pacific   coast of South         America, and in the southern, central,
and prairie States of the        Union.       All  the West      Indian Islands         are
affected,  save Antigua,        St Yincent, and Barbadoes,                the  Bahamas
and the Bermuda group,          in which islands it is rarely           seen.
    In South America       the   worst centre of malaria            is the east coast,
including the ports of Carthagena,             Maracaybo, and Puerto Cabell o.
and the country of Guiana.                Another     extensive       area covers      the
whole of the north of Brazil          as  far   as Rio   de Janeiro,       the banks of
the Amazon,     Rio Madeira, Maranhao, Paranahyba, San Francisco,
Parana,   Rio   Doce,    and    their tributaries     ;  also the     island of Santa

  Caterina and the marshy districts of the provinces of Piauhy, Para,
  Mato-Grosso, Goyas, and Minos Geraes.                   Endemic      malaria is also
  found in the prairie lands of Paraguay and Bolivia, particularly in
  the provinces of Tucumana,            Salta, and Santa Cruz.               Chili    and
  Peru are also affected, and the disease extends thence along the coast
  to Ecuador, probably also to New Granada.
      The disease is found       all over Central         America, but it is          less
  severe   on the Pacific     coast, except at Corinto.         In Mexico malaria
  is most prevalent on the Atlantic coast, and is less frequently seen
  everywhere up to 3000 feet in height, except on the                          tableland
  proper (Anahuac).          On the Pacific coast of Mexico malaria is
 confined to Acapulco, Tepic, and the strip of coast from San Bias to
  Mazatlan.
      In the   United States from the Rio            del   Xorte    a great     malarial
  field extends all over the Gulf coast to Cape                  Florida,     spreading
 far into the interior along the Colorado, Brazos,                   and Mississippi
 and their tributaries.       In Texas     the malarial region         stretches    from
 the coast into the highlands          as far as    Fort Duncan in Eagle           Pass,
 and Fort       Makavit.      In New Mexico             malaria     is   very    widely
 diffused, the limit       of its prevalence     being      Santa Fe.        From     the
 western part of the Louisiana           coast, between the Sabine and the
 Mississippi, the malarial region extends across the zone of bluffs in
 that State, over    a great   part of Arkansas, especially along the banks
 of the Mississippi     and Arkansas       rivers, over the marshy plains of
 the north-east of the country             towards Missouri, and over the
 eastern    part of the Indian territory,          including      Fort Gibson and
 Fort Still.     In the peninsula of Florida malaria          is only met       with   on
 the Gulf coast, especially in Escambia and Tambabay, and at Fort
Meade.       In Georgia    we find  it in  the creeks along the coast            In the
Central States of the Union malaria is met with in South Carolina,
North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland,               and to    a moderate       extent
in Tennessee and Kentucky.              It   is also found within          the prairie
States    proper, e.g.,    in Ohio,     Indiana,      Illinois,    Missouri,      Iowa,
Minnesota, Wisconsin,          and Michigan.         In   rio case, however, does
malaria extend farther north than 46° 10' N. (Fort Ripley).                            In
the southern parts of the State of Michigan malaria skirts both
shores of     Lake St Clair to its junction with                Lake     Huron,      and
the southern shores of Lakes Erie and Ontario                     as   far  as the     St

Lawrence.        Severe      malarial fever is found at Fort Gratiot, Detroit
and Plymouth,         on the      United      States   side   of the Lake        ;   and at
Amhurstbury,        Fort Maldon, and Sandwich,                on the Canadian side.
On the northern side of Lake Ontario malaria extends from Hamilton
to Kingston,      and up the ridge of hills which runs along the shore
from Burlington to the mouth of the Trent, attaining in some places
an altitude of 600 feet.           Endemic malaria extends also to the north
western      parte of the State of New             York, although       there     are many
localities now free from fever.             It  is most frequently met with along
the banks of the Hudson and on a narrow strip of coast.                             During
recent years the disease has increased                in the mountain districts             of
New York and also in Pennsylvania.                      In the New England States
the disease is endemic          at only   a  few points, and it is not endemic in
the greater part of British North America.                   Malaria, as an epidemic,
is met with on the banks of the St Lawrence and its tributaries, and
on Lake      St Peter,    as  well  as at   Montreal and Quebec, and at various
coast    places,    such     as  Halifax (N.S.) and Miquelon (N.F.).                        In
Nova Scotia (except at           Halifax), in New Brunswick, and in Green
land, the disease is quite unknown.                  In  western   North America the
limit of malaria      reaches somewhat higher latitudes.                  It is met with
chielly      on the      slopes    and      valleys     of   the    Fiocky     Mountains
and   in  the territories of Wyoming,             Utah,    and Colorado.           In Cali
fornia    there    are     considerable      malarial regions,        especially up the
valleys of the Sacramento              and    San Joaquin,        and    in   the     inland
southern part of the State of Arizona.

    Remarks. — Of the malarial fevers,                           the intermittent         is the most
 widely distributed            type,      and it will be noticed that the remittent
 and pernicious fevers are only                         met      with in comparatively small
 areas, and that they are, as a rule, confined to tropical or sub-tropical
countries.         A  glance at the map               will show, without further              specifica
 tion, their distribution.                It    may be noted, however, that the                    quo
tidian and quartan types of intermittent                              fever are those which are
 most frequently met with                  in the tropics, and that the Tertian type
is  that form which is most widely distributed in the more temperate
zones.       In   fact, the type of fever stands                   in    a definite relation to the
intensity of the malarial process                   ;     thus we find that the Tertian type
prevails       in those regions within the                           tropics where the           milder
malarial fevers are indigenous.                         Again, the frequency of the occur
rence   of the quotidian type of fever in                        endemics     or in epidemics is in
direct proportion to the severity of the disease.                              When      an epidemic

276              Proceedings          of Royal             Society     of Edinburgh.                      [sess.
wave of malarial fever passes over                         a   district, the Tertian type is seen
at its outbreak, whereas at the height of an epidemic, or whenever
it   assumes a severe character,                 the quotidian type obtains, and as the
outbreak of sickness abates one meets with a return to the types of
fever having a longer interval                        between the paroxsyms, so that in
tropical and sub-tropical countries the fever takes on the Tertian type,
and in the higher latitudes the quartan type makes its appearance.
These remarks apply also to outbursts of the disease where                                                it   is
endemic.         In   temperate        zones remittent malarial fevers                       are exceed
ingly uncommon, in                 fact,    so    uncommon                 as   to be regarded             as a
departure from the ordinary type and as due to exceptional causes.
      All   races may suffer from malaria, although the Negroes are less
prone to       it,   always provided that they do not migrate.                                   Indeed,       it
is    very generally acknowledged                          that      in all parts of             the    world
strangers      suffer       more      severely         from malaria than does the indi
genous        population.          The      incidence             of malaria         is     to   a     certain
extent governed by                  the seasons.                In     those      places    where         it   is
endemic       it     occurs     all    the       year          round   ;    but    where     it      is   only
slightly developed             there are two maxima — one                        in spring and one
in autumn, and              a   considerable decrease                       of the disease in the
months        between          them.         In regions with strongly                            developed
malaria, there         is  a   maximum beginning in summer,                                which reaches
its     height        at    the       end        of    summer              or     the      beginning           of
autumn, lasting not rarely                   into winter, and which so far exceeds
the spring maximum, that the latter not unfrequently                                             disappears
altogether, so that there             is   only one minimum, winter and spring, and
one maximum, summer and autumn.                                   In tropical countries, in the
worst malarious districts, the disease                            is   most rife during the rains.
The relation which malaria bears to heat                               is   as follows      — the      greater
the mean summer temperature,                          other things being of course taken
into account, the more malaria, and the amount of malaria decreases
with        the mean       annual temperature                  of the place, ceasing             altogether
with the summer isobar of                             F.       But, as Hirsch says,              " in
                                             60°                                                      higher
latitudes, the malarial               fevers which              have       prevailed endemically or
epidemically in spring undergo for the most part   considerable re                  a
mission on the setting in of summer heat, and they do not revive
until the cooler weather of autumn," and again, " in the         of                               regions

not at the height of summer,             but only when the high temperature
is declining      in late summer and in autumn,               and,   for the tropics
in particular, at the end of the hot season.                   As many        observers
state, this is directly     due   to the great diurnal raDge of temperature
that occurs at that season."
    The influence of rain or moisture has undoubtedly much to do
with both the production and            spread of malaria.         With      regard   to
the rains, we may say that the malarial poison is most                         virulent
either when they set in after a long period of heat, or when the rains
cease and give place to warm, dry weather.                  An endemic outbreak
of malaria, and its epidemic         spread    are both notably diminished at
the height of the rains,        if they   are very abundant, and          it  has been
proved over and over again that the malarial process is developed
more    abundantly in wet than in dry years.                  These remarks hold
good   both as to tropical and temperate                climates.     But it is not
with rainfall    alone that we have to do, for moisture must be present in
the soil in order for the production of malaria, and this saturation
of the ground may be produced in various ways apart from atmo
spheric precipitations.        Drainage from rivers, lakes, and pools, may
constantly saturate       the soil, and so may inundations either periodic
or irregular.        The   irrigation    of   the soil      exerts   an    undoubted
influence on the production of the poison             ;  its effect is very marked
in Egypt, and in        the irrigation districts of India.          Lastly, the soil
may be saturated         by sub-soil water.      This point is of       importance,
because    it explains the      occurrence     of malaria in localities remote
from river basins, and where the soil cannot become saturated                        in
other ways.        The occurrence      of malaria in the Sahara, in Spain,
Greece, Algiers,      Tripolis, and Darfour,       is  in all probability duo        to
this sub-soil water, arising either from springs or in other ways and
resting upon impermeable strata of rock or marl.
   Apart from the moisture in         the soil,  it must     possess other physical
characteristics,     although    the  geological characters        of the country
would appear        to exert little or no influence on the production                or
non-production       of the disease, except in so far as they affect the
physical nature of the soil.           Clay, loam, clayey marl, and marshy
soil are most favourable to the production                  of malaria   ;   a porous
chalky soil is less favourable and sandy soil least so, provided
always that the chalk or sand does not rest either upon clay or firm

  278           Proceedings        of Royal     Society    of Edinburgh.            [sess.
  rock.   The exemption from malaria of some of the islands in the
  West Indies with a chalky soil is remarkable when contrasted with
  its special prevalence in islands of volcanic formation.                 The amount
  of organic material too, contained by the soil is bound up with the
  production      of malaria.       All   other circumstances        being equal,     the
 greatest   amount of malaria will be found                    where the amount of
 organic matter in the soil is greatest, the prevalence                 of  the. disease
 diminishing        as the    organic matter is found in less               abundance.
 Changes    in the soil produced by cultivation, the neglect of cultiva
 tion, and by excavations, also affect                 the presence or absence          of
 malaria,    but     space   forbids     us    entering    into   these  details.      In
 reference    to    marshes,    however,      it may     be noted     in passing that
 malaria will disappear from a marshy district                    if it is completely
 drained and dried, or        if  a marsh is converted into a pool or lake.
     The  amount        of malaria,       as   also   its severity, is affected        by
 altitude and        the  configuration       of the ground.         The   altitude    at
 which malaria can be produced varies in different regions,                        being
 higher in the tropics than in the temperate zones.                   Thus in Central
 Africa   we find      that a height of some 3000 feet must be attained
 before   one     reaches   a    district   free   from malaria, whereas         in the
 Apennines      a  height of 1500 feet only is required, and farther north
 only 500 feet         This, however, must          be explained more by variation
 in  temperature      than by mere altitude.           On the other hand, however,
 examining      the configuration of the ground in plains, it is found
 that the disease is distinctly more virulent                 the lower the level of
 the country.         This fact is   so marked that often even 50 or 100 feet
 less makes a considerable difference             to the salubrity or otherwise of
a given spot.
     Although winds do not exert any direct influence upon the pro
 duction of the malarial poison, they act indirectly, as, for instance,
 by moderating temperature,              &c.     They    act,   however, directly      in
the diffusion of the poison or in preventing it exercising its potent
effects.   "Wind may carry the malarious poison from a marsh to a
healthy district, but it is probable that               it  can only thus convey        it
for a distance of some two or three miles.                     Malaria may rise to a
height of some 700 or 800 feet in a calm atmosphere ; wind will
prevent this vertical diffusion.              Probably on some islands, where
from analogy we should expect to find malaria present, the constant

 winds rapidly changing the atmosphere                 carry away the morbific
 elements     before they have time to do harm.
    Water can convey the malarial             poison, but it is unknown            at
 present     how far it can carry it or how long the poison can remain
 unimpaired when carried either by           a stream    or a current.
    From what has been said, some idea may be obtained of those
 factors requisite for the production of the malarial poison.                It is in
 all probability     due to a micro-organism which            may find entrance
into the body by means of the air, by drinking water and possibly
 also by the consumption of food contaminated by it.                It is certainly
 ponderable, as is proved by the effect of altitude, of barometrical
 pressure,     and by the actiou which winds have in its dissemination.
 It is also  miscible with water.     We may sum up our definite knowledge
 of the disease by saying that it requires for its production a specific
 germ, suitable soil, a certain amount of moisture, a sufficiently high
 temperature,     and  a certain time for development.
    An examination of the        map, bearing what lias been said in view,
 will   I   think show how the          presence    of malaria in the various
 quarters in      which   it exists    is to be accounted        for by physical
 phenomena.

    Definition.   — An infectious, eruptive fever, commencing suddenly,
and characterised by severe pain in the head and eye-balls,                swelling
 and pain in the muscles         and joints, prone to shift suddenly from
joint     to joint,   catarrhal   symptoms,       sore   throat, congested      con
junctiva, and affection of the sub-maxillary glands.                  The disease
 may remit, and is liable to relapse.
    Geographical Distribution.      — Dengue      has been known sinco 1780,
 in which year it attained        a  considerable diffusion       in the tropical
 and sub-tropical parts of both eastern and western hemispheres.                   It

280          Proceedings          of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                        [sess.
is now known to have visited Egypt, Senegambia, and Tripoli, and
the valley of the Nile as far as Khartum                     ; also   Arabia along the
coasts, and Mecca.         It is    epidemic all over India and Further India,
and in Batavia; and has appeared                     in Shanghai, Amoy, and the
island of Formosa.            It   has also    visited Reunion, Tahiti, Zanzibar,
and the Canary Islands            ;   and epidemics have overspread the West
Indies and     a great      part of the Southern States of the Union, as
well as the northern           shores     of South       America.       Space      will not
permit    of indicating        the     various     areas    of diffusion       during      the
several great epidemics of Dengue, but                it must    suffice to state that its
greatest area   of diffusion lies between            33°   N. lat. and      23° 30' S. lat.
    Remarks. — The         period      of incubation        of   Dengue       is probably
about six days.         It   is a   highly infectious disorder, spreading with
extreme rapidity.          Summer and early autumn are undoubtedly the
Dengue season, and the disease appears to depend on                      a  high tempera
ture for its production.               In  the tropics as well          as in the more
tropical zones, nearly all the epidemics of Dengue have been in the
hot weather,    and as soon          as a great    fall of    temperature       takes place
the disease declines rapidly.              It   is probable that the moisture of
the atmosphere        has   little or nothing to do with the production
of Dengue    ;  as a   rule it is chiefly confined to coast districts, to the
courses of great rivers, and to places having a low altitude.                          It  has
been noticed     in various epidemics of Dengue that it                      spreads     in   a
curious way amongst            various      classes    of the     community.           Every
race,   nationality,     age,    and sex       may be attacked by the disease,
although in separate           epidemics a remarkable immunity                     has been
 noticed on the part of certain classes.                  Sometimes Europeans will
be attacked,       and natives          enjoy     comparative       freedom from           the
 disease; again,    in other     cases, natives      will  be almost solely attacked;
 sometimes     children      suffer     more    than adults, or the reverse               may
 obtain.    For instance, Pasque             says,   speaking of the epidemic at
 Benghazi,     that     it   was      noticeable      for    the   decided        immunity
 experienced by the blacks, but they are attacked as much                         as  anyone
 else in Egypt and       Senegal.        Christie remarks that in one or two of
 the epidemics which he witnessed in Zanzibar, the natives suffered
 less than the Europeans.               In   the epidemic in Mauritius              in 1873,
 hardly any children were attacked by the disease.                         In   the Deccan
 epidemic of 1872 there was noticed a peculiar                         predisposition        to

Dengue       in    persons     suffering      from     any    surgical     complaint.         In
Goojerat in 1824, and in Amoy in 1872, it was found that all the
severe    cases    were    limited      to the    native population, that the Euro
peans suffered        to a far less extent, and that those who were attacked
by the disease had it in a remarkably mild form.
   As to the specific nature of Dengue,                     there   can be no doubt, but
whether due to          a   parasite     or not is at present unknown, nor is it
yet ascertained        whether the poison springs up de novo at all points
where its potency is manifested, or whether                     it  is only epidemic at a
few places, and spreads from these                   under favouring         circumstances.
At first Dengue         was not thought            to  be contagious, but          it  is both
infectious and highly contagious, and the diffusion                         of the disease
could be traced in the epidemic of 1871-73, in the East from port
to port, and from country to country along tho highways                               of land
and water traffic.          One attack of Dengue does not confer absolute
immunity        from      subsequent          attacks,     although     it  does     so   to   a
certain extent.

   Sijnon. — Serous Cholera; Spasmodic Cholera; Malignant Cholera;
Fr. Cholera asiatique          ;   Ger. Asiatische Cholera.
   Definition. — Asiatic cholera is a specific disease, characterised by
violent vomiting,            rice-water         evacuations, cramps,             prostration,
collapse,     and other striking symptoms                 ;  tending    to run a rapidly
fatal course     ;  and capable of being communicated to persons other
wise   in sound health, through the dejecta of patients suffering from
the disease.
    Geographical        Distribution. — With regard               to the    distribution      of
cholera,    it is not advisable            to   proceed     on exactly the same lines
as  with other diseases,           for,   although the epidemic area of cholera
is very    vast,     its endemic area is very limited.                    It will     be well
therefore,     in the first        place,    to   specify those regions which have
hitherto     escaped      the     ravages     of the disease,         next    to   define    its
endemic area, and finally to make                    some general       remarks      as  to its
pandemic diffusion.              A   glance at the map         will render this division
clear.
   Up    to the present          time, Australia and the           islands of the Pacific

282            Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                    [sess.
Ocean have remained unaffected by the disease.                     So too has the
whole    of Africa, with the exception               of   a  strip    of   coast-land
commencing at Delagoa Bay and running all round the eastern and
northern coasts of the Continent as far as lat.             1 4°  N.     The islands
of St Helena and Ascension have also escaped.                  In South America,
Terra del Fuego, Patagonia, Chili, the higher slopes                  of the Andes
and the Falkland Islands           have been hitherto exempt.               In North
America, the whole of the country north of 50° N. lat. has remained
free   from     cholera,   as well    as the     highest slopes      of the Rocky
Mountains       and the Bermudas.           Greenland and Iceland            have not
been visited by the disease.
    In Europe,      we find     that the Farce Islands,         the Hebrides, the
Shetlands       and Orkneys,      Lapland,     the Russian territory         north of
 the  64th parallel, Switzerland,        and the northern part of Scotland
have escaped.
    In Asia, the northern districts of Siberia and Kamtschatka                    have
remained free,      as also  probably Mongolia        and Manchuria.           We   see
from these exceptions, what an immense area of the earth's surface
 has been visited from time to time by the terrible scourge of cholera.
 It must be    remembered,     however, that, although the area of distribu
tion of cholera has been           so vast, yet certain isolated districts           in
the various countries visited by         it  have remained unaffected.             For
instance, some mountainous districts in the south-west of France,
the south-west of Germany, notably                Baden and Wurtemburg, and
the greater part of Greece.
    Even in India itself there            are   places    where    its ravages      are
 unknown     ;   for instance,   it has not attacked        the hilly regions of
Bengal, but the reason for this is apparently to be found in the
fact that the hill men have little or no communication with indi
viduals from the affected          area.    Should     they descend       from their
mountains, or have any communication with the inhabitants of the
plain, they suffer from the disease very severely.
    With    regard    to the home        of   cholera,    we must       define   it  as
situated in the delta and valley of the Ganges,              from which point it
receives an impulse which enables           it at times to become pandemic           in
character.       There can be no doubt that cholera existed long before
 1817;    of its previous epidemic spread              no very certain informa
tion can be given, but that it overspread                India and the adjacent

  1888-89.]         Dr R. W. Felkin         on Tropical Diseases.                 283
  countries is certain.        It   appears   to bo equally certain that, apart
  from the original impetus given to cholera              in  1817, the commerce
  of the world      has been the means of spreading          it over such   a  world
  wide area    as  indicated on the map.
     The first pandemic, of which            we have authentic       data,  occurred
  during the years 1817-1823, in which period the disease devastated
  an area from Nagasaki, 147°            K,   to the coast of Syria, 52"     £., and
  from Bourbon, 21° S., to Astrakan, 46° 21' N.
     The second pandemic, which took place during the years 1826-
  1837, overspread nearly the whole of the countries                marked on the
 map as being affected by cholera.              From 1837-1816 Europe, Africa,
  and America were free from further outbreaks of the disease.
     The    third    great    pandemic     occurred from      1848-1863,      with   a
  remission,   as   far   as the   eastern  hemisphere     is concerned,    between
  1850    and 1852      ;  and during this pandemic it visited the whole of
  the northern hemisphere, and reached lat. 25° S. in the            Old world    and
  30° S.  in the New.
     The fourth pandemic occurred during the years                   1865-75,     and
 is noticeable for the rapidity           with which cholera       was introduced
 into Europe        by sea from        the coast     of Arabia.     In the former
 pandemics it had always come from the east by way of Afghanistan,
 Persia, and Asiatic Russia.            From 1875 until the limited outbreak
 in 1883, when cholera appeared              in Italy, Spain, and     the south    of
 France from Egypt, the disease has been confined to Asiatic                     soil,
and    in  the year mentioned the spread             of cholera was very strictly
limited.
     Remarks. — Before referring briefly to some points in the origin
and spread        of cholera,     it may    be well to remark       that, however
the disease      is produced, the researches          of Koch, which have been
very recently confirmed by Drs Milles and Macleod, who investigated
the subject in 1875 at Shanghai, and an abstract of whose researches
was read before the Royal            Society of Edinburgh on Dec. 17, 1888,
have almost definitely proved that the comma bacillus                  has a causal
relation to cholera.          This bacillus      is constantly present    in Asiatic
cholera,     and    it  has   never been       found anywhere but        in Asiatic
cholera.      Granting, as we think we are right in doing, that cholera
is produced by a morbific microbe,              we must next refer to various
facts    with   regard     to the    conditions    necessary   for an epidemic of

284                Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                    [sess.
cholera to arise.            Cholera may be introduced                into  a  given area,
and yet it does not necessarily follow that it                        will thrive in that
area, and some definite local condition                  must exist for its propaga
tion.     With       regard to the influence of altitude,            it may   be said that,
although cholera can penetrate                 to a considerable height, yet, unless
in very severe epidemics, the number of cases are fewer the higher it
ascends      ;  and Farr adduced the law, that " the proportion of deaths
among the inhabitants              from cholera is inversely           as the elevation of
the ground."            This law holds       good, not only       in high altitudes, but
in slight elevations in very limited areas.                   Ackland,     writiug on     the
mortality        from cholera, mentioned the fact that in three epidemics
of cholera in Oxford,               in 1832,       1849,   and      1854,   the mortality
per thousand             people,   living     at a mean      height      of 30 feet above
water-level, was respectively 3-3                  and   1*8,    as  compared     with    9 8
and    5 "3     deaths     per thousand which          occurred amongst the people
living in         the    low-lying    part of the town.             There   are,  however,
exceptions to this rule,             as   in  some epidemics          hilly districts   have
suffered       more than the lower-lying surrounding                 country.
     Again, cholera follows the course of rivers, this probably being
 due to the fact that the               riparian areas possess soil saturated with
water and decaying organic matter.                     There can be no doubt, too,
that cholera spreads most rapidly in countries having an alluvial or
 tertiary soil.
     With      reference to the influence of weather on cholera,                  we know
 that the disease is met with under every known variety of climate                            ;
 yet doubtless         a  high temperature aids its spread, and most epidemics
 are brought         to an end, or at least          are most       markedly reduced        in
 extent, when the temperature falls greatly.                        The Vienna Confer
 ence of 1884, in which were assembled                    representatives of all coun
 tries, stated that there were no facts to show that atmospheric causes
 alone could bring on cholera, and also, that all facts go to show
 that in free air the generative principle                     of cholera rapidly       loses
 its morbific character.
     With      regard to the influence of the moisture of the atmosphere
 upon the production             or spread      of cholera,     it would    appear    that   a
 certain amount of moisture in                   the atmosphere,         or perhaps moie
 correctly speaking,          in  the soil, is needed         for its development and
 spread    ;    it  is    probable    that     spring   showers or sudden summer

rains   will give to cholera                 an impetus, whereas continuous rains, by
completely        saturating           the     soil, prevent     its occurrence.        No   one
knows the cause which gives                       it epidemic impulse, but          we    know
that,   generally            speaking,        cholera     becomes     epidemic during         the
intensely hot weather following heavy rains.
   The wind may have a certain action on the spread                                of cholera,
always provided that                   it   be a moist wind,          but the old idea that
winds could convey cholera poison for long distances seems now to
be obsolete. But indirectly the south-west monsoon certainly aids
in spreading cholera, because it brings with it moisture which is
necessary for its propagation, and because numbers of vessels                                take
advantage of this monsoon to sail from the endemic area of cholera
to other places.             As Macnamara justly remarks, " cholera thus pro
gresses with man along the great high-roads upon which                             ho travels,
spreading no faster than he moves, and being generated by wet, hot
weather."  Although the disease is thus indirectly spread by the
south-west monsoon, it must not be concluded that it cannot travel
against wind, for it travels just                  as   fast against the wind      as   with it.
Water       is   capable         of disseminating          cholera germs after they have
been produced            in the soil, or after it          has been contaminated by the
discharges       of cholera patients.
   The great factor in the distribution                      of cholera is certainly that
of human intercourse.                  Persons suffering from the disease, though it
may be only        in   a latent form, undoubtedly convey the poison for long
distances,       and it is         a   well known         fact that troops,     pilgrims, and
emigrants have spread                  it far and wide.          It   is necessary, however,
for an epidemic of cholera to arise, that the poison conveyed into
a district should find there a fitting soil for its growth.                        What that
fitting soil     is,   it   is   impossible yet to say.

                       — A pestilential contagious fever of                a   continuous and
special type.           It   presents two well-defined stages.             The first extends
from 36 to 150 hours, and                        is     marked   by rapid circulation        and

 elevated     temperature.             The second      is characterised                   by depression
 of the nervous and muscular powers, and of the circulation, with
 slow and often intermittent pulse; jaundice;                               suppression of urine,
 albuminuria, and desquamation of the renal epithelium                                        ;   diminution
 of the fibrin of the blood, capillary congestion, passive haemorrhages
 from the mucous surfaces and black vomit                         ;    fatty degeneration of the
 heart and liver      ;   and convulsions, delirium and coma.                                 As    a general
 rule, it occurs but once during life.
       Geographical Distribution.            — Although           yellow fever extends over
 the areas mentioned below, it must be noticed that there are only
 three     districts where         it is really      endemic,            i.e., (a) in the West
 Indies, especially in the Greater Antilles                   ;       (b) on the Mexican part
 of the Gulf Coast         ;    and (c) on the Guinea coast at Sierra Leone.
     The area of distribution          of yellow fever is at present limited in
Africa     to the west coast from              19°    N.    to a point on the mainland
opposite     Fernando Po.              In   the Western Hemisphere                       it   occurs along
the eastern shores             of the United States from lat.                             38°       N., and,
skirting the coast round the Gulf of Mexico                                and Central America,
it   passes along the northern coast of South America and the eastern
coast as far as 32° S.                 On the western             shores       of South America
yellow fever has appeared                 in epidemics from                5° S. to 42° S.              It     is
also prevalent throughout the whole of the West Indies.                                            Although
in the United States and South                        America yellow                      fever chiefly
infests     the coast          regions,     exception must be made to the great
rivers, such as the Mississippi, the Amazon, and the Rio de la Plata,
for it extends up         these rivers to varying distances.                         In       the western
hemisphere the yellow fever area is bounded                                    on    the north               by
44° 39'    N. (Halifax), and on the south by                          34° 54' (Monte                 Video);
in the     eastern    hemisphere by 43° 34' N. (Leghorn), and 8° 48' S.
(Ascension);     these are its extreme limits.
     Remarks. — There            are some curious facts                with regard                 to yellow
fever and its relation to climate which                    it is      necessary to remember.
Firstly,    Negroes are congenitally                  exempt from                   it,       unless    they
leave    the tropics for           any length        of time and then                             return;     if
they do this their             immunity       seems    to be           lost.        It    appears,          too,
that Mongolians           escape yellow         fever.       All           other races, however,
suffer from    it,   and   it    is   noteworthy that the further north from its
area   a   person was born the more likely                            is   he to suffer from                  it,

should he come within reach of an epidemic.                                             New arrivals             are
most exposed to this disease                    ;    should they escape it at first they are
the less liable to suffer from                      it,   the longer they reside               in   one place     ;
but    if   they travel about, this acclimatisation                                  appears        to be lost.
Whatever may be the real cause of yellow fever, its origin seems
to be connected with              heat, for although                    it     occurs    in sporadic and
epidemic forms at all seasons in the tropical part of the yellow fever
zone, the disease        is      greatest, and takes an epidemic spread                                    at the
hottest period of the year,                  a        temperature of at least 70° F. being
required for its production.                        Frost puts             an end to an epidemic at
once, and storms,           heavy rains, or cold weather check its progress.
Although heavy rainfall will                        stay an epidemic, yet moisture                         in    the
atmosphere          would seem to be necessary for the production                                          of the
poison,     for in dry years or during seasons of long-continued drought
the number           of yellow             fever cases are                  always       remarkably             few.
Winds influence yellow fever by their                                  effect upon the atmosphere,
but    it   does     not appear            that they are capable                        of conveying             the
poison,      at least to any distance.                       On looking at the chart,                      it   will
at once be seen that yellow fever                           is   most prevalent on the                   sea coast
and along the courses of the great rivers                                  ;   it   always spreads              from
centres       of dense        population,                 and the greatest               number          of     cases
occur in the dirtiest and most overcrowded parts of largo towns.
Altitude, certainly,              has      an important influence on the spread of
yellow fever, and           it   is    only in very severe epidemics that                                it   leaves
 the      plains.     The     protection                  which       altitude       confers        against the
disease      is   almost certainly due to the lower temperature                                     of elevated
spots,      because     where yellow                       fever has made               its appearance             in
highly       situated regions,             it   has always been                     in localities noted for
 the exceptional heat of the days.
      A   certain saturation of the atmosphere                              is   an essential            condition
 for an epidemic of yellow fever.                                It   is   probable that            it   does not
 occur      until   a   high      dew-point, the                   minimum              being       upwards        of
 74,      exists, and       it    is       certain          that      epidemics          cease      before       the
 dew-point          descends          to    58.            The     geological           characters         of    the
 soil have apparently nothing to do with the production of yellow
 fever, and all those conditions of soil which wo found to be necessary
for the production of the malarial poison, exert no influence in pro
ducing        yellow fever.             Electricity              has    a      curious     influence            upon

  persons suffering from the disease, even should they be almost con
 valescent.      It   is said that should        a   thunderstorm      occur, severe
 symptoms are immediately manifested in persons suffering from the
 disease, or a relapse occurs       in the apparently convalescent.
     Yellow fever poison clings         to the ground, and its diffusion may
 be   barred by streams,          walls, and, some        say,  by much travelled
 thoroughfares,       and  it  does    not appear       that the water-supply         of
 cities aids its spread.      Its period of incubation is variable, and may
 be said   to be between twenty hoars and several weeks                 ; this varies
 in different    epidemics,    and the most common period of incubation
 is from twenty to one hundred hours.
    Preventive      inoculations are now being largely practised against
 yellow fever with very great success, and there seems to be every
 reason   to hope that at last a method of preventing               the disease    will
be firmly established, although up to the present its true origin has
 escaped scientific inquiry.
    The disease may be spread             by   fomites,       and its  toxic    power
 retained for very long periods.

the Indus from the Punjaub              southwards through Scinde              as   far  as
Goojerat and the        Gulf of Cambay, and        to the east through Bajpootana
and the North- West Provinces               as  far   as Delhi, Meerut, Lucknow,
ami Gwalior.
     Remarks. — Objection may be taken by some to classing under
 one heading a sore having so many names, but it seems to me that,
 taking      all things into consideration, the various designations all
 refer to one and the same disease, and that their different features
 are simply        modifications produced by varieties of climate                 ;   their
 various manifestations are also most probably, to some extent at
 least, influenced by racial characteristics and by the habits of the
 patients     attacked.      In each locality where         these   sores obtain, they
 vary considerably in their            appearance       with the character        of    the
 season.       Two theories have been, and still           are,  advanced    as to    their
 cause, some authorities         considering that they are          a  local manifesta
  tion of   a cachectic    condition due to    a residence     in unhealthy localities
  or   badly     drained towns in certain parts of the tropics.                     Others
  again,    and notably Carter, consider that the disease is distinctly
  due to a parasite, and this view is supported by cogent facts.                    Carter
 has    found in the sores spheroids and mycelium                    ;   the  disease     is
 localised,     and this fact is against it being the outward manifestation
 of   a constitutional state.        The disease can be innoculated, and it is
 contagious.         Again, many facts lead one to suppose that the parasite
 is introduced into         the body, either during          ablution    or by the bito
 of some insect

 characters    of the soil, nor has         altitude   anything     to do    with its
 production.       With   regard     to water, however,       it may     he that we
 should consider it       as   a cause,    for there are     instances     on record
 where a change        of the source of the water supply has exerted a
 marked influence upon the number of cases seen.                   When, however,
 we come to inquire       as to what substance          in the water produces or
 might produce the disease, we are met by various statements                   which
 are contradictory, or at any rate give no certain clue on which to
 base a definite opinion.           For instance, the gypsum found in the
 water at Aleppo is      given as a cause : the abundance of nitrates in
the water of the Punjaub,           or the presence of sulphurated hydrogen
due to putrefying       matters,    is blamed.      Hard water is      suspected   by
others, and     in Algiers    the excessive     amount of choride of sodium is
considered suspicious       ;  lastly, the amount of earthy salts contained
in  some waters is said to cause the sore.             But there    are many other
observations which cause grave doubts as to the correctness                   of any
of these views.
    Meteorological     conditions      must, we believe,      exert a not incon
siderable power in the production of Oriental                   sores.    It will  be
noticed that the distribution          of the disease is over arid regions, but
in  these   regions it is strictly localised to various foci.            In the sub
tropical regions the disease makes its appearance              in the late autumn,
and it is met with in the winter in the tropical zone.                  Where it is
found at    all  seasons of the year, the climate is characterised by hot,
dry air during the day, sometimes              heavy dew at night, and rapid
fluctuations of the thermometer.            It must,   however, be remembered,
that in some places the Oriental              sore attacks      its victims in the
season of the year when vital             powers   are lowest.      It is important
not to mistake phagedaenic             tropical   ulcers for the Oriental       sore,
as the   former are due to constitutional           debility, induced either by
amemia,     malaria, scurvy, fatigue or want, in persons residing or
travelling    in swampy regions, where the               atmosphere     is hot and
moist.

    Geographical Distribution.           — Tho distoma          has, so far as we know,
a  peculiar and very limited              area of      distribution.       It  is found    in
Mauritius,     where the       disease    it   causes was first described           in 1812
by Chanotin.          It  is strictly limited        to the delta of the        Nile  and to
various points of the White Nile between                         6°  X. and the Albert
Nyanza,        It  is   also   indigenous at the Cape,               where it is strictly
confined     to the     coast territory       and to the banks of streams for                a
distance     of some        10   or   20   miles from the           sea.    Its chief    seat
is in tho south-eastern            districts of Cape Colony near Algoa Buy,
especially    at TJitenhage and           Port Elizabeth,         the neighbourhood of
 King William's town            and East London             in Kaffraria,    as  well   as at
 several places in Natal; for example, on the banks of tho Umlasi, the
 Ungeni between port Natal and Pietermaritzburg, and the Umhloti.
 It is probably also found in various other places                    in Central Africa.
    Remarks. — A knowledge of the geographical distribution of this
 parasite is of great importance,            because, by taking proper precautions
 when residing in its limited area of production, it is possible                            to
 escape its ravages.          There can be no doubt that it exists in stagnant
 pools, in the shallow water of declining rivers,                      near estuaries, and
 at the sea coast.         It is affected     by season, being found in the water
 in  tho summer,       and    it is during       the summer         too that most people
 are affected by the disease.             It    is curious to notice its preference
 for the male sex, and it is most commonly seen in them between
 the ages of five and thirty-five                 years.     At Pietermaritzburg          the
 majority     of    youths      are    affected      by the parasite.            As it    can
 only obtain entrance           into the body by means of drinking water
 or  in bathing,       the    necessary      precautions should            be   taken,    and
 Europeans        who    may      contract       the   disease      should     immediately
 remove from the infected area.

     Definition.     —A      disease        characterised          by anaemia,             anasarca,       de
generation of muscular tissue,                     effusion      into the serous cavities,                 de
bility,      numbness,       pain and paralysis of the extremities, especially
the     lower;      precordial        anxiety, pain,          and dyspnoea,            and in          some
cases drowsiness or sleepiness.                        Beri-beri     occurs      in    a    chronic and
an acute form.
     Geograpli      iral Distribution. — Beri-beri, like other similar                           diseases,
has a wide distribution                 in many countries situated in the tropical
and     sub-tropical zones, but, although its area of distribution                                     is so
extensive, it is strictly limited in its endemicity.                             It    is to be found
both in           the eastern      and western             hemispheres.           Looking at the
eastern hemisphere               first, we find that one of its chief habitats is in
Japan.            There it was limited,                until fifty      years    ago, to the coast
towns,       but since      that time it has been met with practically all over
the islands.           In China it          is not so frequently seen now as                      it    used
to     be,    but it is endemic               in Burmah,         in Singapore, and in the
Calabash islands.                In   the     Malay       Archipelago,          we find that most
of the islands are endemically affected, especially Sumatra,                                          Banka,
Borneo, Labuan, Celebes, and some of the Molucca group of islands.
We      meet with          it,   too, on the west           coast of New              Guinea, and on
the extreme           east of Java, as well as                in the prisons of Batavia in
Passuruan and Samarang.                       With       regard to India,         Beri-beri infests
a    strip of country, 100 miles broad, on the coast from Grandjam to
Masulipatani,           while      it    is     more      rare     on    the     Coromandel                and
Malabar coasts, and in the plain of the Carnatie.                                      It   is   also met
with      at various isolated           spots     in   the provinces of Decca and Assam,
and     it    is    seen    occasionally          in Calcutta.           It     exists in         Ceylon,
especially         at Trincomalee           and    Candy.        As      an epidemic,            it   is   met
 with in Mauritius, Reunion, Nossi Be, Zanzibar, and probably on
the     Congo.         Passing to the western hemisphere,                       we find that Beri
 beri has been undoubtedly imported from the east.                                    Thus, at various
 times       it   has been       epidemic in Guadaloupe, Cuba, Cayenne,                                Para
guay,        and    Sau Francisco.              Beri-beri may be said                  to be endemic
 over the greater part of Brazil, where                       it    commenced              in the Bahia
 Province, and         it   is   also met     with in Guiana.             It    must be mentioned,
 too,     that Beri-beri often breaks out on board ship, especially in
transports, coolie ships, and vessels trading in the Malay Archipelago,
Bay of Bengal, and with Japan.

     Remarks. — Many have been the theories                                 started         to explain       the
cause of Beri-beri, but, owing                        to the limited          well-defined areas in
which      the disease is endemic,                      most        of them        are unsatisfactory.
Its epidemic            spread,      however, is probably influenced by climate,
and     seems          to    coincide          with     conditions           of    high         atmospheric
moisture      and extreme thermometric variations.                                 Some parasite           will,
doubtless, ere long, be proved to be the real cause of the disease, and
it   is probable that its production                         will   be traced to the soil, for in
those places           where Beri-beri is endemic                       the soil abounds in saline
materials,        such as magnesia,                   lime,     chlorides, alumina, and iron.
Although          all races and persons                 of all ages are attacked by Beri
beri,    the dark races suffer                   most,       and adult            men       far more than
women and children.                      Indeed, so great is the disproportion between
male and female sufferers,                     that the cases seen in women                          are about
one     to thirty-one           in       men.      Although it              is,   as    a    rule,    rare for
children under fifteen to bo attacked by Beri-beri, yet there are
epidemics         on record in which children seem to have suffered                                        most.
Whatever          be the cause of Beri-beri,                        a   residence       of   l   ight or ten
months in an endemic area appears to be necessary before                                              a   person
can be        attacked by            it,   and   it     is    also      a   remarkable fact that              it
attacks       by preference              persons      in an         apparently         robust condition
according to some authorities, others think debility                                        a   predisposing
cause.

     In Africa its           area   is   distinctly      limited to the northern coast belt,

sometimes          occur in Turkey.                In Asia, epidemics of                   plague arise in
Syria,    Caucasia,          Mesopotamia, and Persia                      ; also      in Arabia, on the
coasts,       and      inland       as     far     as    Mecca.       Epidemics                 have visited
Hindostan,            and     there        are      endemic centres                  of    plague         on the
southern           slopes    of the Himalaya,                 in    the       provinces             of   Kumaon
and Gharwal             and in Peshawur.                      It   is probably endemic in the
mountain valleys of Yunnan in China, and in Burmah.
  Description.          — In recent outbreaks of plague, three varieties
have      been        described — (a) Abortive or larval plague; (b) Plague
proper    ;     (c)   Fulminant          plague.         The usual characters of plague may
be rapidly            summed up as follows                : — After       a    day or two's lassitude,
shivering, and vomiting of                 a     black material, high fever                    is   experienced,
with great pain in the axillary and inguinal                                   regions, where buboes
soon form.             Often, too, the body assumes                       a   livid       hue, which           gave
plague        the name        of     "black             death."     The aspect              of the plague
patient       is   peculiar   ;    the face      is     haggard, the eyes retracted,                     and the
conjunctivae red.
   Remarks. — In considering the causes of plague, there can be no
doubt         that     the influence             of the seasons               is     very marked.              The
disease        commences           to     make its            appearance           in the winter, and
cases     become            more    numerous as spring                        sets    in   ;    but      extreme
heat or extreme              cold usually puts an end to an epidemic.                                         It   is
probable that plague                    has no relation to soil,                     and with regard to
altitude, moderately high situations are more prone to be affected
by the disease than are low-lying places, although from this                                             it   must
not be understood that plains                             escape.     There           can be no doubt,
however, that want, filth, and overcrowding are necessary                                                  to the
production of plague, and                   it    is     well known that hygienic measures
both prevent its appearance and stop its epidemic progress.                                               In   con
clusion,      it     may be noted that the closer the association of healthy
people     with       the sick the more liable are they to contract the disease;
hence,        persons       residing       in the          same     house          with plague-stricken
patients are much more likely to be attacked than others, and cloth
ing and bedding may carry the infection.

     Definition.
                 —A    specific    febrile disease, characterised,         by consider
 able   nervous    prostration       and inflammation           of   the   solitary   and
 tubular glands of the large           intestine, sometimes          ending in resolu
 tion, but frequently terminating in ulceration, occasionally in more
 or less sloughing       or gangrene; always accompanied                    by tormina
 and tenesmus.
     Geographical    Distribution.      — The distribution          of tropical dysen
 tery is very wide, and to        a great    extent coincides with the area in
 which malaria      is endemic.            Commencing        with its     existence    on
 the west coast of     Africa,     we    find that it is extremely prevalent in
 Senegambia,     on the    Sierra Leone coast, in Upper                Guinea, and on
 the Gold and Slave coasts,           as   well as throughout         the area watered
 by the Niger.       In all     these     regions   it  affects    natives   as  well  as
 Europeans.      It is not so frequently met with in the Cameroons,                  and
 from thence southward to Cape Lopez it is also less frequent.                     From
 Cape Lopez along the Congo coast endemic areas of dysentery are
 only   to   be  found    in isolated        spots.    Fernando        Po   is  severely
affected    by this disease,      as   are   also   the islands of St lago and
Xicolao.      In Madeira it      is only epidemic.          Passing on to the Cape
of Good Hope, we again meet with a wide area of its distribution,
the natives being especially allbcted             by it   ;  but it is to be noted
that the disease is more severe in the interior of the country than at
the coast.      On the east coast of            Africa dysentery is         endemic    at
Mozambique, Madagascar,            Reunion, and Mauritius; also             at Zanzibar
and along the adjacent coast, but it is much less severe in Mayotte,
Nossi Bti, and St Marie.            It  is very prevalent all over Abyssinia,
except in the dry open tablelands, and it is met with throughout
the whole of the southern Soudan and Nubia; it also passes down
the valley of the Nile to the Delta.                It is endemic in Algiers        and
along the coast regions of Morocco, Tunis, and Tripoli.
    In Asia   dysentery is met with in the valleys of Syria, in the plain
of Mesopotamia, and in many parts of Persia, but it is most severe on
the western and southern coasts of Arabia.                  It  is found in the deep
mountain valleys of Beloochistan and Afghanistan,                      and throughout

all India, being least severe in the Presidency of Bombay.                                               It   occurs
in Ceylon, in Further India, in most of the islands of the Malay
Archipelago, and on the southern and eastern coast zones of China,
In the islands of the Japanese Empire the disease is only epidemic.
  In Australia dysentery is endemic only on the west coast,
although           it        occurs        in slight       epidemics in              Melbourne,           Sydney,
Tasmania, and New Zealand.                                 Endemic dysentery is also met with
in New Caledonia, the                       Fiji Islands, Tahiti,            the Mangareva group, and
in the Hawaiian Islands.
     Passing            to    the western                hemisphere,         we       find    that in         South
America dysentery is                         endemic           in French        and Dutch Guiana, in
Brazil, especially on the coast of the provinces of Maranhao, Piauhy,
and Parahiba, and                     in    the northern and central parts of the country.
It   is seen in Paraguay and on the coast of the Argentine                                               Republic,
as   well     as   in the Provinces of Tucuman                               and Salta.            The coast of
Chili     is also infested by dysentery, and the disease extends north
wards along the coast of Peru; it                                 is,   however, most severe in the
forest region                 on      the    eastern        slopes      of      the Cordillera,            on the
Peruvian Pampas, and in the marshy country bordering the Amazon.
This      area ends at the coast-line of Ecuador, Granada, and Venezuela.
     Dysentery               is   also endemic           in Central America;                 that   is   to say,     in
Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, the Mosquito                                           shore, San Salvador,
Guatemala, and Mexico.                              It    is   found       all over      Mexico          until      the
Anahuac Plateau                     is   reached.         In the West Indian islands, Cuba and
Hayti       are its principal                seats, Jamaica             being less subject to                 it,   and
it   is   probably met with in the other islands.
     With      regard             to the     United        States       of America,          it    is   difficult to
say where the disease                       is   endemic,       but   it   occurs more or less all over
the States,              including           California,        and     is   most      frequent along the
Atlantic and                  the     Gulf    coasts.          In British North America, Prince
Edward Island and Vancouver Island are affected.
     In Europe,               endemic         dysentery         is   confined to        a    few spots chiefly
in the southern peninsulas and islands.                                    It   is   common        in Andalusia,
on the tableland of Estremadura and                                     New Castile, in Aragon, and
in    the     southern parts of Galicia                          and Catalonia.               It    is   prevalent
throughout               Italy, especially in the southern provinces and in
Sicily    ;   also       in Malta. It      found in Greece in the Peloponnese,

endemic           in some parts of Guyenne and Provence, in Lyonaise and
Auvergne, in          a     few valleys of the Yosges, in the marshy districts of
the Brenne, and in Sologne and Guer.                                     In Sweden it is probably
endemic at Jonkoping,                     Skaraborg, Elfsborg,                  'Wermland,          Guteborg,
and Bohus, and in the island of Gottland.                                          In Russia it casually
occurs       in    the Baltic        Provinces,           but more especially in Trans-Cau
casia.
     Remarks. — That endemic dysentery is due to some microbe,                                              there
can bo        little or       no     doubt      ;    at least      the        researches       of Prior and
Cartullis almost definitely prove it.                             It    is,   however, difficult to say
with exactitude what gives rise to the morbific microbe.                                            Although,
as above          stated,    endemic        dysentery occupies                     very nearly the same
geographical          distribution          as       malaria,          yet    it    has    some     points of
difference.          For     instance,         its endemic              spread       can    proceed        to    far
higher latitudes than does malaria.
     Various        facts     prove that the disease                     is     influenced by climate,
for   it     is   endemic at all            seasons             in hot        tropical     regions,     and       it
is    also    found       that      in    more       temperate          latitudes outbursts of the
disease       occur chiefly,             one        might almost say                 solely,      during         the
late summer and               early autumn season.                       Extreme cold puts an end
to    epidemic dysentery just                        as   it    does    to yellow          fever.      All this
shows that heat              is   necessary         for its production.               But, again, we find
that fluctuations in temperature                          exert   a    marked influence in its pro
duction and spread.                      Where           hot days and cold nights obtain in
tropical regions             dysentery          is   most       prevalent.           This fact        has been
observed           again and          again         in    various wars,             as,    for instance,          in
Ashantee, Abyssinia,                 China, and more recently still in the Soudan.
In Sweden the                 disease      rarely attains any                    considerable epidemic
diffusion, unless             the summer has been remarkable for great                                     heat    ;
and even           the severe       epidemics confined to limited portions of the
country mostly coincide with extremely hot summer weather.                                                        It
is   difficult to decide            what influence the moisture in the atmosphere
has upon the production                     of dysentery, as authorities                          differ        very
much on this point, but we cannot help believing that moisture does
play   a     part in either the production                        of the disease or in predispos
ing persons           to suffer          from       it,   and    that marshy districts and the
neighbourhood of large rivers where morning fogs are of frequent
occurrence,         are certainly injurious,                    even    if     the moisture itself does

 not   aid in producing     the dysenteric poison.                It   may,     of course,
 be that swampy districts exert their             influence more indirectly than
 directly,   for, doubtless, malaria         does     predispose         individuals        to
 attacks of dysentery, and the marshes may give rise to malaria which
 is only too often followed by intestinal            disease.      It    has been stated
 by Annersley that dysentery rages in Bengal in the rainy season,
 and it is well known      that the disease is most prevalent in lower
 Egypt   at the time of the overflow of the              Nile.        It  does not seem
 that elevation or configuration          of the ground, nor the geological
 formation or the physical characters of the soil, have any connection
 with the production of dysentery.
    Although, as we have just remarked, malaria may predispose to
 dysentery, we do not find, in considering the geographical distribu
 tion of the two diseases, that the points in which they are severally
 most   virulent   coincide, which one would              naturally        expect to be
 the case were the diseases           produced       by the same            factors,    or  if
 they had a very intimate relation the one to the other.
    It  can only be said,      in conclusion, that contaminated drinking
 water may frequently serve to introduce the virus of dysentery into
 the system, and that it appears to be proved that                  a  person suffering
from the disease may introduce             it into    a previously         healthy com
munity.

     Geographical Distribution.                      — Leprosy            is   endemic at the present
time in Egypt, and throughout the whole of the basin of the 'Silo,
as    well   as   on the shores of the Mediterranean and Eed Seas.                                            It   is
very prevalent in Abyssinia,                             on the coast, on the plains, and in
the    hill districts.        It        is     also      endemic at Zanzibar,                  Mozambique,
Madagascar,           St Marie, Mauritius,                    Reunion, St Helena, in the Canary
Islands, and on the west side of the island of Madeira.                                           It    is    met
with in Algiers and Morocco, but is rarely seen in the Azores, and
Tripoli and Tunis are said to                         be free from it.            On the west coast of
Africa leprosy is endemic in                         a   very extensive area, extending from
Senegambia to Cape Lopez.                             In this region it exists all over                      Sene-
gambia and Sierra Leone;                       it   overspreads           the districts watered         by the
Niger and the Binue,               as    well       as the      whole of the Cameroons district.
Leprosy is not met with on the Loango coast, and Angola                                           as    well       as
the Congo are free from                      it,   as also     is   the province of Natal, but                it   is
endemic to         a   considerable extent at the                              Cape    and in Zululand.

                           it           is    to be noticed that                India and        the eastern
parts of Asia are the most affected.                                In Nearer Asia            the disease          is
endemic in        a   few limited areas; e.g., on the southern coast of Arabia,
especially at Muscat,              as    well       as   in the centre of the                country.         The
mountainous districts of Persia, Syria, and Cyprus                                       are affected,             as
are also some parts           of Turkestan,                    especially Samaracand,              Miankal,
and Hissar.  In Asia Minor      now only endemic in isolated spots
                                                    it   is
— at Smyrna, in the neighbourhood of Sinope, and on the shores of
the Black Sea.           It   is   met        with all over India, but                  is   least prevalent
in   the Madras Presidency.                         The disease         is   fairly   common     in Ceylon,
but chiefly on the south and south-western coasts, and endemic areas
are found         in British Burmah, in                   the peninsula of Malacca, in Siam,
and Cochin-China.              In       the East         Indian Archipelago             the most import
ant areas of endemic leprosy are on the west coast of Java and in its
mountainous regions,               the        disease being more rarely met with on the
southern and eastern coasts.                          Leprosy        is   also endemic in the Anda-
mans and Nicobars, in the elevated and inland regions of Sumatra, on
the west coast         of Borneo, in                  Celebes        (province        of Menehasse), in
Flores, in the interior of Timor, in Banda, and in the Philippines.                                            In
the Chinese Empire the areas of endemic leprosy are chiefly confined
to the southern          and eastern coasts                    ;   it   is     rarely met with in the

interior, except towards the northern part of the empire.                      In Japan
leprosy is very prevalent, only the Loo-Choo Islands being free from
it.    It   exists   in New Zealand, in the Hawaiian                 group, and some
times in Tahiti.
    In Europe leprosy only           occurs endemically, in small and, for the
most     part, clearly defined         areas ;    in Spain it    is  confined to the
provinces of Catalonia, Andalusia, Galicia, Asturia,                     and Granada.
In Portugal it      is met with in the provinces of Beira, Estremadura, and
Algarve.        In Italy it    is endemic in two places        — viz.,  at the Eiviera-
di-Ponete and at Comacchio.                 It  is also found      in Sicily.      In   the
Balkan Peninsula leprosy still exists in small centres on the coast of
the    Ejalet of Salonica (Thessaly and Macedonia), and                    a   few    cases
occur in Constantinople,           which are probably imported.               In    Greece
it  is sometimes       seen in the neighbourhood of Parnassus, and on the
islands of Samos, Rhodes, Chios, and Mitylene, but the chief seat
of leprosy in this region is Crete.                   In Roumania and Hungary
occasional      cases of leprosy occur,        but it   has   ceased   to be      endemic
there.       In Sweden leprosy        is met with       in the districts      of    Anger-
manland, Mendclpad, Helsingland,                   Upland, and Bohus, but it has
diminished        very greatly in recent           years.   The most       considerable
area of endemic leprosy           in Europe      is the west coast of Norway, from
 Stavanger up to Tromsoe, most of the cases belonging to the depart
 ments of Sondre and Nordre Berghus.                   The disease is also met with in
 Iceland.      Turning     to the western hemisphere, there are three endemic
 areas of leprosy in         North America — Mexico, Louisiana, and New
 Brunswick        and Nova Scotia, and it is found amongst the Chinese
immigrants in California.             It  also occurs in Costa Rica          and in the
 West      Indies,    particularly    in Cuba, Jamaica,         St Bartholomew,           St
 Kitts, Nevis, Antigua, Guadaloupe, St Vincent,                 Barbadoes,      Trinidad,
and the Bahamas.              Leprosy is endemic in the elevated              regions of
 Ecuador, and in various parts of Guiana, but its headquarters in
 South America are undoubtedly in Brazil, the provinces of Maranhao
 and    Rio Grande being almost               exempt.      From the southern pro
 vinces of Brazil        the area extends         over  Paraguay and the northern
 parts   of the Argentine           Republic,      especially throughout         the   pro
 vinces of Entre Rios and Salta, and it stretches across the continent
 as  far  as the eastern      frontier of Bolivia.

both contagious and hereditary, and that it is caused by the bacillus
leprae,       but for the present                   we    must confess              ignorance           as    to its
origin.       It    should be stated, however, that the production of leprosy
has been           ascribed to extremes                    and frequent                 and rapid transi
tions of temperature,                   associated      with high degrees of atmospheric
moisture, but            a glance at the             chart will disprove this idea. Again,
it   has been said that leprosy must bear a special relation to the sea
coast; but although                  in isolated      cases     it    does      occur chiefly near the
sea,    its     area     of distribution              completely             disproves           this     theory.
Various articles of diet have been blamed                                    as    its cause — fish diet,
salt or rotten fish, immoderate                       use of     pork, and the use of decom
posed rice or maize.                   It    is,   however, impossible, after studying the
subject, to arrive at the conclusion that any of these causes                                                 is   the
true one.           The mere fact of the very definite isolation of the areas
of   endemic        leprosy goes against                 these theories.

                                           (See Plate      VIII.       A.)
     Synon.     — Framboesia; Button Scurvy; Verruga-Peruviana                                           ;     Peru
viana Wart;              Buba         or Boba,     and Patta (West Indies); Framosi
(Calabar);          Tetia (Congo);             Tonga or Coco (Fiji); Lupani and Tono
(Samoa); Fr. and Ger. Pian.
     Definition.       — Yaws consists of                an eruption of yellowish or reddish-
yellow tubercles,               which gradually develop into                            a    moist exuding
fungus without constitutional symptoms, or with such only                                                as    result
from      ulceration           and prolonged               discharge,             namely,        debility          and
prostration.             It    is    epidemic, and contagious                       by      actual contact.
The period of incubation                           of the poison varies from three to ten
weeks,        and   as   a    rule   it    only occurs once in              a   life-time.
       Geographical Distribution.                   — In Africa, yaws              is   to be met with on
the      west      coast,      from Senegambia                 in     the    north, as far south                     as
Angola, together               with        the westerly Soudan, where                       it    is    especially
frequent in Timbuctoo and Bornu.                                 It    is    occasionally seen in the
Nile Valley,           as     well    as    on the northern and north-eastern African
coast-line.              It    is     very         frequently         met       with        in    Madagascar,
Mozambique, and the Comoros.                                In       the East       Indies        it    is    chiefly
seen      in the Moluccas, Java, Sumatra,                               and Macassar;                   it    is   also

  endemic in Ceylon, New Caledonia, Fiji, and Samoa; and it is met
  with amongst the Hindoo population of Pondicherry. In the West
  Indies it is endemic in San Domingo, Jamaica, Barbadoes, Martinique,
  Guadaloupe, Sta Lucia, and Dominica.                                  It   is found all over Brazil
 and in Guiana, and is said to be rather frequent at Punta Arenas
  in Central America.
        Remarks. — Yaws is distinctly a tropical disease, and the poison,
 whatever           it may         be, depends            for its production        on extreme    heat
 and moisture; but although these factors would appear                                      necessary
 for its production, there must be other causes, for in some countries,
 as     in India for example, where the same temperature and moisture
 exist, yaws is unknown.                            Negroes chiefly suffer from its ravages,
 but no race is exempt,                   although it must be admitted that it attacks
 Europeans with comparative rarity.

 ring in India, characterised by enlargement and distortion of the
affected extremity, due to thickening                            of the cutaneous tissues,        with
 degeneration            and subsequent fracture of the osseous structures.                      There
 are     two varieties of this malady — one, the                        pale or ochroid form ; the
 other,       the melanoid or dark form.
        This     disease         has    been        recognised        since 1712, when      Kampfer
 first called attention to                  it,      but little definite was known          about   it
 until Goodfrey in                 1846, and Vandyke                  Carter in 1860, investigated
        thoroughly.              In all   probability,         as Carter assumes,         the disease
is it   due to                         but authorities still differ             as to the nature of
                 a   parasite,
the parasite, and also as to the nature of the method by which                                      it
finds entrance into the hand or foot affected.                                 It   seems to be clear
that     it   is   not   a   constitutional disease, but the various theories which
have been put forward as to its precise cause cannot be reconciled.
Hindoos of all classes are affected by the disease.                                  Mahommedans

     Geographical               Distribution.             — Broadly            speaking,      this     disease        is
 met with         in its dark variety in Madras,                                  Bombay, the west and
north-west of India,                   whilst cases of the pale variety occur all over

affected,        and the            disease          is   reported        as    being present          at       Pondi-

to definite          physical             phenomena.                It    appears,        however, that          it   is
associated        witli certain definite local conditions,                                   although            what
these conditions are                 it   is   hard to say.              At the      places where          it   occurs
there     isa    heavy         rainfall, the altitude of the district                       is   not high, and
as   a   rule the soil         is    moist, dolometic, and rich in vegetable                               matters.
At the         same time,            it   must be noticed that at Cuddapah the soil                                   is
clayey limestone,              that at Pondicherry                  it   is    clay, and at Tanjore and in
the places where the disease                          is   known on the Malabar coast, the soil
is   alluvial.       It    is   highly probable that                       the disease       has an intimate
relation to the soil; those most affected by                                    it   are persons employed
in agriculture, and who go barefooted,                                   exposing themselves                thereby
to wounds on the feet, which would readily permit the tissues to be
invaded         by   a    parasite,         if       a parasite,          as    we    believe,       causes         the
disease.

     Geograjrftiral         Didrihvtion. — Although                elephantiasis         may      be
 occasionally seen in all parts of the world, it is endemic                                 in cir
 cumscribed areas, in tropical and sub-tropical countries                             ;  in   these
 areas     of distribution        it   is  not uniformly           present,     but     is almost
 always       limited      to   well-defined      foci.       In India,        the    disease      is
 frequently        met     with along         the    littoral      of Lower         Bengal,       in
 Pondicherry,         and at    a few     other points on the Coromandel coast.
 It  is especially frequent in the district                of Tanjore, but must of all
 on    the     Malabar      coast     (principally      in    Travancore         and     Cochin).
 It  occurs at Ramghar, Chota-Nagpore, Sirgooja, and iu the district of
 Tirhoot.        In Ceylon       the     headquarters of the disease are on the
 coast, especially between            Colombo and Matura.                 In  the East Indies
 the places most severely             affected are Sumatra, Bauka, the Nicobars,
 and    Philippines.         In Further India it           is met       with in Penang and
 Cochin-China.            In China elephantiasis             is principally       seen on the
 southern       and     south-eastern      coast    districts,       especially at Canton,
 Amoy,        Shushun,      and    Shanghai.        Some       of    the   worst regions of
 endemic elephantiasis are to be found in the Polynesian Archipelago,
 e.g.,   the    northern       part of New Caledonia,                  the   Tonga and          Fiji
groups,       the    Samoa     group, Wallace            Island,       the Society Islands,
especially       Tahiti, and Kaiatea, and the Gambier group.                            Elephan
tiasis is less frequently seen in the Marquesas and Hawaiian islands.
In equatorial and sub-tropical Africa                      and      the    adjoining islands,
elephantiasis         is   very common, especially in Reunion,                       Mauritius,
Seychelles,        Madagascar,       Nossi-Be,      the     Mozambique and              Zanzibar
coasts,      the    coasts of     Senegambia         and      Liberia,      and    the    Guinea
coast     as   far   as  the   equator.       Further inland elephantiasis is                  met
with in      the Cameroons,        in Bornu, and Sego            ;   and a few cases occur
in Tunis, Algiers,            and Egypt, not far from the sea coast, and in
the swampy valleys of the interior                  of Abyssinia.            Throughout         the
whole of the upper Nile valley and the adjacent districts isolated
cases only are met with, save               in  the   Bari and Madi districts, where

it is    more     frequently       seen.            It    is said to be often found to the
west     of Lake Nyassa.             In the western hemisphere elephantiasis
is met with in New Granada, Venezuela,                                    and Peru, in those parts
of Brazil which              are mostly         tropical         in       character,      on the coasts
and marshy levels of Guiana, on the Gulf coast of Central America
and of Mexico.               Elephantiasis is also seen in the following islands
of the West Indies: — Barbadoes,                         Martinique, Guadaloupe, Trinidad,
St Vincent, and St Bartholomew.
      Remarks.    — Although sporadic                      cases      of elephantiasis              are        met
with, occasionally           in Turkey, the south of France, Lisbon,                                and the
south of Spain,         as    well as on the east coast of Scotland and in some
parts of the south of Ireland, the endemic                                  area of elephantiasis is
from 35° X. to 25°                S. in the eastern                 hemisphere,           and 25" N. to
30° S.      in the      western.          We must,               therefore,         consider that the
disease for the most part depends                         upon high temperature                 and much
atmospheric         moisture       for        its        production.           Where          cases       occur
outside the limits indicated above, it is in connection with moist
soil and humid atmosphere, such                          as is met        with on    sea coasts and the
banks of rivers.              Climate not only appears to influence its pro
duction,     but     variations          in    temperature                undoubtedly           bear      some
relation to its growth, and some observers                                 have    maintained that it
has a lunar periodicity.             At any              rate, as   Hirsch        says,
                                                                                          "   the more flat
and damp the ground is in a tropical or sub-tropical piece of country,
the more         suited does it seem to be for the endemic existence                                            of
elephantiasis."         Various theories have been advanced to explain the
production        of this      disease.         It       has   been         said to be due to fish
forming the staple of diet, to the drinking of water rich in saline
constituents or tainted by organic matters                            ;    and others have thought
that it is   a    form of malarial poisoning, but there are numerous facts
which      prevent these views from obtaining general                                     assent.         It    is,
however, agreed              by nearly all observers                      that the disease            attacks
principally the         male sex, of dark races, over                         twenty years of              age.
Before concluding             this note,       it    may be remarked                   that there         is    an
increasing        number       of observers                who      believe that the              cause         of
elephantiasis      is   the    filaria sawjuinis hominis;                      the maps show how
far     the distribution          of this           parasite        is     identical      with that of
elephantiasis.

     Definition.
                 — The Guinea-worm is               a nematoid       parasite,    usually
 measuring from        1  to 3 feet      in length, and having            a breadth of
      of an inch.     It infests the feet and legs,          as  well as other parts
 of the body that are much exposed.
     Geographical Distribution.        — As    a general rule, the Guinea-worm
 is only found in the tropical parts of the eastern                  hemisphere, and
 even there the area      of its endemic distribution           is limited.      It  may,
however, be conveyed from place                 to place,     and, although        rarely,
 become     propagated     in  a fresh locality.          In Africa,     the principal
area   in which the Guinea-worm is found extends from                        Senegal    as
 far  as Cape Lopez.       In  Senegambia it is met with, not only on the
coast, but    in that    more   elevated      region which extends from Bakel
to Galam, but the parasite does not infest the banks of the Casa-
 mance.      The Sierra Leone          coast   is   less   extensively     infested    by
 Guinea-worm       than the Grain coast,            Ivory coast, Gold and Slave
 coasts ;  it is met   with on the        shores    of the Niger and Gaboon.            It
is to be noticed that on these             coasts    various places, such as Cape
Coast Castle, Elmina, Cormantia, and Accra, are especially affected,
whereas      the surrounding         country     is   very   often free       from    the
parasite.     The    Guinea-worm         is  found       throughout      Sennaar,     the
southern district of Kordofan, and the whole of the Bahr-el-Ghazel,
the district      between     Dem Suliman            and the      Sobat being        very
extensively affected.        It   is doubtful       if it exists south of latitude
6°   N., and in Abyssinia the         parasite    is limited to the     sea coast.
    In Asia the endemic             seats   of the Guinea-worm             are Arabia-
Petrsea, a few points on the coast of Hedjaz and Yemen, and the
south coast of Persia.        It   is said to have been met with in the Bay
of Skanderoom, and it is known in some parts of Turkestan, in Khiva,
Bokhara, and Eokaun, on the shores                   of the Sir-Daria       and on the
northern shore of the Caspian (lat. 47° N).                   In India the Guinea-
worm is most widely diffused in the northern division of the west
coast, the Bajpootana States,          and the western parts of the Deccan.
It  rarely occurs in the North- West Provinces, where                it is only known
at Dchra Dhun, Sirsa, and Hansi.                  The parasite is also rarely met

met       with in      the Mewar             and Marwar              (Rajpootana States); in the
district of Chanda, at Dhoolia in Khandeish,                                  at Nagpore,           in Behar,
at Aurungabad,        Jalnah, Hyderabad, and Secunderabad, on the                                             east
side of the        western Ghauts and in the adjoining districts of                                           the

the district       of Savant-Warri, Balgam, Darwar, and Bellary.
     In   the New      World the disease was imported from the west                                         coast
of Africa into Guiana, Brazil, and the West Indies, but it has almost
disappeared        except at the island of Curacoa,                           and in the small town
of Feira da Santa             Anna in          the province of Baliia.
     Remarks. — It is useful to remember                            certain facts with regard to
Guinea-worm.                In   the first place, all races of both sexes and at all
ages      may     suffer      from      it,    but   it       certainly       attacks by preference
natives who go about barefooted, and                           it   is   most usual in middle life.
In all probability               it   gains entrance            into the body                by   direct con
tact of an exposed part of the body                           with water or mud,                  the parasite
penetrating the pores of the skin.                            There have been many attempts
made       to    connect the occurrence                       of the Guinea-worm                    with      the
geological features of the soil where                          it   is   found, but, although on
the whole        it   is   most prevalent in localities                     composed         of secondary
trap rock,        it   is     also     met     with     where         the geological structure                  is
sand on sandstone.                    There       is
                                                  a     certain relation between                       heat and
moisture and the production of the parasite.                                    It   is   found in places
where there        is   a   mean temperature in summer                         of about 88° F.                On
the whole, the Guinea-worm                        is    most        frequently         met    with       at the
beginning of the rains, and in the hot weather                                       succeeding             them,
although         it    appears        to     be   the     case       that     in India            it   is   most
usually found during the rains.                         It    is    impossible to say how long
is   the period of the incubation of the Guinea-worm, but                                         it   probably
varies from one month to                   a   year, and with regard to the part of the

 cases,  it is met  with in the lower extremities.              In   a person    suffering
 from Guinea-worm the first symptom usually noticed is                   a  cord-like sub
 stance felt beneath the skin.            There is usually some pain, and more
 or less fever, the temperature           of the patient being sometimes exceed
 ingly high.       As the worm           commences      to make its exit from the
 body, a small blister         forms at the point it selects for its escape                ;
 this blister is often surrounded by a distinct rash.

                                     (See Plate    XL)
    Definition.
                  — The      Filaria        sanguinis      hominis     is    a  nematoid
 haematozoon, about the thickness               of a hair, and from        3 to 4   inches
in length, which is found in the blood of                 some animals and men.
    Its geographical distribution is of importance,                 because when the
parasites     gain entrance       into a human being, in the tropics at any
rate, they frequently        induce chyluria, lymphorrhagia, elephantiasis,
lymphangiechodes, chylous hydrocele and varicocele,                         and possibly
also true elephantiasis arabum.               It  may be incidentally          remarked,
that the filaria are almost invariably totally absent                  from the blood
during the day — i.e., from         9 a.m. to 6 p.m.       They commence to appear
between      6 or 7 in the evening, rapidly increase in number until their
maximum is reached about              2  or 3 a.m., and    then gradually disappear.
    Geographical Distribution.            — As far     as we are       yet aware,       the
Filaria sanguinis hominis               occurs    principally,    if not entirely, in
tropical     regions.     It  is known         to  be    indigenous in the follow
ing regions, but it is not improbable                     that future        observations
will show its distribution to            be rather greater      than that which we
can now give to       it    Commencing with Brazil, it is most extensively
distributed throughout the tropical parts of that country, excepting
however the southern districts and the province of Sta-Caterina.                         In
all probability, too, it occurs in Chili, Peru, Venezuela, and Mexico, as
also in Ouiaua.         It certainly occurs in Barbadoes, Cuba, Mauritius,
St Domingo, and St Thomas.                   In Africa it     is found      in Egypt, on
the shores of the Zambezi and Lake Nyassa, the Zanzibar coast,
Mauritius, and Reunion          ;  it is probably indigenous on          the west coast,
and   it   has been     met   with in various districts of             the Negro part

of the Egyptian Soudan (Bari and Madi districts, Bahr-el-Ghazal,
and Uganda).   In Mayotte and Madagascar it almost certainly
occurs, and      it probably exists in Queensland.                       The       Filaria sanguinis
hominis is extensively found                     throughout            China        and    India, but
curiously       enough,    the          Dutch     East Indies           and Formosa are             free
from it.
     Remarks. — From               what has been said,             it will         be seen that the
habitat of the      Filaria sanguinis hominis                     is confined to the tropical
or sub-tropical regions, and it is also of great interest to notice that
the mosquito forms its intermediate host.                          As    was mentioned above,
the   Filaria     are found during the night                in   the blood, and consequently
in   the subcutaneous capillaries, where the mosquitos are able to reach
them.       In   the insect's stomach they undergo developmental changes,
and they are probably discharged with the larvie of the mosquito into
drinking        water, and by this means again                     conveyed into the human
subject.

     Definition.
                 — Scurvy               is characterised     clinically by intense general
debility    ;   sponginess          and swelling of the gums              ;    ecebymoscs      closely
resembling bruises, about the                     thighs and logs ; a brawny hardness
about, and sometimes                    a contraction       of,    the muscles            of the calf      ;
pearly conjunctivae            ;    and    a   sallow aspect,          somewhat akin to mild
jaundice.
     Geographical Distribution. — Apart from the occurrence                                  of scurvy
at sea and amongst                 troops on campaign,            and outbreaks of           it,   which
occasionally occur all over the world in prisons, and among                                         emi
grants who have rapidly                    settled    in given districts, scurvy               is   still
endemic in some parts of the world.                         In Russia          we find one of the
chief seats of the disease at the present time.                               It   is   endemic in tho
Baltic     provinces      and at St Petersburg,                        in the        governments of
Olonetz and Novgorod, along the shores                             of   the        Arctic Ocean and
other parts of the Siberian littoral, such                        as    the    Amoor       region and
at Kamtchatka.            It       is   endemic in Asiatic Russia, along the Chinese
frontier, and also at Tomsk.                     It   is   met with in the government of
Kasan, but more especially in the southern provinces of the empire                                    —

e.g.,   Jekaterinoslav,         the    Steppes of      Saratov,     the Ukraine,        the
adjoining districts of western and little Russia, and in the Crimea                          ;
also   in Kutais (Trans-Caucasia).               The area of endemic scurvy in
southern Russia joins an endemic district in Roumania.                         In Sweden
scurvy may be said to be endemic only in the neighbourhood                                of
Umea, in         the   districts     of Udewalla       and    Jemtlandslan      ;  and in
Norway it is endemic in Finnmarken.
    Scurvy is endemic          in various countries in Asia.             We    meet with
it on the Yemen             coast of      Arabia,   especially at      Aden; in       some
parts of    India,    e.g.,  North- West Provinces, Rajpootana,              and   Malwa;
in Cochin-China,         the northern       part of China, particularly at Pekin,
and in Japan.          In Australia it is      endemic     in the north-west of New
South Wales; and it occurs endemically on the Darling Downs.
    In Africa scurvy            is   met    with in the         eastern    Soudan,      and
throughout nearly the whole of the rainy zone of Africa, especially
during the overflow of the Nile.                  On the west coast of Africa it
is also endemic        in Benguela,       and on the Gold and         Ivory    coasts.
    In  the western       hemisphere,      endemic     centres    of scurvy are found
in the most         northern       latitudes,   in Greenland,         Alaska,     and    the
Ottawa district of Canada.
    Remarks.      — There     are several points      in regard to the geographical
distribution       of scurvy which          are   well worthy        of notice.      Apart
from     its production          in jails and      camps,      during    sieges,   and in
armies on the march,          it  is also met with amongst explorers and at sea.
It   is seen too very frequently in              damp    low-lying      localities, where
 the soil is highly impregnated with saline matter,                       chiefly nitrate
 of potash,       and   where consequently the production                  of vegetables
is scanty     ;  or else   in arid    regions   where cultivation is not practised.
 A number of          general      causes, apart from mere locality, predispose
 to   this   disease.        Malaria,     fatigue,   a   humid       atmosphere,       great
 variations      in   temperature,        bad   water,    insufficient      clothing, and
 residence      in crowded or ill-ventilated           rooms or cabins,        all seem to
 invite the onset of the malady, although,                   as a matter      of fact, its
 absolute    occurrence       is due to the want of fresh anti-scorbutic vege
 tables or of lime-juice which, when not too old, takes their place.

    Definition.
                 — An abscess of the liver, due to hepatitis, sometimes,
 but not always, associated with malaria or dysentery.
     Geographical Distribution.        — Tropical      abscess    of the liver is met
 with all over the Indian Peninsula,                 except    in the very highest
 altitudes, but it is most frequent in the Madras Presidency.                    It also
 occurs in Ceylon, in Burniah and in the Peninsula of Malacca.                        In
 Cochin-China, the Chinese ports, and in the southern and subtropical
 parts of Japan     it is not   so frequently met with, and           it is exceedingly
 rare in the northern parts         of Japan.       The chief seats of the disease
 in  the East Indies are the coast of          Java, Sumatra,       and Borneo, and
 the island of Luchon           (Philippines).        It is much less frequently
 found in Banka, Celebes,           Moluccas, the Riouw-Lingga Archipelago,
 and the Andamans.             It   occurs   in Polynesia, especially in New
 Caledonia, and more rarely in the Hawaiian                     Islands and Tahiti.
 Tropical abscess of the liver is very prevalent in the tropical parts
of Persia   and Arabia, especially        in  the neighbourhood of the Persian
 Gulf and Bed      Sea.
    In African    regions    the disease is most often            found in Reunion,
 Mauritius,     Madagascar,        Mozambique,        Nubia,      and     Egypt;    less
 frequently     on    the    Zanzibar      coast  ;   it   is    very    prevalent    in
 Senegambia,     on the coast of the Bight of Benin and the Bight of
 Biafra, on the Slave and Gold Coasts, and on the island of Fernando
Po.     But along the       coast further     south it becomes less prevalent,
 and is extremely rare south of the Congo.
    In South America it is found in Chili, especially in the north,
in the coast and forest regions of Peru, in Venezuela, and rarely in
Brazil and Guiana.          It  occurs   in Panama, and         is said to be known
in Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Salvador.                       The disease is some
times to be seen in Mexico, more especially                on the west coast.
    In  Europe     abscess    of the liver occurs         in Turkey        and Greece,
southern Italy, and southern Spain.
    Remarks.   — Although       abscess of the liver is occasionally met with
in   temperate   zones,   it is of endemic       occurrence      only in the tropics.

H12              Proceedings            of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                            [sess.
The statistics showing the frequency of the disease are chiefly based
upon the records which refer to Europeans in the tropics, but it also
affects the natives of tropical places.
     There is no doubt that congestion                         of the liver in the tropics is
brought about                by heat and malaria,              and that it most frequently
occurs      in      the      cold      or rainy      season.      It    is to    a    great      extent
caused      by the great diurnal fluctuations of temperature,                                 the days
being very hot and the nights cold, but this is not the only cause.
Malaria may, and probably does, predispose                               to tropical abscess of
the liver, on account of the congestion                        of the liver caused by            it,   and
yet the areas of distribution                     of the two diseases do not coincide.
Alcohol        is   another cause of the disease in question                     ;   this   is   shown
by the fact that             it   occurs chiefly in Europeans, and in Europeans of
the male sex        ;     also that natives who ape European customs of                          drink
ing suffer severely, and that Mohammedans are very rarely affected.
     It   was at one time very generally thought that dysentery was the
great     cause of tropical abscess, but this                    is    not the   case.        The two
diseases do occur together                    sometimes,       and abscess of the liver may
cause dysentery, but many things go to prove that dysentery                                      is    not
the cause        of abscess of         the liver.     In very many instances           post-mortem
examinations have revealed no intestinal                           lesion at all in the case of
deaths      from abscess of the liver.                    Dysentery occurs in temperate
climates,        but      is   not      there    followed       by abscess       of the       liver, as
would be the              case wore      it   the cause of that disease.              Again, in the
tropics women suffer very rarely from abscess of the liver, but are
as    liable     to dysentery as men                   are.     Dysentery       is   very common
in Egypt, whereas                   abscess of the liver         is    of very rare occurrence
there.      Lastly, children are very frequently the victims of dysentery,
but not of abscess of the liver.
     To what, then,               is   abscess      of the liver due?           To the action of
excessive heat (and possibly too to the amount of moisture                                        in    the
air), to chills caused by great diurnal fluctuations of temperature,
and to the           consumption of              a   too stimulating       diet with regard to
both food and drink.
     A    few general remarks must bring this paper to                          a    close.   I        have
endeavoured             as    briefly as possible to call attention to the various
physical phenomena                     which may influence         the production             or spread

of    the variouB     diseases   dealt with.    Although it must          be allowed
that    such factors as heat, moisture, the character of the soil, and so
forth,    do exert a great effect on the production of disease,             it is most
difficult    to estimate   justly or with    accuracy    the parts they severally
play in     the etiology    of  disease.    A wido field for further          research
presents itself in this direction, and one of my objects in compiling
this paper      has been to draw attention        to a subject which          deserves
 close and extended investigation.
     In looking     at the maps which      I  have drawn, it will be seen, on
 comparing them with Plate           XIV.,  that all the diseases depicted, with
 the exception of scurvy, are endemic in various areas where the
 highest mean annual temperature of the globe                 is to be found, and
 it will    also   be  noticed that they are most            prevalent in regions
 having a rainfall of over 50 inches in the year.
     In investigating the etiology of tropical             diseases, certain other
 factors have to be taken into account,             factors which       I have    been
 obliged almost entirely to exclude from this paper,               as,   had   I  dealt
 with    them,   it would   have involved considerable space and a much
 larger number of maps.              The   factors   I   refer to    are    the races
 inhabiting      tropical   regions,   and their     habits     and    customs,     the
 geology and physical geography of the countries,                and the character
 of the vegetation met with.           The regions where the diseases           I have
 included      in my list arc endemic are characterised              by distinctive
  features with regard to food supply.          They are chiefly, although not
  entirely, within the zone where         a vegetable    diet obtains,     and where
  tropical grains and fruits are indigenous.
     In conclusion,      I should like to mention         Dr Lawson's theory of
  pandemic waves of disease coinciding with the isoclinal lines which
  are   found    depicted upon Plate       XIV.      For instance, in       regard    to
  fever, he believes     there is a factor which      determines     its appearance
  at points     more    and more      northward    in   successive    years, and he
 apparently proves that this factor, whatever it may be, revives peri
 odically every second year, or at some multiple of two years, and then
 passes over a more or less extensive portion              of the earth's surface,
 giving epidemic impulse on its way to various diseases, and finally
 disappearing in the north.            He found that        the position      of these
 pandemic waves,         as he   calls them, could be defined from year to
 year,    approximately      at least  by referring them to lines of equal

magnetic     dip (isoclinal     lines).*    I   think that this theory is well
worthy of study.
    I  must reserve      for the present       any further elaboration of the
subject of this paper, hoping to be able to resume                 it   at a future
time.

            Quaternion Note on a Geometrical Problem.
                                 By Professor Tait.

     The problem referred to is that of inscribing in a sphere a closed
  n-sided polygon, whose sides shall pass respectively through n given
  points which are not on the surface.              Hamilton evidently regarded
  his solution of this question as         a very tough piece of mathematics
  (see his    Life, vol. iii.  pp. 88, 426).      In preparing a new edition of
  my Quaternions,      I was    led to a mode of treating this question which
  enables     us to dispense with the brilliant feats of analysis which
  seem to be required        in Hamilton's method.
     The quaternions which Hamilton employed were such as change
  the radius to one corner of the polygon into that to the next by
                                                                                        a

conical rotation.             In the present Note                                    I    employ the quaternions
which directly turn one side of the polygon to lie along the next.
The successive             sides     are expressed                       as ratios of one                          of these qua
ternions to the next.

we have

These equations ensure                        that     if        the tensor of any one of the ps he
unit, those of all the others shall also be units.                                                             Thus        we have
merely to eliminate                  pv       . . .,       p.; and then remark that (for the
closure of the polygon) we must have
   That this elimination                       is      possible we                   see       from the fact already
mentioned,         which           shows that the unknowns                                             are     virtually      mere
unit-vectors    ;      while each separate equation contains coplanar vectors
only.     In other words, when pj and                                          cij are given, p2                      is   determi
nate without ambiguity.
   We may now write the first of the equations thus —                                                          :

The Solubility of Carbonate of Lime in Fresh and Sea
      Water. By W. S. Anderson, Chemist at Marine Station,
      Granton.
                                  (Read May 20, 1889.)
   At Dr Murray's        request,    1 have during the past winter continued
the investigation of Messrs Irvine and Young on the solubility of
carbonate     of lime in its different forms in sea water (the results of
which they submitted to this Society in May 1888); and the
following     notes   of the work done and the results               obtained      by
me,   under     Mr Irvine's guidance, in the laboratory of the Marine
Station, Granton, may be of interest.
   At his     request,   I have satisfactorily checked the results already
laid before you.       This    has also, I understand,   been done by Professor
Thoulet of Nancy.
   In  that paper special attention was given to the solubility of
amorphous and artificially           crystallized carbonate of lime, and the
various forms of coral in sea water.
   The later experiments with Iceland spar show it to be much less
soluble than the above-named           forms of carbonate of lime in sea water.
   As shown in      the Table, calcite is less soluble      in   sea water than     in
pure water, the former dissolving              of the impalpable powder only
0'0082 grammes         per  litre; while distilled water,      free from carbonic
acid,  dissolved during          the same time 0*0251         grammes      per  litre
(more    than three      times as much).          There is hardly any notable
difference in the solubility of calcite, whether in the form of im
palpable powder, or in the condition                of coarse powder, or large
crystals, in sea water       ;  the solubility being only a trifle less with
massive     than with the more finely divided              variety    (see   Table).
With distilled water       there is a very marked difference, the powdered

320           Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                 [sess.
 spar dissolving     to about     double the extent.       A   very important
factor to be taken into         consideration in conducting       these    experi
 ments is the time of exposure.          When the    same sea water stands
 over carbonate of lime for a lengthened              period    a curious      and
 interesting reaction sets in, and the carbonate of lime it has dissolved
appears    gradually   to diminish in quantity and be thrown               out of
 solution again.      This was observed by Professor Dittmar, who, in
his paper on the composition of sea water (" Challenger" .Report), eays
— "It     seems   that under      certain abnormal     conditions     sea water
 dissolves lime largely in addition to what       it contains normally, and
subsequently     will redeposit     even  more than      the  surplus    lime in
crystals of carbonate."      This result  was also found by my predecessor,
Mr A. Drysdale.
    Of  course  such   a condition as this last may not occur        in nature,
as   Dr Murray states, where the sea water is in continual circulation
by tides, currents,      &c, but it will help to explain the gradual
petrifaction   of the porous masses of dead coral reef, which               being
constantly supplied with salt water saturated with amorphous car
bonate of lime on standing, depositing,          will gradually fill up the
interstices, and produce the massive condition all old coral formations
exhibit.     This would take       place in comparatively shallow          waters
and while in contact with carbonate of lime, but in deeper                waters,
and under greater        pressure,   any carbonic acid present might            be
called into play, as shown by        Mr Reid in his     paper   to the Society
in February    1888.
    As is well known,        carbonic acid water has a powerful          solvent
action on calcspar     ;  the more finely divided      it is the    greater    the
solubility.    One litre of water, saturated at ordinary           temperature
and pressure,    dissolved in twenty-four     hours, of the massive 00815
grammes,     and of the powder 0472 grammes per litre, or nearly
 six times as much (see Table).
  '
    In order, if possible, to throw some light upon the condition               in
which the carbonate is present in sea water, a series of experiments
was undertaken on the         solubility of carbonate of lime in solutions
of the different salts said to enter into the constitution of sea water.
    A hard variety of coral skeleton (Oculina coronalis)             was finely
powdered, and the solutions allowed            to act upon portions of           it
separately for four days.

1888-89.]      Mr Anderson on Solubility of Carbonate of Lime. 321
   As in the          case of Iceland                 spar,     the solubility was greater                           in
distilled water than in                  sea water (some             experiments conducted by
Professor      Thoulet,         Nancy,         confirming          this      result in the case of
          varieties of carbonate of lime).
crystalline
   As shown in the Table, the magnesium                               salts dissolved the largest
quantity of carbonate of lime, the solution of sodium chloride
coining      next,    the    calcium sulphate solution                          dissolving              the least.
Calcium       sulphate appears                rather to retard the solubility.                               It    was
to be expeeted that the magnesium salts would dissolve                                             a compara
tively large amount of the carbonate and the sulphate of lime very
little, for such is their action towards the amorphous, or non
crystalline,        form    of carbonate                  of lime.        A solution               of calcium
sulphate dissolves very little amorphous carbonate,                                         but     a       solution
of magnesium chloride, holding the                             same amount as is present                             in
normal sea water, takes up                     a large         quantity of        it,     forming           a     clear
solution,      which       on     standing        throws         out the greater                   part of the
carbonate of lime in              a    crystalline form.              If   a    stronger solution                    of
magnesium chloride be used, rhombohedral crystals of carbonate                                                       of
lime   are    obtained large enough for their form to be seen distinctly
with   the eye.
   This experiment              is    indirectly important,                as   if       there     is   an inter
change       between        the      sodium chloride              and the carbonate                         of lime
entering      the    ocean,       as     is   held        by    Torna1,      we          might      reason          by
analogy that since magnesium chloride dissolves more carbonate                                                       of
lime than sodium chloride                        (although           there      is       seven      times          the
amount        of the second              than of the            first in sea water), an inter
action between these salts would also take place, as —
                       MgCl,         +   CaC03
                                                      =   MgC03      +
                                                                         CaCl2       .
But    such    is    not the         case.      Magnesium            carbonate             is    not        thrown
down along with the calcium carbonate,                                as    would          be      expected         if
such   a   reaction     took       place.        It   seems to be nothing                       more        than     a
question of solubility.
   Sea water acts in very much the same manner as                                              a   solution of
magnesium chloride, as amorphous carbonate of lime                                        is   soluble to the
extent of 06 grammes per litre, which may be taken                                         as the greatest
amount of carbonate               of lime in its most soluble form that                             sea water
can dissolve without the help uf free carbonic acid, in this case acting

as a vehicle for the carbonate           of lime, as shown by the gradual
crystallising out of the greater part that at first dissolved.                After
standing twenty hours, this solution only held 0-186 grammes CaC03,
and after four days 0'162 in place of 0-6 grammes above referred to.
   This soluble action of        sea  water on amorphous carbonate          of lime
has nothing to do        with carbonic    acid.    An artificial   sea  water, free
from carbonic acid and carbonates              of any kind, will dissolve up
quite  as    much.     It  is distinctly confined to the soluble action of
the salts present.
   In  regard to the solubility        of the coral skeleton in the various
salts of sea water,     it will  be seen from the Table that     if all  these salts
be acting together on the substance         in one solution, the soluble action
of the mixture is about the same as that of sea water.                  That is   to
say,  normal sea water, and that artificially prepared              by adding in
proper proportions the salts present in            sea  water to distilled water
free from carbonic acid,        will dissolve practically the same amount of
carbonate      of lime.    But with solutions of the individual salts, the
results are in some cases higher, as in sodium chloride and magnesium
chloride, and lower, as in sulphate of potassium and sulphate of lime.
This  difference is most probably owing to the sulphate           of lime, which,
as before      said, seems to have      a  deterring action on the solubility,
although        when    the carbonate      of lime     is  once    dissolved,    the
subsequent addition of the sulphate has no precipitating effect.
    Curiously enough,        if these results of the solubilities      of the coral
be added up as before mentioned, the resulting figure comes to very
nearly the amount of carbonate,           taken as lime, given by Professor
Dittmar      as  being present in sea water     : —

1888-89.]      Mr Anderson            on Solubility         of Carbonate of Lime. 323
Leaving only           a difference of          1    centigramme per litre in favour
of sea water.
     From this it          appears     to be        a reasonable       conclusion            that the
carbonate of lime present in sea water                     as such,   is there simply owing
to its solubility in the river water flowing into                      it,   the salts present
helping or retarding the solution as the case may                          be.
     It   would seem, according to this view, that (except in special
cases)     the whole of the soluble carbonate                     of lime in sea water can
be accounted for without                the help of carbonic acid as                        a   solvent,
although, doubtless, its local action at great depths and in presence
of decaying organic matter             is   notable.        (See Reid's paper, and               Irvine
and Young's paper, Table               II.,   Proceedings         of Royal Society.)
     It will   be seen by referring to the Table accompanying this paper
that the amount of carbonate of lime dissolved by the various salts
present in sea water amounts to 0-1348                       ;    whilst the total amount
of   carbonate       of lime figured     as present         in    sea water, added to what
it   can yet dissolve,       is   01447, making the difference of                 1    centigramme
per litre in favour of sea water.                   The carbonic acid            is   therefore free
to perform its true function, which                   is   to support the enormous flora
present in the ocean.   Messrs Irvine and Woodhead, in their paper
read before this Society, May 1888, indicate this as follows — " The                        :
relation between plant and animal life in the ocean                                    is   much the
same as that between plant and animal life on land, so far as inter
change of carbon             is    concerned,       considering       the requirements of
marine plant life in the form of carbon, which                             it    can only obtain
from the sea in the condition of carbonic acid."
     The behaviour of        a    solution of carbonate            of lime in sea water on
standing in      a     closed     vessel, where       it    is    impossible          carbonic acid
could      escape,     seems to prove beyond question that its solubility
has nothing          to do    with the        existence          of free   carbonic             acid   or
bicarbonates,        as   the major portion          is   thrown out of solution.
     Again, all the solutions of the various salts present                            in    sea water,
referred to     in   the Table, were made up according to the proportions
in which they exist in               sea water,        with distilled water absolutely
free from carbonic acid.

         §     The observation of this example of adaptability was followed

various salts of lime being added                to the food of the hens, and wc
found that the shells of the eggs laid by them, thus fed, invariably
consisted       of carbonate        of  lime, always        in the     same proportion,
practically, as found in normal egg shells, mere traces of phosphate
and sulphate of lime being present.
      We found that (unless when carbonate of lime itself was given) we
obtained the most favourable results with phosphate of lime, which
was added          to   the    food with      the same         precautions      as   already
described, and seemingly the fowls had no difficulty in assimilating
this    salt,   and producing         from it eggs        with normal shells, thus
bearing out the view we hazarded                    in our former paper that the
lime is carried to the secreting surfaces                  of the duct as phosphate
of lime     and soda.        It would    thus appear that lime salts, in whatever
condition       they     are   absorbed,     are   during     the digestive        processes
converted into phosphate, and carried                   as   that salt to the secreting
surfaces     in the oviduct,      at which     point it probably meets with, and
i3 decomposed          by, nascent      or combined carbonic acid            ; at the same
 time, structureless or amorphous carbonate                     of lime is elaborated,
 possibly in combination with protoplasmic matter.*
      Before concluding this portion of the paper it                  will   be interesting
 to note the observations made               with a view to determine whether
 birds can produce shells from salts of the metals                     having analogous
 properties to        those     of calcium.        Compounds          of strontium       and
 magnesium were, under the conditions already fixed, administered
 to tho laying hens.             Salts of barium could not be employed on
 account of their poisonous nature.                 The result invariably           was that
     *
       A most interesting observation on the changes through which the lime
 salts may go, is that ailoriled by the transference of lime from the shell of thiJ
 chick's egg (Lekmaim, Physiological Chemistry, vol. i. p. 417), where it is found
 as the carbonate, to the yolk and developing chick embryo, where it appears
 in the form of the phosphate.            Prout, Phil. Trans., 1822, p. 365, pointed
 out   further,   that   the   amount    of phosphorus in the yolk remains constant
 throughout     the   whole  course  of development     of the chick, but that there is u
 steady and continuous increase in the amount of lime ; and Lehmann argues
 that, as the egg shell becomes both lighter and more brittle, the limo is derived
 not from without, as Prout suggested, but directly from the shell. He says,
  "Tho phosphorus exists chiefly in the yolk, where it occurs as glyccro-
 phosphoric acid, which during incubation is gradually decomposed, so that
 the liberated phosphoric acid unites with the lime which pusses over by
 endosmosis from the shell into the egg to form this salt."               It is evident from
 this that dialysis plays an important part          in the   process  of  lime distribution
  from the egg shell and its membrane to the growing embryo.

the animals could not produce eggs with shells, the only protection
to the egg proper being                       the        strong     membrane        on which         the
calcareous        covering or outer shell                    is,    in ordinary circumstances,
deposited.
    In   each case these experiments were continued for about fourteen
days, and between              each change of such chemical feeding                     a   course    of
carbonate       of lime was administered, so                   as to   bring the eggs    again into
a normal condition (i.e., eggs having true shells). We found took                            it
about forty-eight hours for the hen to absorb and elaborate
sufficient calcareous matter to reproduce the shell (after absorption of
lime salts), and     similar period of lime starvation again to deprive
                           a
the egg of its shell covering.
  The results of these experiments prove, beyond question, that egg-
producing animals can form perfect eggs only when they have
calcareous       matter in the form of salts of lime in sufficient quantity
present in their food, and that the lime salt found surrounding and
protecting such eggs                is   generally carbonate,            although this may,          in
some cases, be partly replaced                    by phosphate of lime.
    A    series of experiments of             a     similar nature was made by Papillon
                                          lxxi.                         " fed       pigeon and two

strontium, aluminium, and magnesium."                                The ash from the bones           of
the pigeon was found                     to   contain 8-45 per cent, of strontia, "66
maguesia,        and 6"95 alumina.                   H. Weiske-Proskau               (Zeitschrift    f.
Biologic,       vol. viii.     p.
                      229) repeated                        these experiments, but failed to
find the slightest trace of strontia or any noteworthy                                  increase      of
magnesia.
    It   is   of interest to notice that             as    soon as these birds began to              lay
shell-less      eggs, they contracted the habit of                           eating them.       They
were,     at the conclusion of the experiments, perfectly                             healthy, the
only noticeable point being that they were in excellent condition
and very        fat
    If   birds, then, can assimilate and secrete carbonate from other
salts of lime, we consider we had strong ground for the statement
we advanced           in the first portion of our paper                         that coral animals
could     do      the      same      thing,       and we            should    have allowed          this
investigation         to     rest   at this         point.         Mr George Brook proposed
that we should continue these                            experiments with marine animals

and sea water, by which means we might                                       obtain results more in
keeping with the statement                         we had originally made.
      Dr John Murray                 placed       all the resources          of the Marine Station
at Granton at our disposal, at the same time defraying the cost of
the analyst, whose duty it was to watch                                the    progress of the experi
ments and to perform the analyses which appear                                        in the Appendix
to this paper.
      § 2.    Our first object was to obtain artificial                         sea    water free from
carbonate of lime, and this we obtained by adding to fresh water
the salts present             (in proportion shown in Dittmar's
                                 in sea water
analyses in the "Challenger" chemical report), carefully excluding
all     trace       of carbonate           of lime.            The composition of this water
appears         in /Appendix               under        Table     II. ("Artificial          Sea      Water,
No.      1    ").
      On analysis we found that the fresh water employed                                        contained
2-68         grains of lime salts                  (principally        as   carbonate)      per imperial
gallon.             Hydrochloric        acid was added (previous to the addition of
the salts)            in quantity           more         than     sufficient     to    decompose         any
carbonate            of lime originally              present in the water.               The resulting
artificial          sea       water No.       1
                                                   (see       Appendix),      which      had   a     specific
gravity of T026, was allowed to settle in tanks, and was then aerated
by means of spray jets of                      a   mixture of air and this water, sent into
the tanks at              a   high pressure         by the pumping engine attached to the
Marine Station.                  This   aerated water was neutral.
      We collected              a    number of male and female                   common         shore and
edible        crabs,          choosing these            animals    as       being handy        and most
likely       to meet the             general       requirements of our experiments, and
placed them in this water                         No.    1,   giving    them raw mussel flesh for
food.         Whether           it   was    in     consequence         of the change           from    their
ordinary food, or whether                     it   was owing           to the absence of vegetable
and animal organisms in the water,                              or whatever may have been the
reason,    they did not thrive (except upon one another).
      During the early months of summer many beautiful examples
of exfoliation occurred,                   but in this water we never had                 a   case    where
the animal could replace                      the calcareous        exo-skeleton       it   had      thrown
off;    and ultimately the                 undefended animal was sure to become                            a
prey to one or other of his fellow captives.
      With      a     view to watch                their movements more                carefully,       they

 same No.     1  water, in which a continuous current of aerated No.                1
 water was kept circulating, and provided with flint (acid-washed)
 gravel, stones free from lime, and growing sea-weed.                  They were
 fed regularly with raw mussel flesh.
    Some of the jars were placed           in sunlight   so that the water might
 he slightly    warmed (and oxygenated), and others were kept in the
 dark and as cool as possible ; notwithstanding the greatest care,
 however, the results were of         a  negative character so far as successful
 new shell formation          was concerned.        Indeed,   the experiments up
 to this point failed entirely.
    On reference      to the first portion of our paper on this subject,           it
will   be found     that we hazarded the opinion             that there might be
inter-action between        the chloride     of sodium and lime salts present
 in  sea  water,    and     possibly
                                        " production of chloride of calcium,
 which might then be almost directly               assimilated by animals, and
secreted as carbonate        of lime.     Following out this     idea we added    to
a   portion of the No.          1  water chloride of calcium, equivalent in
amount to the lime already present             as  sulphate in the No.    1  water.

each, were     introduced into this water in glass jars provided with

one of these animals cast, leaving a perfect envelope (or shell) con

tinued in this state for two or three days, during                which period it
was very shy and was unable                to feed,   but gradually the animal,
which had, meanwhile, increased in size very considerably, began to
lose its flaccid appearance         and to gain substance,       so much so, that

the   position of the shed          carapace, and     which was a soft pliable

within ten days there         was sufficient calcareous      matter deposited on
the animal to allow           of its resuming its regular functions.           The

of lime upon      the membranous substance.               At first widely    separated
points of calcareous         matter (apparently          spherical in form) were
deposited   ;   these, widening       from      the   nucleus, gradually formed
into   patches, which coalesced and ultimately became an unbroken
surface of hard shell, consisting chiefly of carbonate                 of lime, which
had been       secreted   from     No.   2    water,    although     this water was
absolutely devoid of that substance.               The exo-skeleton thus formed
was found on analysis to consist of carbonate                      and phosphate of
lime    and chitinous      matter in the proportions             present in normal
shells.
    The washed       mussel    flesh  upon which the animals were fed was
found to contain traces of lime as phosphate,                 but the total amount
being less than 0"08 per cent, (and although no doubt, like the hens
the crabs could have elaborated carbonate from this phosphate), was
too minute in amount to form a factor in the                     case,  in the limited
period required by it to form the new shell.
    All the   three crabs confined      in this No.       2 water cast successfully
and formed calcareous envelopes,             but ecdysis occurred so late in the
season that     in two of the three      cases the animals had not vigour to
complete the process,         the cold retarding their powers to such an
 extent that before it was completed they sickened and died.                       This
is in accordance      with the fact that         heat   is a necessary element       in
 the assimilation of lime salts            from     sea   water by these animals,
 ecdysis only occurring          during     the summer months or in               warm
 weather.
    Bromide of magnesium was added to                a  portion of the No.      2 water
 (see Appendix,       No.   3   water),    and a number of crabs               and fish
 were placed      in it.    These all appeared to live in comfort, taking
 their food readily, and thriving, and we have no doubt that the
 same results would       have been here obtained            as with     those  already
 referred to, had the experiments been begun at an earlier period
 of the summer.         Since this paper was read many other excellent
 examples of ecdysis, followed          by complete shell formation within             a
 few days, took place with crabs kept in the No.                 3 water.

made up, chloride of calcium being substituted                 for sulphate of lime
(carbonate       of lime of course being excluded).             This   is referred to
in Appendix as "Artificial Sea Water, No. 4."                  Crabs placed in this
water have lived during              the past winter.       We therefore presume
that sulphate of lime is in no way necessary to maintain the lives of
these animals.         We    also went a step towards determining the           point
as to what salts were           absolutely necessary for the         maintenance of
marine life.         A   solution    containing     2J per    cent,  of chloride     of
sodium in pure water (the amount present in normal sea water) was
first prepared, and into this solution shore crabs were introduced,
but after      a   few days, during which they refused to feed, they ail
died.      Chloride      of magnesium      was then added       to this solution     in
the proportion in which          it occurs  in  sea water.    In this mixture of the
 two salts, crabs and fish seem to live in comfort, feeding greedily,
 but    of course       ecdysis    in such water       was   impossible.     Chloride
 of calcium was added in amount equivalent to the lime in sea
 water,    with similar results        as  regards   the health of the animals         ;
 but this was done too late in the season to allow of ecdysis taking
 place.
     § 3.   In accounting for the phenomena of              ecdysis,  some observers
 have     asserted that crustaceans        have reserves of calcareous       matter in
 themselves,      in the shape of abdominal and stomachical teeth
                                                                              " plates
 and stones," from which they have the power of drawing supplies
  as they form their new calcareous            structure.
     These gastroliths        are    undoubtedly      the   products    of a regular
  epithelium just       as  much    as is the carapace,    and on careful examina
  tion they are found to present the same microscopic structure.*
     These, along       with   the gastric    armature,    are thrown off into the
  cavity of the stomach, where they are dissolved, and whence                     they
  may be utilised for the very rapid deposition of              a  small quantity of
  the lime salts      in  the new chitinous       covering.    There is described     a
  similar small reserve store in the lobster, in the form of small masses
  of rods composed of lime salts, which at the time of the moult are
  thrown      into   the    gastric cavity,     where    they   lie until they      are
  dissolved by the gastric juice.            From analysis made it is evident
  that these reserves are,        if  they play any part at all, first converted

into the phosphate,       and are so carried in the lymph (see " Analysis
of Lymph," in Appendix).              It is to he noted, however, that these
gastroliths are not found in the other decapods (Drachyura),                   so that
any reserve       store can not be     in  the stomach,     but   if present    at all,
and we     see    to what a very slight       extent this can take place from
the analysis, it must be in the lymph, where it is chiefly in the form
of phosphate of lime.
    We think that this theory may be dismissed as of comparatively
little importance, as, even if the teeth and whole inner calcareous
structure could be absorbed by the animals, the amount of carbonate
of lime    at their disposal from this source is so small (a very small
fraction    of the outer covering) that it could not account for any
material part of the new structure.             Consequently such an explana
tion must     be abandoned.        As  a matter of fact this internal structure,
consisting of teeth,       plates,   &c, is not materially          affected   during
the    process     of   ecdysis where      the     other   changes      are   so  well
marked.
    The radical change         caused    by ecdysis      is very     striking.     The
animal in the operation shedding or throwing                  off the whole of its
outer calcareous        shell or structure, along with the branchiae               and
calcareous     supporting plates, at the same time the bulk of the fleshy
muscular matter is much increased,               so much so that we ask           with
astonishment could the animal have ever existed in the discarded
structure    t    "We failed  to find, immediately after ecdysis,           carbonate
of lime on any of the outer surfaces               of the body, but, as already
noticed,      the    abdominal     calcareous      structure   is   not    materially
 affected.
    The method we used to determine the amount of carbonate                          of
lime and chitinous matter was           as  follows :— The    flesh was separated
as carefully as possible from the exo-skeleton and the latter was
 dried and treated        with weak nitric        acid,  by which the inorganic
 matter was        dissolved out.       The chitinous      matter left was        well
 washed and dried.         The lime and phosphoric acid were determined
 in the solution.        In Appendix will        be found a number of Tables
(III., IV.,     and   V.) in which    are given the proportions of carbonate
of lime and chitinous          matter present        in the different portions of
the structures of these animals, and also the composition of the
stomachical teeth.

     In    the crab        it is found that the carapace is formed by a regular

     There        is,   most externally,       a    thin delicate chitinous layer in which

chitinous layer, infiltrated                  with lime salts, which must be removed
by     maceration            in    weak acid before                  the       structure     can     be     dis
tinguished         ;     when so softened and examined in thin sections,                                   it   is
found to be composed                    of    a     series      of layers         of chitin lying very
regularly, one above another,                           this    arrangement            giving      rise    to   a
series of markings more or less parallel to the surface.                                        Running         at
right      angles         to these are other regular markings, the                             meaning of
which we shall              see   immediately.
     These        chitinous        layers rest           immediately              on    a   layer    of     tall
columnar cells, each witli              a     nucleus and           a   distinct nucleolus.           If    now
we again           examine        the lines       in   the     chitinous layer running               at right
angles       to     the     surface,    we        find       that the       distance        between        them
corresponds              exactly with the breadth                   of one of these cells, so that
each of these columnar cells may be said to secrete, time after time,
its little area of chitin.                   In    some cases           the markings in the chitin
running at right angles to the surface                               are more numerous than the
intercellular             spaces, in which             case     there     is     evidently     a    splitting,
similar to that which takes                         place      in the formation of the striated
margin of          a     ciliated epithelial cell.
      These       long columnar epithelial cells send down processes which
rest on       a    very distinct       basement               membrane,          and then beneath this
basement            membrane         there     is      either   a   mass of muscular tissue or                  a
layer of connective tissue,                       in which           are large         vacuolated-looking
cells.        The vacuoles contain                a    material which gives all the reactions
of glycogen.
      It   is   evident from           the.    above          description         that these columnar
cells are the active agents in forming                              the chitinous covering of the
crab, which              really corresponds             to the horny             layer of the skin of           an
animal, or to the thick horny lining of the gizzard of                                       a   fowl.      The

being converted into chitin, and then being sbed               as it  were,  whilst in
the human or other animal               skin the cells,     as they are gradually
pushed away from the parent cells, become horny, are separated, and
so form the cuticle.       This   is a point   of some importance, for the actual
and direct connection of the chitinous disc is not severed                    for some
time, and in that time the chitin becomes impregnated to                    a lesser or
greater extent     with   calcareous     particles, the spaces in which the par
ticles are found being somewhat irregular.                This irregularity     is con
tinued as the chitin        with its lime is continued outwards.            It will   be
remembered       that in the oviduct of the hen the lining epithelium of
the secreting follicles and the superficial epithelium               contained lime
in the form of minute              granules,    that these epithelial cells were
extremely active, and that lime and organic matter were                           being
thrown out on to the surface               simultaneously.       Exactly the       same
thing     takes  place    in this    secreting    layer covering the crab;           the
epithelial    cells perform     a  double function     — the  free end of the cell,
instead    of forming      a separate    secretion   which could be removed           at
 once, is converted into        a   chitinous    material.    The lower and more
active protoplasmic portion of the cell separates the lime from the
 salts brought to     it by the blood        and   lymph, and deposits        it in  the
 chitinous end of the cell, principally in the form of               a carbonate     but
 partially   as a phosphate.
     We    have   already indicated         the process     by which, we believe,
 this occurs (Proc. Roy. Soc.         Edin., vol xv.      p. 314).     The chitinous
 shell, as age advances,         becomes      thicker   and  thicker,    and as each
 layer is formed       it   becomes     impregnated with carbonate             of lime,
 and is then pushed outwards (see also Schmidt, Scientific Memoirs,
 vol. v. p. 10).
     It is an exceedingly interesting fact in connection with this method
 of formation of chitin, that in most              cases  where   there is a deposit
 of   a large amount of matrix          in more or less direct continuity with
 the secreting     cell, and in close contact with the fluids of the body
 (blood and lymph), there is always a larger amount of phosphate of
  lime in the calcareous infiltration than when the matrix in which
  the lime is deposited       is actually separated       from the secreting       cells.
  We shall have again to refer to this.
     § 4. The subject of the absorption of lime salts, and their elabora
  tion  as carbonate    by marine animals, resolves itself into the question

of the change in constitution                     (if   any) which lime salts undergo when
they are carried to the ocean by rivers.                               Tornoe and others assert
that the carbonic acid in                   sea   water    is   in combination with soda;               if
this   is   so,    it   follows that the soluble carbonate of lime on mixing
with the          sea water     is   decomposed           by the alkaline chlorides present,
the result being           the formation of chloride of calcium and alkaline
carbonate.            The results we have detailed seem to give some support
to this view.             If   this be the case,              it   points to the necessity for a
reclassification of the                salts       as    generally       expressed      in sea-water
analyses.
     Such    a    view implies the absence of carbonate of lime from sea
water,      chloride       of    calcium           taking          its place,    from    which        salt
structures of carbonate of lime in                        a   more or less pure state may be
built up by marine animals and plants.                                Our results seem to prove
beyond doubt that all lime compounds, not excepting the carbonate,
are decomposed             during digestion, and appear in the blood in com
bination with phosphoric acid                       as phosphate.              Consequently     it   does
not seem essential              that such animals and plants should obtain the
lime in the shape of carbonate.
     In   the case of the higher forms of crustaceans                          with their   aggressive
habits,     it    may be assumed               that they obtain           a    portion of carbonate
of lime in        a   concrete form from the animals upon which they prey,
and this may help in the new formations of this body by them after
ecdysis,     but even then the carbonate of lime must pass through the
digestive changes              we have         explained        as   preceding its reabsorption.
Of   course,      it    cannot be assumed               that coral polyps have such sources
of calcium carbonate                  at their          command,        but, even    if     their food
consisted         of minute          organisms containing carbonate                     of lime, this
would only remove the question                          as to   assimilation of one lime salt,
and its elaboration as another lime salt, from the one animal to the
other.
     In   the blood of these animals we have,                            in solution, phosphates
of lime and soda, along with                            alkaline      chlorides, carbonates           and
sulphates          associated        with     albuminous             matter,    carbonic acid and
oxygen being also    present                      in varying
                                          quantities (in      loosely                       a
associated or combined  condition). This blood when   freshly drawn
is alkaline, no doubt owing to the presence of alkaline phosphates
and carbonates.

    The existence      of alkaline phosphates      would appear to preclude the
presence of soluble carbonate          of lime in any quantity in the blood, as
when brought together in solution these salts react upon one another
with   the formation of insoluble phosphate            of lime and carbonate of
soda.      Therefore, even     if this  change   is not effected in the primary
processes      to which    blood formation is due, it must take place at
that point when the incepted lime compound (be it what it may)
becomes part and portion of the blood.
    That phosphoric acid combined with alkalies and alkaline                  earths
plays an important part in the functions of the blood, and in tissue,
bone, and shell formation, there can be no doubt.               We find, both in
the case of birds and crabs experimented upon by               us,  comparatively
large and constant quantities present, which seem to have no parti
cular ratio to what they absorb             from their food or sea water, but
rather depend upon the part this acid plays acting as a carrier of
the lime as phosphate or phosphatic albuminate                   to   the  required
point where it is to be transformed in the presence                of nascent    car
bonic acid (or carbonates)         into carbonate of lime, the phosphoric acid,
especially during the period of active growth of new shell formation
following       ecdyses,   meantime not passing out of the body to any
extent but re-entering the circulation             to continue to assist     in the
 process of elaboration of lime salts.
    If   a  solution     of carbonate     of lime    and phosphate of soda in
 carbonic acid be heated         to 90° F., we find that there is a deposi
 tion   of phosphate        of lime     with   a  comparatively      small   propor
 tion of     the carbonate,    the    proportion   of this depending upon the
 relative amount of alkaline phosphate present.              If  these salts could
 be removed         as they are formed, and in        the  proportions in which
 they are thrown down, it would               appear that we should have         just
 those proportions that we get deposited in the matrix of bone.                   We
 shall have occasion to show that we consider that there is actually
 a dialysis of these lime salts into the formed material in which they
 are found deposited.
     Let   us take, for example, developing bone          in any animal.       There
 are several factors to be taken into           account in connection with the
 deposition       of lime salts to bring about the calcification           of bone.
 We    have,     in the first   place, the presence     of alkalies and alkaline
 earths in the blood of animals, combined with phosphoric acid and

carbonic acid.       How marked         are the differences      in   the proportions
in Herbivora       and    Carnivora      may     be gathered      from the      analyses
collected by Liebig        (Letters on Chemistry, p. 406), from which we
gather that the ash of human blood contains 32 per cent, that of
the pig and      the dog       36 per cent., that of the         fowl    40 per cent.,
that of oxen       and sheep not more than from 14 to 16 per cent,
of phosphoric acid, though calves' blood contains about 20 per cent.
    The carbonic acid varies inversely.             In  the ash of human blood we
have    only 3-78 per cent., in that of ox blood 18p85 per cent.,                      in
that of sheeps' blood            19'47 per cent.        In  these    cases, where the
proportion is large,       however,      the carbonate      of lime is secreted by
the kidney cells,       and is carried off in solution         in   the urine instead
of being secreted         as   a shell.     In whatever proportions the acids
are present     they are always neutralised by               a  slight excess of the
 alkalies and alkaline earths.
    Schmidt*      found that the blood of the pond mussel                     (Anodonia
 ryijnm) was slightly alkaline.             He describes     as present on evapora
 tion beautiful     crystals of carbonate          of lime resembling gaylussite.
 These could not have           been   present    originally in the alkaline fluid,
 and   it is probable that they were              produced by the formation of
 carbonate    of ammonia from the              decomposition of urea and nitro
 genous organic matter.
    This    must   occur     in the   case   of the effete matter       discharged by-
 animals.     The carbonate of ammonia produced by the decomposition
 of urea, &c, decomposing            a  portion of the sulphate of lime in the
 sea  water with the formation of carbonate                   of lime equivalent       in
 amount to the carbonate           of ammonia thus formed.
     According to Lehmann,t carbonate of lime in considerable quantity
 is found in the urine of graminivorous               animals, in the saliva of the
 horse, and   in many animal concretions.              The urine of graminivorous
 animals often contains so large           a  quantity of carbonate       of lime as to
 cause a deposit very soon           after its emission.         "My     investigations
 tend    to show that       in the mine of         the   horse   carbonate     of potash
 and   carbonate     of lime very frequently replace            one another;      I  have
 usually found the urine rendered               turbid by the presence          of much
 carbonate    of lime, which contains a very small quantity of alkaline
             *

paper,     while        clear    urine        is usually rich          in    alkaline          carbonates."
Hence it is easy to              see   why urinary calculi consisting of carbonate
of lime     are of very common occurrence                        in herbivorous animals.
     Carbonate of lime also sometimes                      occurs in human urine with an
alkaline reaction, and indeed sometimes,                         though very rarely, we meet
with urinary calculi in the human subject consisting for                                      the most part
of carbonate of lime.                  Prout was the first who made this observation,
but similar calculi have been since found by Cooper, Prout, Smith,
Gobet,      and Fromhery.                 Lehmann         also    points out that in animal
concretions considerable quantities                        of carbonate            of lime may be
deposited with the phosphate.                         Thus he mentions nasal concretions
containing         21'7     per cent,         carbonate       and 4G-7 phosphate of lime;
phlebolith        8'3 per cent, to 24-3 per cent, carbonate,                             and        50-14 per
cent,    to 69-7 per cent,               of     phosphate of lime.                In     the concretion
from the heart of a man with hydrothorax 23 per cent, of carbonate
and 50 per cent, of phosphate of lime.                            In   a    concretion taken from
a stag's        heart     66-7    per     cent,       of carbonate          and    25         per    cent,      of
phosphate of lime.                Some stony concretions from the peritoneum
of   a man were         found to contain 34 per cent, of carbonate                                  and only
19-32 per          cent,of phosphate of lime.   Lassaigno found 83-36
per     cent,     of carbonate of lime in a salivary concretion from a
horse.
     § 5. The next factor to be considered is the mass of active cellular
elements with which the blood and lymph are constantly coming in
contact.         These fluids           must be looked            upon as the                 carrier from
which the cells obtain their nutrient material and                                     also    the vehicle
for carrying off effete matter.                    In   the immediate neighbourhood                             of
these cells most           marked changes               take place         in the composition of
the fluids in which they are bathed.                          One of these changes                      is,   that
there    is     always an increase                in the amount of carbonic acid in
this position, and there                is,   as we have      indicated, frequently, but by
no means invariably,              a    deposition of phosphate of lime with                          a    small
quantity of carbonate.                  If    the salts are removed               at once they may
remain     as such,       but    if   they are again acted upon by the phosphoric
acid and the alkaline phosphates the lime salts are redissolved and
we have     a     return to the normal condition.                           Let   us     see        how this
bears    on the process               of calcification of bone.                   In    the first place,

take an adult        healthy bone and then                      a   growing bone.               The osteo
blasts lay down a matrix                       of formed material.               The more active the
cells,    within certain limits,                      the greater        the         relative amount          of
matrix.         This matrix              may now be looked upon as                           inert   or dead
organic matter,            and       we hold          that it corresponds               to a membrane
through which dialysis may take place, or rather the layers near the
two surfaces         may be               so    considered, and as the molecular com
binations of the phosphoric acid and lime and the carbonic acid and
lime take place             around the osteoblasts                      (which,        as    above       stated,
during their active formative changes                           give off the carbonic acid                    to
render the lime for the time insoluble) there is a continuous process
by dialysis of separation of these lime salts, which first make their
appearance        in the centre of the matrix trabecule where the two cur
rents meet, as       it    were ; from this point                   the calcification            extending
towards the surface.                 "We look upon the formed matrix then as                              play
ing the part of a dialysing membrane,                          that serves to separate the lime
salts prepared        in its immediate neighbourhood                             by the carbonic           acid
forming cells, this carbonic acid causing                           a   throwing            down of phos
phates of lime with a small proportion of lime in which the                                     phosphoric
acid     is usually replaced               by carbonic acid.               It        should be observed
in this connection that the carbonic acid                                 is,    when acting on the
lime solution,         in       a    nascent       condition,       and therefore in                 a   much
better     position        to       combine with any                lime already held by                    the
phosphoric         acid.        That the phosphate of lime                             and     the   alkaline
earths     generally are deposited                     merely mechanically in the bones,
is   very evident,              as       Lehmann        points      out         in    his    Physiological
Chemistry, vol.            i.   p.       414,    because       wo can so thoroughly                  deprive
them of all mineral constituents                         by dilute         hydrochloric acid,              and
as we have         before       pointed out, because          they   the matrix in which
are deposited    vitally and chemically inert, though
                      is                               like  many
animal membranes       may still retain
                                    it  the power  of allowing of
dialysis.        In the         case of newly            formed         bones         or parts of bones
there     is,   according to Valentin (quoted by Lehmann, hie. cit., vol.                                     i.
p.   41"), "always          a    greater quantity of carbonate                       of lime before they
are provided        with their proper quantity of phosphate."                                    This bears
out our theory, because                    it    is   whilst    the cells are most active                     in
building up the matrix that the largest proportion of nascent car
bonic acid will be present, and therefore the period at which a

1888-89.]     Mr Irvine & Dr Woodhead                    on Carbonate       of Lime. 339
rather larger proportion of the phosphoric acid will be replaced by
the carbonic acid in the lime salts.
    Additional      evidence may be drawn from irregular formation and
diseased    conditions of bone.            In  exostosis,     and in the new bone of
a callus, there is always a larger proportion                  of   the carbonate.          One
point, however, should be borne in mind                    ;  after the process of bono
formation is completed, or when it is interfered with in any way,
there will always be a slightly                  greater     proportion      of carbonate,
because     in the      process    of absorption the phosphate once                    formed
is slightly      more     soluble, and is therefore more readily removed.
Phosphoric         acid    is  present      in   larger proportion         in    the     tissues
and fluids in old people, where                 the   tissue changes and          the    forma
tion of carbonic           acid are not going on so rapidly.                      Once       laid
down in bone the carbonates                  are more      permanent than the phos
 phates, i.e.,  it  is more difficult to remove them.                 This  is most notice
able in the bones of old people, where the proportion of carbonate to
 phosphate of lime is always slightly higher than in adults.
    Liebig laid       great emphasis*          on the     fact that the carbonates of
 the alkaline       earths    are soluble in water            containing      free carbonic
 acid, whilst the earthy phosphates                  are also     soluble in water con
 taining    free    phosphoric       acid.       As    a   matter of fact,          both      sets
 of   salts   are    soluble     in  solution       of either      acid.      As      we    have
 already shown, if carbonic acid               be passed      into   a solution in which
 phosphate of lime and an alkaline carbonate                       are present, as in the
 blood, there is immediately              a   deposition of that salt, partly               as   a
 pure phosphate of lime but partly also as a salt of lime in which
 carbonic acid has taken the place of one, or perhaps                        even more, of
 the phosphoric acid molecules.                  It  does not matter then, whether
 the lime in the blood is combined in solution with phosphoric acid
 as  in   the     Carnivora,       or partly       with carbonic acid              as   in    the
 Herbivora, the addition of carbonic acid from the tissue and in the
 nascent condition will cause             a   deposition of the phosphate of lime
 and of double phosphate and carbonate,                 as the   carbonic acid gradually
 and partially takes the place of the phosphoric acid.                          It   might bo
 urged,    that    because     there   is    more    carbonic acid in the blood of
 herbivorous animals, we should therefore find less or greater deposi
 tion of the carbonate            or phosphate of lime on the evolution and

 addition of carbonic acid, but this is not borne out, for                    it must be
 remembered        that the acids cannot be free in the blood, as that fluid
 always gives an alkaline reaction, as both
                                                            " acid " phosphates and
 carbonates     are  slightly alkaline.       It  is only when we have an evolu
 tion of the free carbonic acid that we have any rearrangement of
 the alkalies and alkaline earths,             and a deposition in an insoluble
 form of the phosphate of lime.
    In  the case of the shell of the crab we have an intermediate con
 dition between the shell of a hen's egg and bone                      ;  we have two
 processes     going on, but in a somewhat different manner.                       It will
 be evident,       from   a  careful consideration of the structure of the
 membrane       that secretes the chitin, that it may do something more
 than attend to the formation           of that substance,        for it is found to
 contain    a   very considerable proportion of lime and a quantity                      of
phosphoric        and carbonic      acids.       We    may,    in fact,    assign to     it
 the rSle that we assigned to the epithelial layer of the oviduct                      ; it
brings    lime to the surface,          and in performing           its   protoplasmic
function      carbonic acid is set free in a nascent              condition,      and in
direct contact with the other lime salts                ; we have, as a result, a
large proportion        of the lime passed in as carbonate.                But it must
be    noted that the chitin is directly              in contact with        these   upper
secreting cells, in fact, the younger layers of chitin still form the
upper or older portion           of the cell          Here we maintain that the
direct contact allows of the dialysis             into the chitin of a portion of
the phosphate of lime before              it is completely transformed to the
carbonate.
    As the     carbonate    of lime is formed the free phosphoric acid is
apparently reabsorbed         and utilised afresh.           In proof of this latter
fact,  and     as  bearing on the whole question of lime secretion,                     we
may be       allowed to quote Schmidt,*               who    in speaking of Unio,
Anodonta,        and Helix      describes      the structure      of     the    secreting
membrane        of the mantle    as a  layer of hexagonal cells on which is a
structureless transparent membrane               in which the lime is deposited,
and ascribes to it the function of decomposing the blood, of secreting
a compound          of albumen with phosphate of lime next the shell,
which is decomposable even by the carbonic acid of the air or of
the water,       but   of retaining     the phosphoric          acid    and returning

So that Schmidt was able                      to trace the transition                      stages through
the excess        of phosphate in the mantle                         ;    the albuminate in the
intermediate bathing mucus, and the carbonate,                                   in   the shell.
     We should         be inclined to argue that the carbonic acid in this case
was the result     of metabolic             processes going on             in   the mantle, and that
the carbonate           of lime formed was                       gradually       passed          on    in this
condition from the lime-mucous solution                              (if   present          in that condi
tion) into the membrane again                           by dialysis.             As        the    process       of
shell-formation must necessarily                        go       on slowly,           it   is    not at        all
astonishing that such               a   small proportion of carbonic acid should be
found in the mucous material.                     It   is   used up as     it    is   formed in laying
down the carbonate              of lime in the shelL                       In the           same way, as
before       pointed     out,       there     are      albumen           and     phosphate            of lime
in the oviduct of the hen, although                                the    egg-shell          is    composed
almost entirely of carbonate.

He    argued   from this that the phosphate of lime is in intimate
relation    with cell-formation.         "We     should     be    inclined     to   say
rather,   that  as   the  chitin   becomes      older and thicker the cellular
layer becomes      less active,  less carbonate        is formed, and that there
is thus a more direct passage outwards            of  the phosphate.
    From a careful examination         of the conditions under which calci
fication occurs     in pathological     processes     in the human and other
subjects, we have come           to   the conclusion         that    this process     of
dialysis plays a most important            part in the separation of the lime
salts from the lymph and their deposition              in degenerated      tissues.
    First, there   is  in every case most serious interference with the
vitality of the tissues in which calcification takes place.
    We    have    already seen      that lime      salts are deposited in the
formed and inanimate matrix.              In   cartilage the same thing occurs,
and in some cases the calcification is found even in the hard cell-
membrane of the cartilage cells.            Lime is never found          as a deposit,
visible under the microscope,         in living protoplasm, except near the
 surface of epithelial secreting cells, but it is frequently found in
 the formed material of cells both when it remains part of the cell
 and when actually separated, as where a matrix is formed.
    As further examples of this deposition in matter in                     a state   of
 degeneration, we may take such              a   condition     as   atheroma     of an
artery, in which, during the earlier stages of the disease, we have
 a low inflammatory condition due to altered nutrition of the tunica
 intima followed by fatty degeneration,            and lastly, by extreme         calci-

fication of the fattily degenerated                        material.           On careful examina
tion of such          a   patch it will be found that, during the earlier stage
of calcification, there is always a quantity of fibrous-looking                                    tissue
around the calcifying area.                     Eventually            even this becomes calcified,
often without             the intervention             of any regular fatty               degeneration.
Here        all   the conditions            for    dialysis           are     extremely      favourable     ;
there is first the dead tissue                    in   close proximity            to a blood-stream,
but cut off from           it,   and from the lymph                   both from within and from
the small vasa vasorum by                   a   layer of fibrous or formed tissue, which,
in the first instance,                acts as     a    dialysing            membrane between the
lymph        and the dead matter, and then as                           a     medium in which more
lime may be deposited.                   All pathologists                   are acquainted with       the
similar changes that take place in the middle coats of the medium-
sized vessels of old people, in old unabsorbed infarctions, especially
of the           in the walls of old encysted trichina spiralis, in
              spleen,
extra-uterine foetus formation, especially in the superficial parts,
in    caseous infiltrations           of the peri- or epicardium, on the pleura in
old people,                               in the lung, and in
                      and in caseous tubercular                   masses
softening glands in the human subject, and especially in the
Herbivora.*
      If   we take the last as an example,                     we find that we have              another
factor present, of which mention has already been made in connection
with       bone, i.e., rapid new cell-formation                   in      the immediate neighbour
hood of the dialysing                 membrane,            which in this instance consists
of the fibrous layer immediately surrounding                                     the   caseous    tissue.
Here then are the three factors necessary                                 : — tissue thoroughly       de
vitalised, where we have dead albumenoid matter;                                       secondly, there
is    around      the mass         of   dead tissue,             a    layer     of formed       material
as fibrous tissue, which, as in the                       case   of    bone     or cartilage matrix,
may form          a   dialysing membrane              ;   and, lastly, there           is    the layer of
proliferating         cells always found               in the region of any foreign or
dead mass, which may, in such                     a    case,     be said to take the place             of
osteoblasts       of bony tissue, as generators                       of, amongst other things,

calcification had only just commenced,                  we found that by far the
larger proportion uf cretaceous material was present                        as   minute hard
points immediately beneath the fibrous capsule.                        In   fact, when the
gland was       cut in two,          the caseous       mass     could       be    completely
" shelled out    "
                     from the dense fibrous capsule.                   On the surface of
the central mass were small concretions,                each of which appeared                to
lit into    a corresponding depression           in   the capsule.          Examining the
centre of the mass, a far less proportion                  of lime was           found than
at the     periphery.         Here   then is a fact favouring our view that
dialysis plays       a most    important part in the separation of lime salts
from lymph and their deposition in bone.                 An analysis of the solid
portions of this gland gave the                following results. After washing
away the softer central              caseous     matter,      the remainder,          124-60
grs., was     ignited, by which          there was         lost 111*13 grs., leaving

   It will   be seen at once from this analysis that the proportion                           of
carbonate     of lime is considerably             greater       than in the bones             of
cattle,    in which     the proportion         on the above calculation would be
as 81*26 phosphate to 9*85 of carbonate.
   It   is to be borne in mind, however,               that there is usually a large
area of granulation,           or small cell tissue, around the fibrous layer,
and     that consequently the conditions                approach more             nearly the
secreting    surface    of    the oviduct      of the hen say, where we have the
thick layer of secreting protoplasm with the evolution of a consider
able amount of carbonic acid.                  There    is,   however,      a    considerable
proportion of phosphate              of lime directly         separated      and deposited,
not in the fibrous layer in the first instance, but in the dead tissue
beyond it.
   The process here differs somewhat from the allied process in bone,
in this respect, that in bone there              is   the separation         always taking
place from two surfaces of the trabecular, the deposit appearing in
the middle and gradually extending outwards, whilst in the case of

the degenerated          gland the separation takes place on one side of the
membrane, and the deposition on the other, where there is                      a mass   of
dead albumenoid material which readily takes up all the lime salts
brought to it.          That there is an outward current of certain material
in the     case  of tubercular caseous masses enclosed in            a  fibrous capsule
is extremely probable, from what we have observed                     in waxy disease
associated with tubercle.
      The    tendency       to  calcification    in   degenerated        areas     in  the
herbivorous animals has long been a subject of remark amongst
comparative pathologists.             This tendency      is markedly        exaggerated
where the area is in any organ in which the tissue metamorphoses
are specially        active.    For   instance,   in tubercle of the           lung and
udder in the cow, calcification follows caseation                    with    remarkable
rapidity,      especially in the latter organ.         In  a   case of acute miliary
tuberculosis        in  the horse, for specimens       of which we are indebted
to Professor M'Fadyean,            this calcification has taken place at once,
and the whole of the caseous material in the centres                        of most     of
the minute tubercular nodules are infiltrated with globular particles
of insoluble       lime salts.    Around this central portion        there are usually
a    few hyaline-looking       cells, which have evidently taken the place of
the fibrous tissue as a dialysing membrane,              and outside this again we
have     the actively proliferating         granulation     tissue   characteristic of
this process.         It  is a well-known     fact that in febrile conditions in
 Man      and in the Carnivora,         where there is        an   increase     in tissue
 metabolism, indicated by the rise of temperature                 of the blood, there
 is always, or usually, an increase          in the amount of triple phosphate
 of lime, magnesia,          and ammonia deposited in the               urine.      Under
  similar circumstances,       in the Herbivora, on the other hand, wo have
 an increase      in   the quantity of carbonate       of lime, frequently in the
 form of peculiar dumb-bell             shaped     crystals, deposited after the
  urine is passed.        In both   cases the increased      activity of the tissues
  leads to an increased         evolution    of carbonic     acid,   and we have a
  beautiful     experiment      in nature corresponding          to our experiments
  relating to the precipitation          of  phosphate and carbonate              of lime
  from    a   solution of phosphate of lime             and alkaline         carbonates,
  the proportions        of the   two salts     precipitated,     varying      according
  to the  relative amount of phosphoric and carbonic acid present.                    The
   tissues here playing the part of carbonic acid formers in the process.

The importance of this difference               in  the constitution of the urinary
salts should be appreciated            by clinicians.
    To    return     to  the examples         of calcification.        Another,     bearing
upon the point in question,            is the calcification going on        in the    super
ficial layers of tissue of the new growth in a case of extra-uterine
foetation.      Here, again,       we     have the        dead  matter in the centre
surrounded by a layer of fibrous tissue and again by a granula
tion tissue layer.          The calcification appears          first in the superficial
dead     tissues    immediately        beneath the fibrous layer.               The     same
tiling    occurs    in the membranous             cyst of the old trichina spiralis.
In    the    uterine fibroid      the centres         of calcification are numerous,
at first small,        but they gradually           run together     ;  their method of
formation appears to differ from                  any that we have          examined in
other positions, but even in them the evidence is not at all against
the theory of dialysis           into the dead tissue.             In connection with
this process of calcification our attention was                    drawn by Mr H. A.
Thomson,        M.B.,      to  the     peculiar      solid    wedge-shape      "infarcts"
 found near the ends of tuberculous bones.                      Konig     describes    them
 as  probably the result        of   a  cutting off of the blood supply from                a
 small wedge-shaped           area,    as in any other example              of infarction.
 Numerous objections have been taken to this explanation, and the
 masses have         been said     to   be   due    to the formation of tubercular
 sequestra.       In all probability        both processes enter into the causa
 tion of these pale hard masses.                 Owing to the tuberculous changes
 in  and around the vessels, in such a case there is formed an infarcted
 area.     This   is borne out by recent experiments by                   Klein, Watson,
 Cheyne, and others.           But beyond this,          the infarcted area, there may
 or may not be a primary tubercular                   process.    Even when there is
 no primary        tubercle the osteoblasts          and other cells first proliferate
 and    then die in situ ; they, then,                as   in other positions, become
 swollen and hyaline, and are then rapidly infiltrated with lime salts,
 and the infarcted bone assumes a much denser                      appearance     than the
 normal bone surrounding it.               It  is conceivable that the lime salts in
 such    a dense      compact     tissue can only come by some more or less
 mechanical process such           as we have        described.     A similar condition
 occurs     in   certain diseases        of bone,        especially    during    the later
  stages    of osteo-sclerosis       where       that    condition    is associated     with
  specific disease.       The conditions are the same in all                 cases, — dead

these will        suffice for our present purpose.
     Fokker*        maintained that he had been successful for the first
time in preparing albuminate of lime as a translucent gelatinous
 mass which " is soluble in water in solution of sodium chloride and
 in phosphoric          acid.    Its   aqueous      solutions are not coagulated by
 boiling     except      after the addition         of neutral salts.       They are pre
 cipitated by          acids,   the precipitate being soluble in excess."                He
 gives     a   series    of experiments to prove that lime albuminate                      is
 present in the blood, and that              it there    behaves   just  as do artifically
 prepared solutions of lime albuminate, i.e.,                 " it can be preserved      for
 some time in vacuo without depositing calcium phosphate,                         but this
 is gradually thrown down by caustic alkalies and precipitated by
 ammonium oxalate," and he concludes that it is probable that all
 the lime in        the serum       is present as lime albuminate, and that no
 other lime compounds exist in the blood.
      It is certainly quite possible that this may be the case, but not
  very probable, though            the albumen may be the medium in which
  many of the changes are brought about in the rearrangement of the
  salts of the alkalies and alkaline                 earths  in the various chemico-
  physiological processes.            On the other hand, phosphate of lime is
  found in all animal            tissues,  in the blood, in urine,          serous   fluids,
  saliva, and in gastric juice          ; it is soluble in chlorides of sodium and
  ammonium, in combination                with protein compounds, lactic acid or
  sugar, and we know             that it may be present in solutions made up
  experimentally.           From the fact that protein compounds keep the
  phosphate of lime in solution, and from what has been observed
  in the oviduct of the hen, and in the mantle of Anodonta, &c, it is
   possible,    as   Fokker    \   suggests, that the lime may be held              in the
   blood, and perhaps also in the lymph, in part                    as a  lime phosphate
   albuminate, from which the carbonate                   is formed by the accession
   at any point, but especially on a free surface,               of a large quantity of
   carbonic acid, the phosphoric acid being again absorbed and reutilised.
      Without doubt the phosphoric acid and lime appear to                                be
   associated with the albumen present in the blood, and although                        we

cannot with certainty isolate the compound, or,                   as yet, do    more    than
indicate      its   composition, there         is   sufficient      evidence     that     the
changes we have          indicated may occur            through the instrumentality
of such     a compound.
     The    same     thing   may    be said      in   regard     to the association         of
carbonic acid (as          alkaline    carbonates)        with    albumen,     both acids
being always present in the blood of animals in varying quantities,
and, as asserted         by Liebig, the proportion of these acids may vary
to almost any limits, without              altering the general character            of the
 blood.
     Thus we have, without disturbance to its general                     characteristics,
two distinct conditions existing in the blood of animals, and these
 conditions, in addition to those already mentioned,                    may, and    doubt
 less do, account, to some extent, for the secretion                 of lime salts   in the
 different forms in which we find them to occur                  — in   the one case the
 Bccretion taking the form of phosphates                as   in bone, and in the other
 that of carbonate of lime, as in shell and coral formation.
      In other    words,   when alkaline phosphates               associated    with lime
 and albumen        preponderate      in the blood,       the lime is secreted      in the
 form of phosphate,          as   in   bone    formation, so when the alkaline
 phosphates       are   partially    replaced     by an excess          of alkaline      car
 bonates, as in marine animals, the lime is secreted                       principally     as
  carbonate.
      In neither    case  are the lime compounds deposited                in a pure   form,
 as     when the phosphate         predominates        it  is always accompanied by
 a   certain amount of carbonate,           so when the carbonate           predominates,
 phosphate      of lime is always present          as we      found them in bone, and
 shell, and coral formation.            It  may be assumed in the one case that
 the albumen          becomes     converted into          gelatine,    which    forms the
 structure in which the phosphate               of lime is deposited         in bone, and
 in    the other into a chitinous mass in which the carbonate is deposited
  as   in the exo-skeleton     of crustaceans       or the shell of the egg.
      These views are founded upon actual                  experimental results, for        if
  a  solution of alkaline phosphates           and soluble lime salts in carbonic
  acid is allowed to stand          for   a  short time, the clear solution soon
  becomes      cloudy, and      a  precipitate is formed which                is found     to
  consist of phosphate        of lime, and the same thing happens with                      a
  solution of alkaline        carbonates      and soluble lime salts           in carbonic

acid, but       in this   case   the   precipitate   formed     is  found    to  bo
carbonate of lime, the precipitation          in both cases being facilitated
if   the clear solutions are maintained          at a temperature        of 90° F.
When      a  mixture of alkaline phosphates and carbonates             and soluble
lime    salts are so treated,  the precipitate which results is found to be
a mixture of phosphate and carbonate of lime — the amounts varying
with the proportion of the salts present.
    Thus bone contains from 50 to GO per           cent,  phosphate, and from
 6 to 10 per cent, carbonate        of lime, and the       calcareous     shells of
 crustaceans and eggs of birds          contain from 60 per cent, to 80 per
 cent, carbonate with 1 to 2 per cent, phosphate of lime.
     We   have thus given a rational explanation of the chemical changes
 which probably govern the secretion of different lime salts by animals,
 but in such investigations, dealing with matter in its relations to
 protoplasmic or vital force, we can only reason by the inferences               we
 may draw from the imperfect knowledge we obtain experimentally
 in the laboratory.
     The ordinary methods of analysis fail             to give us an accurate
 knowledge       of the relative     position   occupied    by matter in the
 complex relations existing in such conditions.
                                     Summary.
     We    assume that the greater part of the carbonate          of lime in the
 ocean-beds     is the result of animal life.
     Soluble   carbonate    of lime is present in very small quantities in
 sea water, but       other salts of lime, especially         the   sulphate, are
 present in larger quantities.
      Hens supplied with sulphate of lime, but no other lime salt,
 produce well-formed egg-shells composed of carbonate               of lime.
      In the organs of the body, gizzard crop, and fajces of a hen so fed,
  only a small quantity,      10-08   grs.  of carbonate    of lime was found,
  but there was     a considerable quantity of phosphate of lime present.
  (It  was afterwards found       that sufficient carbonate       of lime, for the
  formation of the shells of two eggs, could be stored up in the crop,
  gizzard,   &c).
      In the alimentary    canal sulphide    of calcium and then phosphate
  or chloride of calcium, or lime soaps may bo formed.               These latter,

   The lime may then be carried to the secreting                                                    surface of the

the organic            membrane, and the shell                        is   formed of insoluble carbonate
of lime.
   In certain              egirs    the        carbonate         of lime          is   partially replaced by
phosphate.
      If   this takes place in hens,                        it   is     probable       that similar            processes
may go on in connection with                                the formation of carbonate                          of    lime
by marine              animals, which have the sulphate of lime presented                                                to
them in the presence of chloride of sodium.
      In    the       case      of the         crab,       sulphate of lime                   is    apparently not
awiniilatcd, even in the presence of chloride of sodium, and crabs
which throw oil' their shells in aititicial                                     sea water,          in which          both
the above             Halts     are present,             but from which chloride of calcium                              is
excluded, do not form                            a   new     exo-.-keleton             of carbonate            of lime.
As soon          as    chloride of calcium                  is   added, although                   the sulphate be
withheld, shell formation may go on.
   ¦Shell        formation in the crab                     is    somewhat          diiferent from egg-shell
formation             in   the hen, and occupies                  an intermediate position between
such       egg-shell           formation and bone formation,                             as    the carbonate of
lime,      is   deposited         in the ehitinous portion of growing epithelial cells
in the crab shell.                      In     the egg-shell            it   is   deposited           in   a   material
quite separated                 from the shell, whilst in bone, the matrix in which
the        lime       is   deposited,          though separated,                  is   intimately          connected
with small cells, not epithelial in character.
   In       the       eggshell           the     organic and inorganic material are both
secreted          by and         then        separated       from the epithelial cells.                          In    the
crab shell the organic material
                                  (chitin) remains attached to the upper
part of the epithelial cells, and  in this the lime salts are deposited,
probably by                a   process         of dialysis, whilst in the                      case    of bone         the

closely      associated     with    the cells,    especially during its formation,
 and the lime        is deposited    in the matrix, also apparently by a process
 of dialysis.
      Phosphoric       acid combined with alkalies and alkaline earths                  is
 found in        large   and   constant quantities in the blood and lymph.
 It   acts as a carrier of lime,        &c,    to every point of the         body where
 carbonic acid may be given off.                 Carbonate of lime is formed, and
 the phosphoric acid re-enters              the circulation       to continue its work
 as a carrier.
      The nascent carbonic acid given off by the cells in the neighbour
  hood     of the      bone    matrix,    brings      about     precipitation    of bath
  phosphate and carbonate             of lime, which salts are dialysed into the
  matrix.       In   most of the secreting        layers and in the tluids supplied
  to them, lime is found as some form of phosphate.                     Where the tluids
  bathe the matrix, or where there is no intervention                   of an epithelial
  secreting    layer,   the lime is thrown down very largely as phosphate
  as in bone, but where an epithelial secreting                layer is found, or where
  there    is much distance        or tissue    between     the fluids and the seat of
  deposition, carbonate of lime preponderates.
      In  the secreting     layer of the mantle of certain molluscs,           or in that
  of the oviduct in the hen, the lime in the epithelial cells is princi
  pally phosphate,        whilst   the fluid     bathing its outer surface and the
  shells themselves         contain the lime, principally,            in the form of     a
  carbonate.         If  there  is a definite       interval    between    the secreting
  surface and the area of deposition, or               if much chitin     or other tissue
  is developed        between    the actively secreting         cells and the tissue in
  which the lime is deposited,             there    is always a greater tendency        to
  the formation and deposition of carbonate of lime.
      Lime salts, of whatever form, are deposited only in vitally inactive
  tissue.     They are found in bone matrix, in chitin, in old fibrous
  tissue (1), or in tissues that have undergone fatty or caseous degener
  ation.     Wherever        such dead     tissue    is found, dialysis     goes on, and
  lime in an insoluble condition is deposited.
       Although the lime is deposited in dead tissue and dialysed through
  a vitally      inactive membrane,         it  is apparently       separated   from the
   fluids of the body through the activity of carbonic acid secreting
   protoplasm of cells.

    When alkaline         phosphates         associated       with lime and albumen pre
ponderate in the blood, the lime so                   separated is in the form of phos
phate, as     in   bone formation;          when these are partially replaced by an
 excess  of alkaline      carbonates as        in marine animals, the lime is secreted
 as carbonate.
    The corals have a secreting                 layer of cells similar in all essential
 features to the secreting layers above mentioned, and the products                                  of
 their activity assume the same forms,                       chitin, chitin infiltrated with
 carbonate      of lime, and almost pure carbonate of lime with a small
 quantity of organic cementing material
    Carbonate of lime may be formed as follows                           : —
    The carbonate of ammonia produced by the decomposition                                    of the
effete products        of animals,        urea,     &c,     decomposes        a portion      of the
sulphate of lime in the              sea  water with the formation of carbonate of
lime equivalent in amount to the carbonate of ammonia thus formed.
    We take this opportunity                   of    thanking         Messrs Drysdale             and
Anderson,        who,      as   chemists,         attached       to the       Marine        Station,
Granton,       gave us their            hearty assistance          during the period over
which these investigations extended.

Theoretical Description of a New "Azimuth Diagram."

    About thirteen years              ago, when officer of a vessel                     trading from

error of the compass by azimuth's declination, the idea first occurred
to me of projecting the sun's path on the plane of the horizon                                      ;  and
during      the voyage         I  succeeded          in solving         the problem, and con
structed      a   diagram which            I    used       daily while          at  sea for      several
years,   until     I   gave up long voyages,               and had no further occasion to
trouble about azimuths.

      I will    not attempt to illustrate                    the correctness         of my theory by
any purely mathematical formula;, but will confine myself                                      to stating
as plainly as possible, and as far as                           I    can remember,          the train of
reasoning by which                     I   succeeded     in constructing          the diagram.
      Suppose that the latitude is                        90°    N., that is          to say that         the
observer is standing on the North Pole, it is quite evident that the
sun's path, projected on the plane of the horizon, would bo a circle,
and     also that, no matter what the declination was, the sun's bearing
¦would        be the same at the same                        hour    every day, say Greenwich
time, its altitude only being affected by a change in declination.
      Again, suppose the observer to be on the equator and the declina
tion    0°,    it   is self-evident              that the sun would rise due east, ascend
on     an azimuth              circle to the zenith, and descend due west                       ;   so that
his path, projected on the                       plane of the horizon, would               be a straight
line.      Suppose,             again, that the observer is               still   on the   equator,       but
the sun is in declination 20° N., by calculation his rising amplitude
-will be E. 20° N., and setting amplitude W. 20°                                          K,   while his
meridian zenith-distance will                       be 20°     K.
      Suppose the length of the line which represents                                the sun's path to
be fixed at any length, say about 8 inches as in diagram, then all
that is necessary to get the bearings to fit in                              as    by calculation is to
shift the position of the                        observer,     in an opposite direction              to the
declination,              a distance          equal to the tangent of the                   declination,
taking half the length of the line                        as   radius.
      Now, if the              sun's       path may be represented                on the plane of the
horizon, by           a   straight line for lat. 0° and by                   a    circle for lat. 90°, it
is,
 I      might say certain, that                    it   may be represented            by an ellipse for
any intermediate latitude,                        on something the same principle                     that,
while the crank-pin of     steam-engine describes
                                             a        circle and                     a                    the
crosshead travels in a straight line, any intermediate point in                                           the
connecting-rod                 describes       an ellipse.       The relative            lengths of the
major and minor axes of the ellipse which will correctly represent
the sun's path for any particular degree of latitude may be illus
trated in the following                      simple manner       :  — If   a     disc be held so      as to
throw its shadow on a plane,                        with the disc         edge on to the light, its
shadow         will       be   a   straight line, corresponding to the sun's                        path in
lat. 0°;      if    held flat to the light,                  its shadow will be            a   circle, the
same as the sun's path in lat. 90°                         ;   and   if   canted so that        it   is   20°

from being edge on to the light, its shadow                       will   be an ellipse            which
will correspond with the sun's path projected on the plane of the
horizon in lat. 20°.   In the same manner, whatever may be the
obliquity         of the disc, its          shadow will be an ellipse of                 the        same
relative dimensions as that representing the sun's path, in the lati
tude corresponding to that obliquity.                       It will    at once be seen that,
constructed on this principle,                     the major axes of all the ellipses
would be equal to twice radius, consequently to each other, and
would run into each other at the east and west points, and the
minor axes would be equal to the sine of the angle of obliquity, or
sine of lat.
  This arrangement would answer very well while the declination
was 0°, but in allowing for declination the position of observer
would have to be shifted in the opposite direction by the following
quantity      :   — (tan of      decl. x cos of lat.).     This would require a sepa
rate scale of declination to be                   laid down for each ellipse of latitude,
which, to say the least of                 it,   would be extremely inconvenient                    ;   so,
to make the scale           of declination available for all latitudes,                  I    decided
to vary the size of the ellipses instead of the scale of declination.
That    is   to say, instead of     multiplying the tan of declination by the
cos of latitude,      I     divide both major and minor axes of any particu
lar ellipse by the          same quantity.            The formula would therefore be
as    follows: —
     Kadius                                           S. lat.
     (joa jat
                   = sec   lat    = maj or axis,
                                                 cog    ^
                                                                = tan lat. = minor axis.
It   will    easily be seen that this preserves                 the relative lengths of the
major and minor axes of the ellipse for any degree of latitude, as                                  illus
trated by the shadow of the disc, because                        as   radius   :   sec   :
                                                                                         :   sine   :   tan.
     This arrangement               also   allows     the declination          to    be measured
and marked off on the same scale as the latitude                               ;    and further,          it
locates      the foci      of all the ellipses in the            ends    of the straight line
which represents            the sun's path in lat. 0°,          a   great consideration when
*he ellipses         have to be drawn with pins and                       a    thread        as
                                                                                              I      have
always done them.
 I     have taken          it   for granted that the sun's path, projected on the
plane of the horizon, will be exactly the same at all times of year,
the whole ellipse' representing said path being shifted north or

south (according               as    the    declination is north or south), a distance
corresponding to tan of declination with half the distance between
the foci        as radius.          (If half   the major axis of any ellipse be taken
as radius, then           it would         have to be shifted a distance = tan decl. x
cos lat., which would be just the same.)   It however, obviously     is,
impossible to make the ellipses shift on the paper, so the difficulty
is   very simply got over by supposing the position of the observer to
be removed to            a   corresponding distance in the opposite direction, as
illustrated in the case of lat. 0°, and as laid down in the directions
for using         the diagram.
I         have    only constructed my diagram up to lat. 60°, which                       I       con
sider high enough for all practical purposes, but                          it   may be observed
that for        lat. 90° the major and minor axes would                     be   infinity, which
it   may be said reduces                   the ellipse for that latitude to          a    circle as
required by my first supposition.
     Having calculated               the dimensions of the ellipses,             the next step      is
to fix the position of the sun on them at any time, and       evident               it   is
that the noon line in all latitudes will correspond with the meridian
or minor axis of             the ellipses, as the sun      is   either due north or south
at noon, apparent time in all latitudes.
     It    is    also equally certain that the six-hour                line will be at right
angles to          it,   andwill correspond with the major axes of all the
ellipses, as          the sun will just have performed one quarter of his
diurnal revolution             at this time.
            at the position of the intermediate hours, &c,
     To arrive                                                proceed                I
as follows — Take any ellipse of latitude and with centre
                  :                                                (see                       0
diagram), and half the major axis of the ellipse as radius, describe                                a
circle about the ellipse;                   divide the circle as minutely as may be
required (say, into hours and quarters), and from these divisions
draw lines parallel to the meridian, cutting the ellipse, and where
they cut will be the position of the sun on                     it   at that particular time.
This routine             has to be gone          through for, say, every fifth degree of
latitude; and when the points on the ellipses for each particular
period have been joined in   regular sweep, they will be found to

 principle of the new method.]
    Capt. Weir's singularly elegant construction not only puts in a
 new and attractive light one of the most awkward of the formula;
 of Spherical Trigonometry, but it practically gives in                                      a single-page

 plane construction of a function of three independent variables.
   In the usual notation for spherical triangles, if A be the zenith,
 C the pole, and B a heavenly body (whose declination is                                           8),   C   is

      Vitellin, and Serum Globulin, by Heat. By John

    A   large    number     of proteid substances,     when in solution,       are
coagulable by heat.          As the temperature of such        a fluid is raised,
faint  opalescence     at first appears, and then, at a higher temperature,
masses     (flocculi)   of albumen separate out, in most cases, suddenly,
from the fluid.        It is  generally held that each coagulable albumen
is so affected at a definite temperature          peculiar to itself  ; thus, egg
albumen is said to become opalescent            at 60°  C,  and to separate out
in flocculi at 63° C.         Unfortunately,    hardly two observers agree      as
to  the exact temperature at which              opalescence    and coagulation

occur  ;    thus,     keeping        to    the     example,         egg     albumen,      WurLz
puts the       coagulation point at 73°               C, and Henrijean               at  60°       to
61° C.
   It  is hardly possible            to explain       such    differences,       either  on      the
assumption that any of the                    above     authors        had     used   imperfect
apparatus,       or,  that they had been guilty of inaccurate                           observa
tion.    It    is move     probable that the             conditions, under           which       the
experiments         were     performed,         were   not always the same.                What
are the conditions which               are capable      of modifying the coagulation
point of albumen          1    It   seemed       to us    a   not unimportant           point     to
investigate systematically               these conditions        ;    as   such   investigation
is calculated to throw          light     on the nature of coagulation               itself,    and
may enable one to arrive at the exact specific coagulation                             points of
the   more       important      proteids, heated           as they should            always bl
under      exactly      similar       conditions.         The        conditions      modifying
coagulation, which wc have                   studied, are, — the rapidity at which
the coagulation is allowed to take place, the degree of concentration
of the proteid substance              itself, the presence            of acids and alkalies,
and the presence of soluble salts.
      Tlic   liajiii/iii/  at which       Coagulation is allowed to take place.
    This   is an acknowledged factor varying the indicated temperature
 of coagulation, and at least one author has alluded to it in the                             case
 of the    particular albumen studied by himself.                           If  a solution   of    a
 coagulable       proteid bo heated quickly, the proteid will be found to
 coagulate     at a higher temperature              than   if  the heat be applied more
slowly.      Thus we found that egg albumen, diluted with one volume
 of water, coagulated         at 64°      C,   when slowly heated, the temperature
 taking forty minutes to reach this point.                       Another         portion of the
same     solution      coagulated         at   66°    C,    when         heated    rapidly,     the
experiment taking in this case only one minute.                             It  is not difficult
to explain this fact.            If   a  drop of an albuminous fluid is mounted
for microscopical examination, and,                   if it   be heated on the stage of
 the  microscope,       the process        of coagulation can be readily followed
 out.    When opalescent,           the fluid      will  be found to contain numbers
of tiny granules.           These      granules increase           in size, and apparently
become      adherent,       and    run     together      to   form       granular     masses or
flocculi.      This naturally requires              time, and        if the fluid     be heated

rapidly the temperature may materially increase                    above   the   point
at which, were the fluid kept for a sufficient                    time,   coagulation
"would occur.        Although      our experiments convince us of the general
truth of this fact, it occasionally            happens   that an albumen slowly
heated coagulates         at a very high temperature,            and  perhaps    never
 forms distinct flocculi, the coagulation being in the form of                  a  thin
jelly.      Another       portion     of  the same      solution     quickly    heated
coagulates in flocculi at        a  lower temperature.       We have found this
occur with some specimens of serum albumen.                     We are inclined to
explain this        occurrence      on   the    supposition    that the slow        and
continuous      heating in these          cases   causes   some     chemico-physical
change in the albumen itself, whereby its coagulation is affected.
     The Influence on the Coagulation Point of the Degree               of  Concen
                           tration of tlve Albumen itself.
     We find,      as the     result of our experiments,            that in all     the
albuminous solutions we have investigated, the coagulation point is
considerably raised by diluting the solution.               A   very dilute solution
may not coagulate           even    on   boiling,   and egg white, diluted,         but
nevertheless forming           a comparatively       strong solution,      cannot be
coagulated,     as  Sir William Roberts long          ago pointed out.
     In our experiments        we invariably      proceeded    in  the  same way as
regards the rapidity with which the solutions were heated, so                     as to
eliminate any fallacy which might arise on this score.                     The usual
 method     for    determining       coagulation     points  was     adopted.      The
solution was placed in          a test-tube     containing a thermometer which
 could be used as       a  stirrer.    The test-tube was immersed         in  a water-
 bath consisting of two beakers, one within              the other, and      each one
 filled   with cold tap water.             The water-bath was heated by a
 Bunsen, the flame of which was kept always at the same height, and
 so arranged that it took some forty minutes for the fluid in the test-
 tube to reach the temperature            of 80° C.     All our experiments       were
 performed in this way,          so  that uniformity     of results was obtained.
 We     are  inclined    to think, however, that the heating process                was
 unnecessarily slow, not only on account of los3 of time, but what is
 more    important, because it permitted changes              to take    place in the
albuminous solution, especially when acids or alkalies were present
in the fluid.

  The Effect   of Dilution   on the Coagulation    Point of Egg Albumen.
   Egg albumen was prepared by cutting up the glairy white of an
egg and squeezing     it through   a linen cloth.   When this was diluted
with   water, the dilute     solutions   were carefully     filtered.    The   egg
albumen was always alkaline           in reaction, but     we decided      not to
neutralise it.
   In the first experiments the        opalescence  of the heated        solution
alone was observed.
   (1) Undiluted egg-white became opalescent at 58° C.
   (2) Egg-white, diluted with one volume of water, became opal
escent at 58"-75 C.
   (3) Egg-white, diluted with two volumes of water, became opal
escent at 59° -75 C.
   (4) Egg-white,      diluted    with   three volumes of water,          became
opalescent    at 60°-5 C.
   (5) Egg-white,      diluted   with four     volumes      of water,     became
                                                *
opalescent    at 61°-75 C.
   In the  second experiment the appearance         of flocculi was noted as
well  as the opalescence.
   Opalescence    appeared     in the undiluted    egg-white at 59°       C, but
did not appear so soon in the diluted portions, occurring about 1° C.
higher for each dilution.
   (1) The undiluted        albumen coagulated with the formation                of
flocculi at 64° C.
    (2) With one volume of water flocculi formed at 65°-5 C.
    (3) With two volumes of water flocculi formed at 69° C.
   (4) With three volumes of water a few flocculi formed at 80°                 C,
the albumen never completely separating out.
   (5) Greater dilutions       showed opalescence,      but flocculi did not
appear.
 The Effect of Dilution on the Coagulation Point of Serum Albumen.
    Serum albumen is said by Hoppe-Seyler            (iii.  p. 232) to become
opalescent at 60°    C,   and to coagulate at 72°-C. to 73°      C,   and Schafer
places  it at 70° C. (4, p. 181).
    Serum albumen was prepared in the following way                : — The serum

magnesium sulphate.               It  would have been       useless   to  dilute this
solution with water, for, in that             case, both the albumen and the
magnesium sulphate would suffer               dilution.     Dilution     was effected
 by the addition of         a  saturated solution of magnesium sulphate.

   The numbers quoted do not give us the correct coagulation points
for diluted solutions of serum albumen           ; they are the coagulation
 points of diluted solutions plus magnesium sulphate, which raises
the coagulation point considerably,          as we shall subsequently      see.
 The experiment only serves to show how coagulation varies with
dilution   of the albumen.       In this experiment fine flocculi appeared
even   in the   more   dilute solutions, and their presence      rendered the
determination of the coagulation point quite easy, even in the most
dilute solutions.
   In order to determine the action of magnesium sulphate, serum
albumen was prepared in another way.
   Blood serum was diluted with two volumes of water, and a stream
of carbon dioxide passed through           it   The precipitate of globulin
was filtered off.     By this method the albumen was obtained mixed
with    a small quantity of globulin ; its presence,       however, did not
prevent the recognition of the point of opalescence         and the coagula
tion point of the albumen.
   (a) The serum albumen became opalescent at 70° C, and coagu
lated in flocculi at 74° 25 C. The coagulation point being raised

water, became opalescent          at 74°,  the opalescence    becoming very
dense at 78° C.       No flocculi   appeared.
   On comparing these figures with those given for serum albumens
in  a saturated solution of magnesium sulphate,          it will be seen that
the former are uniformly lower, the presence of magnesium            sulphate
tending to elevate the coagulation point.           The effect of dilution is
more marked in the case of serum albumen by itself than in that of
serum albumen       iu the saturated magnesium sulphate solution.           In
the first place,   the coagulation becomes very imperfect in the dilute
solutions  ;  in the  second place, the temperature    in the dilute solution
is very much raised.

       The Effect of Dilution on the Coagulation Point of Vitellin.
    The yolks of several eggs were dissolved in                 6 per cent, solution
of sodium chloride and filtered.             The filtrate was poured into      a large
volume of distilled water, the precipitate of vitellin redissolved in
saline solution, reprecipitated in distilled              water, and dissolved       in
5 per cent solution of sodium chloride.                 In this    case the  vitellin,
prepared from six eggs, was dissolved in 300 c.c. of the solution.
In     order to study the effect of dilution, a                5  per cent,  solution
of sodium chloride was           added in all cases.
    (a) The vitellin solution became                opalescent     when    heated    to
80° C, and coagulated at 85° C.
    (6) "When      diluted     with one volume of 5 per cent,             solution of
sodium       chloride, the      vitellin   became     opalescent at 81°      C,    and
coagulated at 85°       -5 C.
    (c)   When     diluted    with two volumes, it            became   opalescent at
 82°   C,   and coagulated      at 86°5 C.
    (fi) When diluted with three volumes,                 it  became   opalescent at
 82° C, and coagulated at 87° C.
     (e) When      diluted with four volumes,            it   became   opalescent     at
 83°   C,   and coagulated      at 88° C.
    The experiment was repeated, giving a result almost precisely the
 same.      It will be noticed that in this proteid the coagulation point
 does not vary to a very considerable extent               with dilution.
   The Effect of Dilution on the Coagulation Point of Serum Globulin.
     The coagulation point of serum globulin is given by Halliburton
  as 75° C. (Reference 6, p. 163).
     In    the first    experiment       the globulin       was precipitated      from
 bullock's blood by magnesium sulphate.                 The precipitate was, after
 washing,      dissolved      in   a   5   per  cent,     solution   of   magnesium
 sulphate.      It   was diluted      with    a 5   per cent,     watery solution of
 magnesium sulphate.            Unfortunately the       opalescence    was not noted
 down.       The flocculi were well marked.

     In   another experiment serum        glohulin was prepared by passing
 a stream of carbon      dioxide through dilute blood serum.             The     pre
 cipitated glohulin was dissolved in         5 per cent, solution      of sodium
 chloride.     The solution of globulin not being of the same strength
 (a  little weaker), and the salt     used for its solution being a different
 one, the coagulation points do not correspond             with  those   obtained
 in the previous experiment.

     (b) Serum albumen, dissolved        in  5 per cent, solution     of sodium
 chloride    and diluted     with   one   volume of a 5 per cent, watery

          Diluted with three volumes,      opalescence commenced        at 79°    C,
and coagulated      at 84° C.    The albumen at this stage had begun to
putrefy, and on repeating the experiments it was found that the
coagulation point was raised about two degrees for (a), (6),              (<•), and
that (d) did not coagulate      even on boiling.
The Effect of Dilution on the Coagulation Point            of Hydrocele Fluid.
    Hydrocele fluid contains the same proteids as are found in blood
plasma,     namely, fibrinogen, serum glohulin, and serum albumen.                In
a case    of chronic hydrocele there may be an almost entire absence
of proteid matter.        The proteid substance when present            varies in
amount, and the coagulation point             varies with it.      On diluting
hydrocele fluid the coagulation point is raised
    (a) Hydrocele fluid became opalescent at 65° C; at 72° C. it
assumed the consistence of a thin jelly which thickened, and at
76" C. flocculi separated     out.

    Another      specimen      of hydrocele fluid, apparently containing              less
proteid     matter, became opalescent           at 70°  C,  and coagulated with the
formation of flocculi at 80"          -5 C.
    A third     specimen      became     opalescent      at 70°   C,   flocculi forming
at   78° C.
                     General Conclusions regarding Dilution.
    In   the case of albumens and globulin                existing in a natural con
dition within         an animal fluid,         such as white        of egg, serum,      or
hydrocele      fluid, the point of opalescence              is gradually     and almost
uniformly     raised by successive         dilutions.     The coagulation point, on
 the other hand, rises rapidly, and the more dilute fluids often refuse
to form flocculi, or even to coagulate at all.
    When      a globulin      is dissolved       in an   artificially   prepared   saline
 solution, both the point of opalescence                 and coagulating point are
uniformly raised         on   diluting     the    solution.     The same appears        to
apply to serum albumen saturated with magnesium                       sulphate.
       77ie Action      of Salts   on the Coagulation        Point of Albumen.
    It   is known       that    the    addition     of many neutral         salts  to   an
albuminous solution has an important action on the temperature at
which it     coagulates.       Some     salts   are stated     to lower and others to
raise the coagulation point.              It  is impossible to explain at present
their action, and          we    have    accordingly commenced             a   somewhat
systematic examination of the question.                    Our results      are far from
complete,     and   will subsequently,         we hope, be more       fully  extended.
    We     have   at present      studied the action of two important salts,
namely, magnesium sulphate and common salt, on the coagulation
points of egg and serum              albumen, vitellin, and globulin, and the
action of these salts has been studied in all degrees of strength up
to complete      saturation.

   Although        we feel that            it    would be quite out of place to attempi
general    conclusions, yet we believe one or two inferences may                                                      be
drawn from the facts that we have gleaned.
   Some        of the facts            we        have already obtained are                         sufficiently
striking to justify us in thinking that                              a   more extended       investigation,
made on similar linus, may throw some                                light on the mutual relation
ship existing between the albuminous and saline molecules                                             when in
solution together.              We are aware of the extreme                             difficulty        of      the
subject, since so little              is   known           as   yet regarding simpler problems,
such   as the    mutual relationships that exist between simple mixtures
of inorganic salts.

elevate   the temperature               of coagulation, such are, common                              salt and
sulphate of magnesium                 ;     others,        such          as   sulphate of copper                and
chloride of barium, lower                  it;    while     a   third series, such           as   sulphate of
sodium and chlorate of potassium,                           have no effect.

very dilute solutions of albumen             ; these  did not    coagulate   at all,
until    after the addition of the salts mentioned.          He  added very small
•quantities of the salts to the albuminous solution, viz., less than one
per    cent.     Had he worked with coagulable            solutions of albumen,
arid had     he added larger quantites of salt, his result would have been
different.      While,   as we  shall afterwards show, these salts        as a rule
raise the point of coagulation, it        is not at all improbable that dilute
uncoagulable solutions of egg albumen may be enabled to coagulate,
when they otherwise would not ; in fact, our results point to this
conclusion.        If so, it is only one of the many facts which indicate
how little     is at present    known as to properties of the albuminous
molecules and the factors which determine their solubilities.
     In   the preceding table we have placed some of our own results.

 occur, has been raised, though often, as in the case of common salt,

     By complete saturation of an albuminous fluid with a neutral
 salt the proteid may be precipitated at the temperature of the
 laboratory.      Thus Hammarsten         has shown      that globulin     may be
 precipitated from serum by the addition of magnesium sulphate.                  In
 this   case the globulin is not converted into a coagulated           proteid, but
 can again be dissolved after the magnesium          sulphate has been diluted.

 sulphate and filtered.        The saturated     solution contained about 100
 per cent      of magnesium sulphate.          In order   to obtain solutions of
  albumen containing a lower percentage              of the salt, the saturated
 solution was diluted with portions of the original albumen.

     It is a point of some interest to discover whether a salt, which, by
its addition to an albuminous solution, raises the temperature at
which coagulation         occurs, will produce the    same result on an albu
minous solution already saturated        with another salt.     This    we have
determined to some extent.
 Effect   of the Addition of various Salts      on the Coagulation     Point of
        Egg Albumen already saturated with Magnesium Sulphate.
     Egg albumen was diluted with two volumes of water, and saturated
 with magnesium sulphate. The solution was filtered, and it was
 found on heating to become            opalescent at 79°    C,    coagulating at
 81°-75 C.        The salts added,      most   of which    have already been
 studied in respect to their action on the coagulation point of egg
 albumen (Table I.), are seen to lower the coagulation point of egg
 albumen saturated with magnesium sulphate.

      On comparing this table with that on page 370, it will be noted,
  first, that those salts which on Table L do not raise the coagulation
  point of egg albumen to any great extent, NaCl, KC1, K2S04, and
  ^fa^SOj (Varenne), do not lower the coagulation             point (Table II.)

it in Table II.          It   is possible still more to lower the coagulation
point by the addition of larger quantities of the latter salts, until
one can precipitate the albumen by double saturation at the tempera
ture of the laboratory.            On the other hand, the addition of               large
quantities of NaCl and Na2S04 exerts very little action.

               Tentative Conclusions regarding the Action                             of Salts.
     (1)     A     salt may raise the temperature                       of coagulation           if   present
in   a       certain percentage          ;    at another percentage                 it     may      lower it.
Thus common                 salt raises the coagulation                     points of both vitellin
and serum globulin                 when           present        in moderately small quantity.
Large quantities lower the coagulation point.

which by               itself   would        raise    the coagulation               point,     the coagu
lation point may in this case be lowered.                                     It    appears,        too,    that
salts which are most active in raising the coagulation point are most
active in lowering              it,    when added to         a     solution already saturated by
another salt.

       Statement     as to whether    it  is possible   to speak     of the  Specific,
                         Coagulation Point of an Albumen.
    From what has been already said, it is obvious that it is                             a
 difficult and     perhaps a valueless       task to attempt to determine what
 may be termed          the  "specific     coagulation point" of an albumen.
The      coagulation      point    varies     with     the    rapidity      of   heating,
 with    the concentration of the           fluid, with its       reaction,    and with
the saline        substances    present.       All    that   one     can   say   is that,
under      such    and   such conditions,        an albumen coagulates            at such
a temperature.           It  is  probably hardly         possible      to  obtain    even
two albumens under              such     similar    conditions      that their      coagu
lation      points    may    with    advantage       be   compared.         The    nearest
approach to this would perhaps be to dissolve                   a  certain weight, say
both of vitellin        and   another globulin        such    as   serum    globulin,    in
the   same volume of           salt solution.       The coagulation points may,
in this     case,   with   advantage      be compared.          But what would           bo
the value of        the   coagulation points so obtained for purposes                    of
comparison with serum            or egg albumen dissolved in water?                    The
coagulation points quoted by previous writers cannot be taken in
any sense      as   absolute    values    for the albumen named,              modifying
conditions having,        as  a  rule, been totally        disregarded.       The same
may be said of our own results, for the percentage                     strengths of the
albuminous solutions used by us were in no                     case   determined with
any care.       Although      the forms of        the   curves     represented     in the
charts are not affected           by   this,   their    altitudes     in  the   scale    of
temperatures may be so to some considerable extent.

    So far we have been dealing with albumen in its natural condition,
or mixed and possibly combined with neutral salts which we had
added.
    The solutions were alkaline, and,            as we   found, when dealing with
the natural albuminous solution, difficult                to coagulate,     especially if
in  a dilute    condition.      Let   us now consider the           coagulation point
of an albuminous solution           to  which an acid        has been       added.      On
adding an acid to an albumen solution, the coagulation is rendered,
as every one knows, more easy, and              it occurs at a lower temperature.
The very dilute solutions, uncoagulable                  in   the alkaline      solution,

are at once coagulated              after the addition of a few drops of weak
acid.     No      one has brought this out more                   clearly than       Dr Halli
burton in a most suggestive  paper (Reference 6), which will pre
sently be quoted in relationship to fractional coagulation.   He
showed that the coagulation point of serum albumen varies with
the amount of acid present,                  the greater     the quantity           added,     the
lower the coagulation               point,     until finally       coagulation        could     be
produced at the temperature of the laboratory.                               If    then the co
agulating point depended                 on the two factors, heat and the amount
of acidity, it seemed to him a natural deduction, that, on keeping
one of these, the acidity, a constant quantity,                     it might        be possible
to separate by fractional             coagulation two or more albumens mixed
together,         and having        different coagulation           points.        He investi
gated     serum      albumen, and found that              if it    be neutralised        by the
addition of some drops of a                    2   per cent, solution of acetic acid,
and     if,   further,   it   be rendered slightly acid by the addition                  of one
drop of the dilute acetic acid to seventy-five drops of the albuminous
solution, then        it   coagulates    at 70° to 71°     C,     and   if   this coagulum be
filtered off, and the solution again                  brought to the same degree of
acidity,      a   coagulum occurs the second time at 77° to 78° C.                       If this
coagulum          be filtered off and the filtrate acidified as before, a                    third
coagulum may be produced at 82° C.                          Dr Halliburton considers
 that the         serum       albumen, originally       regarded        as   one     proteid, in
 reality consists of three.
    MM. Corin and Berard have followed this                          process of fractional
 coagulation, applying            it   to egg-white.       This     substance,       commonly
 held to consist of albumen and globulin, they believe to consist of
 three albumens and two globulins.
    They neutralise some egg-white,                   slightly acidify       it,   and raise    its
 temperature,         until     opalescence        appears; then they keep             the tem
 perature       constant for      a    considerable     time —an        hour or even more.
 They filter off the coagula, re-acidify to the same degree, raise                             the
 temperature         until    opalescence occurs, and then after more prolonged
 heating flocculi again appear.
      In this     way they have succeeded, as already stated, in fractionating
 five proteids.
      Without doubting that               it   may    be possible to fractionate some
 proteids, nevertheless            the    results of our own work, and many of

the facts frankly stated by Dr Halliburton, seemed to throw some
doubt upon the correctness of his deductions in the case of serum
albumen, and this applied with equal force to the experiments con
ducted by MM. Corin and Berard on egg albumen.
   Our previous experiments have shown that, in alkaline solution,
the   more dilute a solution               is,   the higher       is   its coagulation point, and
we have           found that we could                never completely precipitate                       any
albumen         at the temperature at which                      flocculi first appeared.               The
reason of this            is   very simple;           as       soon     as    a   solution begins to
coagulate, the remnant, still soluble,                           is    practically       a   more dilute
solution        of the same proteid, and must be heated two or three
degrees      more before       it   will begin         to precipitate.              In this    case, also,
the coagulating proteid will leave another soluble remnant, coagul-
able at      a    still higher temperature, and                       so on.        In    fact, we      may
venture to make             this general statement — In order                       to coagulate        com
pletely any proteid            it   must     be heated           to that temperature            at which
its   most      dilute     solutions       are coagulable.               We        have      not made so
systematic an investigation upon the effect, on its coagulating point,
 of diluting acid solutions of albumen, butVe have                                   assured ourselves
 that the         more dilute       solutions coagulate                 at   a    higher temperature.
 One out of several experiments may be quoted the following                                         :—
      Some egg albumen was diluted                         with two volumes of water and
 carefully neutralised.              It    was then brought                  to the same degree of
 acidity     as   is    recommended         for fractional coagulation,                   1   cubic centi
 metre of       a   2   per cent, solution of acetic acid being added to 75 cubic
 centimetres of the albumen.                      This solution              was found to coagulate
 at 53° C.
      When diluted with              one volume of water,                    acidulated to the same
 degree,     it   coagulated       at 54° C.
      With three volumes of                                coagulated at 58° C.
                                                          it
                                           water,
                                                    it it
      With      seven volumes of water,                    coagulated         at 62° C.
      With fifteen volumes of water,                           coagulated at 68° C.
      It   is   seen, therefore, that dilution                   has the effect of raising the
 coagulation point             a   great    many degrees, the more dilute albumen
 requiring        a   much higher temperature for its separation.                               This may
 be shown             in the most striking manner by heating                                 some   of the
 acidulated water to between 60° and 70° C.                             ;     and dropping in some
 acidulated egg albumen               it    at first dissolves.                Now divide the solu            -

tion into two portions,    A and B, and heat A to 75° C, and keep B
at the   original temperature.  A will coagulate, showing that although
in too dilute a solution to coagulate                        below 70°          C, it      could neverthe
less coagulate,            provided its temperature be raised.                              B will remain
clear,   but,      if   more      albumeu be dropped into                        it,   a    point     will    be
reached, at which            it    will    cease to dissolve, and then                     it   will separate
out in flocculi.
     Here then, without going any further, one has come across an
observation which,            if   it   does not explain all the facts described under
the bead of fractional                    coagulation, must at any rate account                              for
some of them.
     Both Dr Halliburton                   and MM. Corin                  and     Berard found              that
after coagulation the nitrate, which they separated                                         from the clot,
was less acid than            it   was before coagulation had occurred,                             the latter
observers         finding that,           as   a   rule,    it    was actually alkaline.                Here,
again,   is   a   factor which we cannot afford                           to lose sight of.            If    the
coagulation point            is   lowered by acidity,              as    all persons are agreed, one
would expect that,                while coagulation               is    proceeding, and while pari
passu the acidity            is   decreasing,         that the decrease of acidity would                      at
last   bring the           coagulation — at that temperature — to                               a   standstill
In this       case ono would               expect,         that on re-acidifying                 to the same
degree, another crop               of coagula           might fall at the same temperature
as   did the first crop.
     Dr Halliburton           does not mention any such coagulation, although
undoubtedly         it     occurs, and           we have found            it    on repeating his ob
servations,       but MM. Corin and Berard                              evidently          find that one      is
produced,         and   in   consequence              they heat the albumen for an hour or
more before filtering off the coagulum.                                After this time, they found
that the albumen never                         gave    a    second       coagulation at the same
temperature.            We cannot but conclude from this that their experi
ments    clearly indicate that                     the albuminous              solutions with which
they     worked          must      have         been       very    materially          changed by the
temperature,           nor   is   it   at all improbable that very material changes
may occur         in   a   solution of egg albumen kept in an acid solution at
a   high temperature              for over an hour           ;    in one of their quoted experi
ments fractionation               lasted over six hours.
     We may,        we     think,      make this statement,                and one fully borne out
by our own experiments,                   that during coagulation in an acid medium

1888-89.]       Haycraft and Duggan on Coagulation                   by  Heat.     383
the coagulation point is being continually                 raised, both   in virtue of
the albumen becoming             more dilute and iu virtue of its becoming
less acid   ;   these   factors bring the coagulation to a standstill, but,
after filtering off the coagulum,         if   the fluid    be brought      back to its
original    degree     of acidity, and      heated     to   the same temperature,
coagula will again          form, unless the albumen has undergone some
physico-chemical change.
    It follows, too, that it is impossible to separate two albumens from
one another by heat             coagulation,     unless,    during    the process    of
coagulation, the degree of acidity is kept uniform by the addition of
small quantities of fresh acid,          and unless the coagulation point of
the most dilute solution of one of the albumens present be below the
coagulation       point of the other albumen.               We    became    more   con
vinced of this, when repeating in          detail the experiments on fractional
coagulation.        After keeping     an albuminous          solution, either egg or
serum albumen, at the temperature               at which flocculi appear, for five
or six minutes, and then filtering off the flocculi, we found that fresh
flocculi appeared, when the filtrate had been re-acidified, and again
raised to the same temperature.              Two or      three crops might be thus
removed in the case of egg-white.               Keeping      up the samo degree of
acidity, and raising the temperature,            we w-ere able to get other crops
of albumen.          We     were  struck, however, by the            fact that,   while
dealing with the more dilute albumen, the coagulation took place
with difficulty, and it         was longer delayed.           This  was particularly
the case with egg-albumen.            If  the fluid filtrate from the coagulated
flocculi be divided into two parts, and one portion raised gradually
in temperature, opalescence followed by the formation of llocculi
 will appear. If the- other portion be raised in temperature and
 kept for,    say,  three minutes at a temperature one or two degrees
 below the temperature at which               opalescence      appeared    in the first
 portion,     it will     become    opalescent      and     perhaps    form    flocculi.
 We found, in         fact,   that it was impossible to get the subsequent
 coagulation at definite points,       as  indicated by the previous observers,
 for the coagulation point           depended       upon the way in which the
 operations had been carried out.            This    was especially the case, when
 dealing    with     egg albumen, and we have               little doubt that MM.
 Corin and Berard, working with careful                  method,    invariably raised
 their temperatures to points which               perhaps their first experiments

384                      Proceedings        of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                                         [sess.
had suggested.                       They, no doubt, produced coagula,                             but, had they
tried the experiment, they would have obtained them equally well
at a lower temperature                          provided they had raised the temperature
more slowly.                    It   is not difficult         to fractionate egg albumen ten or
twelve times.
      Another point that struck                             us was             the smaller            and        smaller
amount of coagulation produced,                               as the temperature                  of the solution
was         raised            and    successive        crops       produced.                This      was    noticed
by      Dr Halliburton in the                        case of egg albumen.                    It   is certainly the
case       with          egg albumen.            This, of course, in itself renders                         it highly
probable                 that       we    are     dealing      in           both     cases        only with         one-
albumen, the more dilute solutions of which are alone coagulated
at the higher                   temperatures.            Even           supposing that the y                     serum
albumen of                    Dr Halliburton, of which                        he     " in      some     case       only
found           a    trace," and which coagulates                           at 82°    C,    is different from a
and        (3   serum         albumen, found in greater                       quantity,        and coagulating
at     lower temperatures,                      yet fractional              coagulation           could not        give
us the means of proving this.                            One cannot compare the coagulating
points of                a    dilute with        a   strong solution of two albumens,                               and
presuming that y serum                           albumen is        a   dilute solution of an albumen
differing from a and                       /?,   yet its coagulation point would be lower
than 82° C. in                  a   solution of corresponding strength.
      It    is,     of   course, possible that serum albumen may consist of more
than one albumen, although                             it     is   probable, from what we have

at the same degree                    of concentration — at or about                        the same tempera
ture.             Other         methods          may enable            the physiologist               to separate
these,      if      they exist, from one another, and no methods have                                            in the
past        yielded           such       valuable      results         as    those    in which separation
has bpen obtained by the addition of neutral salts.                                               Dr Halliburton
has by this moans tried to separate the a,                                     j3,   and   y   serum albumens
from one another, and frankly states that he has failed to do so

  In conclusion, we                         may       state    that          the method of fractional
coagulation could only lie of service when the coagulation points
of the albumens present are widely separated from each other.                                                        In
reality, fractional coagulation has been for                                   a     long time in use, and
one        of the few cases in which, as far                                 as we can         see,   it    is   at all

 Serum globulin              is precipitated at the atmospheric temperature on
 acidifying by              a stroam     of carbon dioxide, or by the addition                           of
 weak acetic acid.               This precipitation             is not a complete              one, how
 ever, as Hammarsten                   has shown.           The reason       is,   that, at the atmo
 spheric temperature,             part of the globulin remains in solution.

         The interval which            elapses between tapping              a      muscle or tendon
and the resulting               movement of the limb has been estimated                                by
many            observers    — Burckhardt,          Tschirjieu,        Waller,        Brissaud        and
Francois Franck, Eulenberg, De Watteville, &c. — but the                                           precise
signification of these so-called                   reflexes     is   not yet fully understood.
What follows            is   intended to add to our knowledge of this subject.
         The observations       were made on          a     patient in the Boyal Infirmary,
aged 26, who, as the result of                    a   blow on the left side of the neck,
sustained           three years

quadriceps feraoris,     and left gastrocnemius        ;  (3) marked clonus of
the left ankle and left knee-joints ; and (4) to a less extent impaired
voluntary motor power of the right leg, with increased ankle and
knee jerks nnd clonus.
    Knee Jerk. — The      method    of recording this, which           I  followed,
was to connect     two recording tambours, the first with           a tube   having
a  flexible extremity, which could be held over the patellar tendon,
and through which the tendon could be tapped;                  the second     with   a
receiving tambour, the button of which was held in contact with the
leg.    The first recording tambour indicated on             a  rapidly revolving
cylinder the instant at which the tendon was tapped, and the second
the moment that the limb began to move.               A chronograph, vibrating
 100 per second, enabled      the interval between       the tap and the move
ment to be ascertained.        Care was taken that the tubes connected
with the tambours wore of the same length.
    In both limbs the time        was    found    to be about '06 second — a
rather longer interval than that stated by most other observers to be
the case at any rate in health      (see   Tracing I.).
    Ankle. Jerk. — To   ascertain  this the flexible end of the tube con
nected with     the first recording tambour was            held in contact       with
the tendo-Achilles,     whilst the button of the receiving tambour was
held in contact with the ball of the great toe.              In  the case of both
limbs the time which elapsed between the tap on the tendon and
the resulting movement       was about '08 second (see Tracing            II.).
    Plantar   Reflex.
                      — This   was ascertained      in the right leg only ; the
cutaneous    sensibility of the left being        so  much impaired, that its
plantar rellex was practically non-existent.             The method followed
was to substitute for the flexible end of the tube connected with the
first recording tambour an ordinary receiving tambour,               to the  button
of which was fixed a pin point.            The button of the other receiving
tambour was held in contact with the lower end of the thigh.                      The
interval between the prick thus applied to the sole of the foot and
the resulting movement was '16 second.
     Wrist Jerk. — To ascertain this the flexible end of the tube con
nected    with  the first recording tambour was laid on the tendon                  of
the supinator longus of the left arm, and the button of the receiving
tambour was held over the metacarpal            region of the hand.         The tap
applied to the tendon through the tube readily produced the desired

movement, and the interval was found to be '05 second.                        It was
observed,     further, that with each tap of the supinator longus tendon
a  contraction of the biceps         muscle occurred.      This   was also timed
by means of tambours employed in            a similar way, the button of the
receiving one being held in contact with the middle of the muscle.
The interval between         the tap on the      supinator longus tendon and
the contraction       of the biceps     was found     to be -045       second    (see
Tracing     III.).
    Ankle Clonus.— The method by which this was timed was the
ordinary one, and is so well known that it need not be described.
The     rate of the clonus was found to be in botli legs about 7 per
second (see Tracing IV.).
    Knee Clonus. — This could be easily induced in both legs by
drawing      down the patella;,      and  was   timed in the ordinary way.
The    rate was found to he about      8J  or 9 per second (see Tracing         IV.).
    From     these   data  the   following conclusions        may,    I   think,   be
drawn     : —
    I. That    (as has been    pointed out by other observers) the interval
between the tap on the tendon or muscle and the resulting move
ment is too short to enable us to regard            these jerks     as   being ordi
nary reflexes      in which     sensory   nerves,  nerve     centres,    and motor
nerves are together       concerned.       Thus in this patient the plantar
reflex was found to be '16 second, and the Achilles                    tendon jerk
•08    second.     Were both of these similarly          produced reflexes, the
latter would have taken         as long, or even    a longer,   interval to occur
instead of a much shorter one.
    II.   That yet these muscle or tendon jerks cannot be regarded                 as
direct contractions.       In  evidence of this is to be noticed —
    (a) That the interval between         the tap and the resulting contrac
tion differs in different muscles,         being greater in the         case  of the
gastrocnemius than in the quadriceps femoris,                and   greater    in the
quadriceps femoris than in the supinator longus.               Were they direct
we should expect the interval to be the same or nearly the same in
all.
    (I further found in     this patient that with single induction shocks,
as stimuli      applied directly to the muscles,        the contraction of the
gastrocnemius took place more rapidly than that of the quadriceps.
In the tracings given the interval         was  in the   case  of the quadriceps

about -05 second, and of the gastrocnemius about                               "03    second        (see
Tracings V. and         VI.).
    (//) That when the tendon of the supinator                             longus was tapped
contraction occurred             in the biceps         as   well, and that the contraction
of the biceps preceded                 that of the supinator longus.                   This       could
only occur     a-s   the result of some reflex in the cord.
     From these special            conclusions the general                 one which         I    think
may    be drawn         is,     that these muscle            and tendon jerks are really
reflexes, but reflexes of              a   nature much          more   simple than the ordi
nary ones, in which sensory nerves, nerve centres, and motor nerves
are concerned.              Looking        upon       muscle,    motor nerve,         and central
nerve cell as being composed                 alike of masses of irritable protoplasm,
and    remembering that the masses of irritable                             protoplasm           which
compose     these       can conduct equally                 well in either          direction,          we
can suppose          that the stimulus of the tap                  applied     to     the muscle,
directly, or indirectly through its tendon, produces                               its contraction
only after the impulse                 so generated         has traversed      through muscle
and motor nerve fibre to nerve cell, and down again to muscle along
the same nerve fibre.                  In this way,         ceteris paribus,       the longer the
distance between            a   muscle      and   its nerve       centre the        longer       will   be
the interval between the tap and the resulting contraction.                                  This        is,
of course, borne out by these observations, the ankle jerk taking the
longest and the wrist             jerk     the shortest time to occur, the knee                    jerk
occupying an intermediate position.                          But the fact that contraction
of the biceps occurred when the tendon of the supinator longus was
tapped,    and that the contraction of the former preceded                             that of the
latter muscle, denotes             that the impulse generated                 in   muscle,        motor
nerve, and nerve cell, as the result of the tap, may be reflected                                  from
the nerve cell along other                  nerve fibres.        We must conclude, how
ever, that for this rellex, as for                a   reflex along the same nerve fibre,
a   much shorter time             is   required than for one in which the afferent
impulse travels along an ordinary sensory nerve.
     The phenomena of clonus bear out this view.                               Clonus        may be
regarded     as   being     a   series of    jerks     or contractions, each    jerk or con
traction acting        as   the stimulus to the one              which follows.    The fact,
then, that (as shown by the observations made on this patient, and
as demonstrated by myself at greater length in previous paper)* the    a

rapidity of clonus in    a  given muscle varies inversely with its distance
from its centre     in the    cord, the ankle being slower than the knee,
the knee than the elbow,           &c, indicates that in        the  production of
each jerk, nerve cell and nerve fibres are concerned              equally with the
muscle, and that the length of the motor nerve fibres seems to be
the element of most importance in conditioning the rapidity of the
clonus.

  Two rules, Grunert                 says, have          been given for the construction                              of

     Before proceeding further                       it is important             to note that                    Grunen
here     establishes          a    more          definite      theorem than he proposed                                     to
himself, viz., the theorem of Rothe                             (III.      7).      If    he attains greater
simplicity     it   is   in part due to the fact that instead of taking any two
indices for interchange,                k    and     r   say, he takes           k   and      1.
  To prove now that the function constructed in accordance with
Cramer's rule will satisfy the requisite conditions, suffices to show                    it
by means of this theorem                          that on making any one of the n                                       —   1
specified     sets of substitutions                  the function will be transformed into
one consisting of pairs                 of       terms which         annul each other                   ;    in other
words, to prove Vandermonde's                                 theorem regarding the effect                                  of
making two indices alike.                           This      is    done  ;      and then          it       is shown
how    xK     can be got by interchanging and xi in all the given   xK
equations, the first step being of course to establish the fact that
the denominator of                xK   and the denominator of                     xx     only differ in sign.
     Bezout's rule of 1764              is    next taken up, and shown to be identical
in   effect    with Cramer's.                    The proof, by reason                     of the recurring
character      of the former,               is    inductive     ;    that      is    to say,       it       is   demon
strated that,    if      the two rules agree in the case of n unknowns, they
must also agree in the case of n +                             1.    Paraphrasing              the proof, but
taking for shortness' sake                       the case where n =                  4,   we say that                 it    is
agreed      that both rules give in this case the signed permutations
              1234,       - 1243,           +1423,         -4123,          -   1324,          +.   .    .
Now for       the case where n =                 5   Bezout's rule directs that to the end
of each of these permutations,                        e.g.,    the permutation                 - 4123,            a   5     is
to be put, and asserts that the result                               - 41235           will    be one             of the
desired     permutations with its proper sign.                                   That     it   is      a    permuta
tion of the first five integers                       is    manifest, and since the number
of inversions in 41235                      is   necessarily the same as the number in
4123, its sign           is   correct       according to Cramer's rule.                            In order to
obtain four other permutations, Bezout's rule then proceeds to bid
us   shift the      5     one place and                alter the sign,               shift the          5        another
place and alter the sign again, and so on.                                 The result          is
                      +   41253, -41523,                    +45123,            -54123.
In   regard     to this,          it   is   clear    as before           that permutations                       of     the

f5rst five integers have been got, and that the altering of the sign
simultaneously with the shifting of the 5 is in accordance with
Cramer's rule, because every time that the 5 is moved one place to
the left the number of inversions is increased by unity. The only
question remaining is as             to whether           all the permutations                          are thus
obtainable ; and as it is          seen that each of the 24 permutations of
the first four integers gives rise                   to 5 permutations of the first five,

 a study of Jacobi's memoirs on the subject.   Like these it mainly
 concerns determinants of the special form afterwards individualised
 by the term axisymmetric                 ;    and, indeed, it is notable as being the
 first memoir in which         a special name is given to a special form, the
 expression "determinants            sym^triques" being repeatedly used for the
 particular determinants referred to.

   The analytical portion of the essay is to a considerable extent
identical with              the original memoir.                                      In       so far as there is a differ
ence, the change is towards greater simplicity, less seemingly aimless
plunging into widely extensive theorems, and in general a better
and more attractive style of exposition. Less space too is given to
it, — not      even half what is occupied by the portion on the tetrahedron,
the    main aim now being to urge on mathematicians the capabilities
of the analysis in               its application to geometry.
   The matters falling to be noted                                             as not          having been given in the
original memoir                are few               in number and of little                                           importance.                           In

exposition,     confessedly borrowed from Gergonne's paper of                     1813,
and six     pages of extracts from Laplace's original               memoir of 1772.
As forming part of a popular text-book, it probably did more service
in bringing the theory to the notice of mathematicians than a
memoir in a recondite serial publication                 could have done      ; and we
certainly     know     that Sylvester,        who     afterwards    did   so much to
advance the theory, expresses himself indebted to it.

   Sylvester     was apparently first brought             into contact with deter
minants      while investigating        the subject of the elimination             of x
between two equations of the             m.a>  and   nth degrees.    At the close of
a paper on this subject (Phil. Mag., xv. p. 435) he                         "
                                                                   says — I trust to
be able to present the readers of this magazine with a direct and
symmetrical       method       of    eliminating       any number       of    unknown
quantities between any number of equations of any degree, by a
newly invented process of symbolical multiplication, and the use of
compound symbols of notation."                These last words, indicative of the
method, exactly describe the matter dealt with in the paper we
have   now come to, and          as  will soon be seen, the functions which
are the outcome        of the    said " compound symbol " of operations are
 determinants.

up of one or more terms,                             consisting solely of linear arguments of

   These special zeta-ic products being reached, the rest of the paper
is taken up with          an account of some of their properties,                                           and      the
application of them to the discussion of simultaneous linear equations.
Some of the matter may be passed over                                         as   being already familiar to
us, although      its earlier appearances                              were        certainly made in             a   less
picturesque dress.               The lirst really fresh theorem concerns the zotaic
multiplication of         a determinant £PD (Oabr . . . I) by those symmetric
functions of a,      b,   c, . . . , /, which we would denote by
                                          2a, 2a6,          H.abr,          ....

 The limitation   made     upon the arguments           of the base would       seem
 to imply that the theorem         only concerned determinants of a very
special  kind.    Such, however, is not the           case.     A special example
in  more modern    notation will bring out its true character.              Let   the
determinant chosen be

 of    the equations of the system.                           The      theorem        is enunciated as
  follows (p. 40):—

        It is rather curious tliat Sylvester overlooks the fact that the legitimate
  cquatement of two zeta-ic products implies an identity altogether independent

This is what Sylvester's third rule would              give.      His second rule        is
simply a case of the third, viz., where              r=l ;     and his first rule is
another     case,   viz., where  r = 0.     Had     he followed        the order   of  his
 former paper, he would have called the third rule his                         " leading

     Just  as  Jacobi (1835) brought determinants to hear on Bezout's
 abridged method of eliminating x from two equations of the n*
 degree, so did his fellow-professor Richelot, in treating of the other
 method of elimination, Euler's and Bezout's,               discovered in the same
 year (1764).        Euler's  method,    it will    be  remembered,         consists      in
 transforming       the problem into the simpler one of eliminating                   a set
 of unknowns from a sufficient              number of linear            equations   ;  and
 Eichelot iu a few lines (p. 227) points out that this may, of course,
 be done by equating to zero the determinant of the system of equa

 portion of the paper.

  originally made known by the author, it was merely in the form                          of

mode in which it was obtained, still this first published description
of the   mode by Richelot deserves                                 to be put on record.                            The whole

and finally eliminate                from these          four       equations             x3,    x2,     x1,    by

explanation in Sylvester's paper, is not literally true.                                    Richelot may
have meant by it that Sylvester's result implied that the problem
had been transformed as stated.

  After the             appearance       of the special            papers             on this subject by
Jacobi, Sylvester,           and Richelot, a review of the whole                                matter could
not but bs           a desideratum.              This   was       supplied by Cauchy in the
singularly         clear   and able            memoir which we                    have     now         reached.
After    an        introduction         of four         is an account (1) of

and (4) of          a   method* by means of the differences of the roots of
the equations.
  Euler and Bezout's method is shown to lead to the same deter
minant        as   Sylvester's, and the cause is made apparent.                                        Cauchy 's

    In returning     to extend the method,            here and generally afterwards
 called " dialytic," Sylvester takes occasion to say that " the principle
 of the rule will be found correctly stated by Professor llichelot of
 Kbnigsberg       in  a   late   number of         Crelle's     Journal."         It    may  be
 noted, too, that he now for the first time uses the word ihtvrminant.
    Only the first and last of the four examples need be given,                          as the
 subject   strictly belongs to the application rather than the theory of
  determinants.       Even     these,    however,       will      suflice     to    show the
  masterly grip which Sylvester had of his own method.

obtains       it       very ingeniously                 by writing the given equations in the
form
(Ax      + B'z     +C'y)x          +    (By    +     C'x     +    A'z)y   + (Cz      +A'y      +   B'x)z =       0   \

and then eliminating x,                       y,   z.      The work         is   not continued further.
     We may            ourselves        note,           in conclusion, that              the fourth         example
includes          in   a    sense the three                  others,      but that       it    does not follow
therefrom          that by giving                    the requisite             special values to the co
efficients in the result of the general example,                                     we should obtain the
results for the particular examples                                  in the forms already                   reached.
Indeed,       it       is   on account of this apparent non-agreement                                       that the
dialytic method               is   valuable to the theory of determinants, some very
remarkable identities being arrived at by its aid.                                             An explanation
is   also thus afforded                of the trouble we have taken to elucidate its
history.

doubt, however, that it was the second fact alone, — in other words,
the discoveries of Jacobi, Sylvester, and Richelot, — which influenced
the. veteran Cauchy to return to a subject practically untouched by
him for thirty           years.
    The opening part of the paper                        is,   of course, necessarily old matter.
One thing to be noted                      is   that     Cauchy tacitly discards the term
determinant, which he was the means of introducing, using uniformly
the more general expression fonction aiternee instead. Another                                                         is
that     he adopts the rules of signs which makes use of the number of
interchanges.            From this his own peculiar rule of signs                              is        deduced,
and made the starting point for the fresh investigation which forms
the main portion of the paper.                           The exposition of his rule, which
differs from that of 1812,                   is   worthy of       a   little attention, both on its
own account and because otherwise the matter following would be

groups ("groupes"),               by reason of the system of                     pairing; that                    is   to
say, since an index              is   found paired along with one index and not
with     another,        there    arises        the possibility            of looking          upon those
which      happen        to be paired             with    one another as belonging                            to the
same family group.                Thus, attending to the first                   a   of   the term, we
see that       1   and   0   belong to the same group, and as on scanning the
rest of the term, we find neither of them associated with any other
index, wo conclude that the group                         is    binary     (" un groupe binaire").
Again, we                that                paired with                  with      with   and

3   is   seen to be paired              with       3,   and thus forms          a    group by itself.
Now,     if    we wish to             find    how many interchanges of                         the            second

given cyclical species which exist in any determinant of the «tt order

permutation into the specified               groups,         viz., first       /    groups of    on*

rule, however,   each term of the species                  will, in this way,         be obtained

muted     among themselves          in   every possible way, so may the g binary
groups, the    h  ternary groups, &c.                 Further, with like immunity to
the term,    each separate         group may be written                    in   as  many ways         as
there    are  indices in it,- — the group (4, 5, 6), for example,                                 being
safely changeable into (5, 6, 4) or                     (6, 4, 5).        The number, there
fore, of different permutations of 0,                   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,        which will give

found       him, indeed, in almost constant employment of the functions.
In     the memoir now reached, however, we have still stronger evidence
of    his interest in the subject, and of his opinion               as to  its importance.
Ivnowing of          no succinct and        logically arranged       exposition of their
properties readily         accessible     to mathematicians, he           deliberately set
himself       the task of preparing a memoir to supply the want.                          In   hi.s
 few    words of preface he says           :—
             "Sunt quidem notissimi Algorithmi,                   qui aequationum             lin-

         eorum proprietates praecipuas,             ita breviter enarratas            atque     in

         earum in gravissimis quaestionibus                Analyticis     usum.         Scilicet
         illae proprietates quamvis elemen tares non omnes ita tritae sunt,
         ut quas indemonstratas relinquere deceat,               et  valde molestura           est

         in aliis commentationibus ad hanc recurrere possim                    ;   neutiquam
         vero mihi propono totam illam materiam                  absolvere."
      While Jacobi        was aware, as we have            already partly seen, of the
  labours of Cramer, Bezout, Vandermonde, Laplace, Gauss, and Binet,
  his   main      source    of inspiration       is    Uauchy.      Of all the writers
  since Cauchy's time, indeed, he is the first who gives evidence                               of
  having     read and mastered        the famous        memoir of 1812.            It  scarcely
  needs be said,        however, that his own individuality and powerful
  grasp are manifest throughout the whole exposition.
      At the      outset   there is     a   reversal    of former orders           of things       ;
   Cramer's rule of signs for          a   permutation and Cauchy's rule being
  led up to by       a series  of propositions         instead  of one of them             being
   made an      initial convention or definition.              This implies, of          course,
   that   a new definition of       a  signed permutation is adopted,                 and that
   conversely this definition must have appeared                  as a deduced         theorem
   in any exposition          having      either    of these     rules    as     its starting
   point.
      The new definition          has its source        in Cauchy, and        rests on the
   well-known       agreement      as  to a definite mode          of forming the pro
   duct   P   of the differences       of an ordered series of quantities.                  This

    As for the permutations which                 are called reciprocal      they arc,
exactly those whose existence we have seen noted hy Kothe, and
called    hy    him    "verwandte         Permutationen."        Jacohi's  definition,
however, presents        them in a slightly          different light, the property
involved in it heing readily deducible from Kothe's. The latter's
illustrative example was, as may be seen on looking back,

 Now    the performance of either           A  on  B or B on     A*   gives rise to
                           1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10      ,
the original arrangement           :   consequently     A and B satisfy Jacobi's
definition.      The propositiou (h) is also Rothe's.
    After    these propositions, as already intimated, the subject of other
rules of sigus is taken up, the first rule considered being Cramer's.
 Since in the product          of differences       corresponding to any permu
 tation every factor in which an index is preceded by a smaller
 index would require the sign-factor             -  1 to be annexed to it in order
 that the said product might be transformed into the original
product of differences, it is clear that the determination of the class
to which the permutation belongs is reduced to counting the number
of such inversions. But the pairs of indices in the product of
differences corresponding to the given permutation are exactly the
pairs of indices to         be examined in applying             Cramer's rule.      The
identity of the two        rules is thus apparent.                             (m. 33)
     To the demonstration             Jacobi adds " quam regulam olim                cel.
 Cramer dedit ill.        Laplace       demonstravit."      The     last assertion is
notable for two reasons          :   first, because the rule like Jacobi's         own
 is incapable of proof being             a definition,    postulate, or convention
 according to the mode in which it is expressed                  : secondly, because
an examination of Laplace's memoir shows that there is no ground
 for the statement           The fitness of the rule for the determination of
 the  signs of the numerators and denominators of                  the unknowns in
 a set of simultaneous linear equations may of course be demonstrated,
 and perhaps this was in Jacobi's mind, but prior to the. statement
 the abstract subject of permutations had alone been discussed.

      In   the compounding of reciprocal permutations the order is immaterial.
 This is  the exception   hinted at in (d).

      The other rule of signs dealt with is Cauchy's, in which permnti-
  tion-cycles are counted            instead     of inversions.         The existence             ci
 such cycles is the first point to be established,                   that is to say, it         has
 to be shown that any permutation of                   1 2 3 . . .    n may be obtained
from any other by the performance of one or mere cyclical permuta
 tions.       Let 3271654 be the permutation sought,* and 2647513 the
 permutation from which it is to             be  derived.      Placing the former under
 the latter, thus

  we see that       2  has to be changed into 3, then seeking 3                 in   the upper
 line we      see  that it has to be changed           into 4, similarly that          4 has to
 be changed          into  7, 7  into   1, 1   into  5, 5    into 6, and      6   into    2, the
 element       with which we started.              Now     the proof       turns upon         the
 simple fact that the elements                in the two lines being exactly                  the
 same, by following a string of changes like this we are bound sooner
 or later to reach in the second             line the element         we started within
 the first.       It   may be that as here oue cycle
 suffices for the second          transformation      ;  but    if not,   as  in   the case of
 the two permutations

 where      the short cycle        245   is obtained,      we turn to the           remaining
elements, and knowing that those in the                     first line are of         necessity
the same as those in the second, we see that the application of the
same process to them must, for the same reason as before, lead to                               s
cycle.       The possibility of arriving at any permutation by                       means    of
cyclical permutations alone is thus made manifest.                         The next point
to be established         is that a cyclical permutation            of r  elements can        h
accomplished          by r-  1 interchanges      of pairs of      elements.      Little   more

the final step is taken                   as     in Cauchy's Note of 8th March,                                   (in.    34)
      This rule of Cauchy's Jacobi deservedly                                         characterises        as   beautiful.
It    is important, however, to take note that it possesses the other
quality      of usefulness in as marked                                    a degree ;       and such being the

which was its due. Any reader who will mike a comparison of it
and Cramer's by actual application of them to a number of examples
will      soon find that Cramer's is more lengthy and                                           requires        more care
to    be given to      it       to avoid errors.*
      The preliminary subject of permutations having                                                 been thus dealt
 with, determinants                  are taken up.                   In    the first section regarding them
 there    is little noteworthy.                       Cauchy's word "ternie" is supplanted by
 the fitter word            element, and term                         ("terminus")               is put to a more
 appropriate        use     ;    that is to say,                               is called an element                   of the

 upon the         aggregate              of terms            by the             vanishing of certain                  of the
 elements.         The propositions enunciated, with the exception of one
 made use of at an earlier date by Scherk, are as follows (pp. 291,

As immediate deductions from the definition these                                                       are    somewhst
out of place, the trouble of demonstrating the first of them being
virtually thrown away.    The trouble taken by Jacobi, too, was less
than required, the question of sign, for example, being inadequately
discussed.
  In   the course of the next section which deals                                              with what        we have

aggregate connected                      with this law, Jacobi gives an expression for                                     the

understood from the treatment of one of the others.                                           The generjl

has now to be noticed that a goodly proportion of them must vanish
because     of the fact that               2±    ara/a("   • • .      = 0 when any two of
its inferior indices are alike.                  The right-hand side will thus not be
altered in substance             if the summatory symbol              be now taken to mean
that r,   s, t,   .  .    .  ,   w are to be any n +              1   of   the   p+    1  indices

his addition to the multiplication-theorem.                          His formal enunciation

    The two remaining           sections (15 and 16) deal with a special
system     of simultaneous linear equations,               interesting application
being made to the theory of the Method of Least Squares.
    It  is important to note, in conclusion, that from one point                   of
view Jacobi's        memoir was but the introduction             to  two others    of
really greater importance, both treating of a special class of deter
minants.        The first concerns determinants of the kind afterwards
deservedly associated with his name, and bears the title "De deter-
minantibus functirmnlibm."             It   occupies     the forty-one pages (pp.
319-359) immediately following the general memoir.                       The other,
                    "
with the title De fundionibus alternantibus earumque divisions per
productum       e differentiis elementorum conflatum," treats of those deter
minants, first considered by Cauchy, in which the members of one
set of indices represent powers,           and   to which the name        alternants
afterwards came to be assigned.               It  extends to twelve pages (pp.
360-371).         The three memoirs together constitute an excellent
treatise on the subject, and are known to have been markedly
influential in spreading a knowledge of it among mathematicians.

    The note, although on so trite           a subject   as the  division of permu

 The preference      is a    little difficult   to  justify  ; for notwithstanding
 Cauchy's assertion        that groups come naturally            into evidence, the
 idea is far-fetched as compared             with that of circular substitutions.

 Of    course, the primitive permutation                                                      is looked upon                                                as   haviug     its
groups also, viz., one for every letter in the permutation.
   Then comes the important proposition — Tlie interchange                                                                                                           of   ticv
letters     increases           or diminishes the number   of groups (substitution-
cycles) by unity.                  In proving it the two letters are first taken in
different groups,
                       (a,b,c,       .       .       .       ,       h,k),           (l,m,n,              .       .           .       ,    r,s);
and since any member                                 of a group may occupy the first place, the
letters a and              I    are fixed                            upon.               Now what the groups imply                                                           is
that the letters
                       a, b, c,              ....                         h, k, I, 7n, w,                         .           .       .    .    r,      «
in the primitive permutation                                             are changed into
                       b, c,                 .       .       .       .    k, a, m, n,                             ....«, I
respectively to form the given permutation.                                                                           If therefore in the given
permutation the letters a and                                                  I   be interchanged, the new permuta
tion so obtained will be got from the primitive by changing
                      a, b, c,           .       .       .       ,       7t,   k,   I,   m, n,            .           .           .   ,    r,   s
into
                      b,    c,                                           k,    I,   m, n,                                             ,        s,   a   ;
that   is   to say, by the changes indicated by the single group
                               (a,b,c,       .
                                             .               .       ,     h,k,l,m,n,             .       .               .   ,           r,s).
The interchange of two letters belonging                                                                                  to              different groups                  is
thus seen to reduce the number of groups by one.                                                                                                        On the other
hand,     it   is   clear       that had this single group belonged                                                                                     to the given
permutation, the interchange of two letters, a and                                                                                        I     say,         would havr
the effect of breaking up the group into two,
                    (a,b,c,      .   .       .   ,           h,k) and                    (l,m,n,              .           .           .   ,    r,o).
The theorem          is   thus established.                                                                                                                       (tn.    35)

   Similar forms, but with more robust markings, occur in the
Oamaru deposit, and have been regarded                                     by Mr E. Grove either                 as
abnormal forms of Steplianophyxis, or as probably belonging                                                      to
Liradiscus.          The former opinion, adopted by Schmidt (Atl., pi. cxxx.

      According to Ehrenberg's                          original definition, there should be 12
markings               in    *01    mm.            Fasciculi       were     hardly       indicated             in     his
figures,          several     of which approach his C. intermedins.                                  There      is       no
close affinity to              C. punctatus,               Ehrb.,       as he at one            time believed
(Mon. Ber. Ak., 1844, pp. 186, 188-191).   The species approaches
C. Normani, Greg., but in the latter the markings are loss regular,
the fasciculi at the border consist of about                                    6   rows instead of 12,
and        the lines          between              the fasciculi         are less       distinct            Janisch
erroneously describes                        the markings          as round.            Schmidt,          in    1874,
erroneously refers                   to      the    fasciculi      as    branched towards the same
side by            a    bent ray.             Specimens are sometimes                     confounded with
C. odontophorus,                   Grun., and C. Rothii, Grun., and are distinguished
from         G.    symmetricus, Grev., and C. denarius, Sch., only by their
smaller            markings,            to    which         transitional         forms       occur, Grunow
liaving           observed         forms from Monterey and Australia                             with       5J      to    7

   Grunow, in his synopsis of this genus {Denk. Wien. Ak., 1884,
p. 71), states correctly in his section 15 that the markings become
smaller          both     towards           the centre              and towards            the     border,        but
erroneously states                  in the following section (16) that only                                 the outer
most markings are smaller, and by this means he differentiates this
species.

another name                      still,        Cosmiodiscus                 imperfedus.               The     absence          of
processes, however,                        is    not of itself sufficient to exclude the                                 species

      Molecular Constitution of Matter.                                             By        Sir William
                                                   Thomson.
                                               (Read    July     1, 1889.)
      §    1.     The scientific world is practically unanimous in believing that
all       tangible       or palpable matter,                molar matter           as we may           call    it,   con
sists        of      groups    of mutually          interacting atoms or molecules.                                  This
molecular constitution of matter                                is    essentially         a     deviation            from
 homogeneousness                   of substance,             and apparent homogeneousness                                 of
 molar matter can only be homogeneousness in the aggregate.                                                           "   A
 body     called homogeneous when any two equal and similar
                is                                                                                               parts

 parts, are undistinguishable from                              one another by any difference                             in
 quality."*     now add that unless                                  "
                       I                                      the        part" of the body referred to
 consists of            an enormously great number of molecules,                                  this statement
 is essentially             the definition         of crystalline           structure.            It     is,   indeed,
 very difficult             to imagine equilibrium,                 static or kinetic, in an irregular
  random crowd of                  molecules.           Such      a      crowd might lie            a    liquid,     —I
  can scarcely           see      how   it   could be       a   solid.      It     seems, therefore,            that      a
  homogeneous isotropic solid                          is   but an isotropically macled crystal                           ;
  that     is     to say,     a   solid composed            of crystalline portions having their
  crystalline axes or lines of symmetry distributed                                                with random
  equality in all directions.  The proved highly                                                 perfect       optical
  isotropy of the glass of object-glasses                             of great refracting telescopes,
  and of good glass prisms,                        seems to demonstrate                       that the ultimate
  molecular            structure        is   fine-grained enough                 to let        there     be homo
  geneous            crystalline portions, which contain very large numbers of
  molecules while their extent throughout space                                     is   very small in com
  parison with the wave-length of light.

taken from Bravais' doctrine of homogeneous                      assemblages,       -which
we may look upon as the grammar of molecular construction.
                     Space-Periodic Paetitioning
                                                             (§§ 3-13).
    § 3.   Given a homogeneous          assemblage of points       :  let it be required
to partition all space accordingly.            The thing     to be done is concisely
defined     in the    second sentence of § 6 below.
    §4. The problem is clearly indeterminate.                     Here is a solutioo
which      has    obvious    relation    to   Brewster's     kaleidoscope        and the
corresponding doctrine of electric images, and which may be import
ant in respect to Vortex Theory for a crystal or ether.                        From P,     a
point of the given assemblage, draw              a  line,  PN, of any length in         any
direction, provided only that            N is not      a point of the assemblage of
P's.      Do the      same relatively     to every other of the P-assemblage.
We thus have            a homogeneous        assemblage     of double points, PN.
Let Q be any point in space, and let 2 denote summation for all
the PN's. Let <f>(D) be a function which decreases as D increases
from 0 to      oo .    The equation
                                2[*(QP)-<KQN)]            = 0,
expresses       a   locus for Q which partitions space periodically, and
divides each periodic portion into two cells containing respectively
an    N and     a   P.    Every cell containing an          N   is   a  parallel pervert
(footnote on § 45a below) of every cell containing a P.                         That this
is true we        see  by drawiDg any straight line to equal distances in
opposite      directions through the point midway between                      N   and P.
 Its  ends are similarly       related,   one of them to       all the N's    ; the other
 to  all the    P's.
     § 5.  Hero is a perfectly general solution.             Around any        one of the
points     P describe a closed       surface S, of which the greatest distance
 from     P is less than that        of P's nearest neighbour.              Describe      an
 equal, homochirally         similar, and same-ways          oriented surface around
 every other point P.           None     of these     surfaces   cuts or touches        any
 other.      Expand all of them simultaneously, equally, and without
 altering shape or orientation,          till one  of   them touches another.            AH
 corresponding pairs of the surfaces               touch simultaneously at           corre
 sponding points.          Continue     the expansion, annulling            in   each  case
 the mutually enclosed portions of the expanding surfaces,                        and sob

 stituting the portion of fixed surface            traced, or left behind, by the
expanding line of mutual intersection.                 This portion of    surface we
shall call (after my brother, Professor James Thomson) an interface.
Follow the same rule when another, another, and another contact
takes     place.     When the borders of two of the growing interfaces
thus traced meet and begin to intersect,               annul their projecting por
tions, so that the intersection and what is left of the expansion of
its previous border now constitute the boundary of the interface.
Continue the process until fresh growing intersections of interfaces
are formed, and the ends of these growing intersections meet, and at
last nothing is left of the expanded original surfaces, and therefore
nothing       of   space is left unenclosed by the           cells— polyhedrons of
 interfaces — thus       constructed.
     § 6. The interfaces       formed in §    5 are generally curved, but,      as we
 shall   see (§ 7), may be plane, and are so         in particular   cases of special
interest.        In every   case each cell contains one, and only one, of the
 P's  ;  there is no interstitial space between them            ; they are all equal,
 homochirally similar, and con-orientational.
     § 7.  If  the initiating surface,      S, of § 5 is a polyhedron of plane
facets, the periodic partition          to which it leads is in polyhedrons of
 plane facets.         So it is  also if the initiating     surface is any ellipsoid
 with    P   for centre.
     § 8.  Let S     be a sphere.      The partitional polyhedron, to which         it
 leads, is the dodekahedron obtained by drawing planes through the
 middle points of the lines between            P and   its twelve next-neighbours,
 perpendicular to these lines.
     § 9.   If  S is an ellipsoid similar to and con-orientational with that
 determined in § 47 below, the partitional polyhedron to which it
 leads is the rhomboidal dodekahedron to which the rhombic dodeka
 hedron of § 21 below is converted by the homogeneous strain of
 § 46.      In this case the whole number of contacts of the expanding
 surfaces     (§  5) is twelve, and they all take place simultaneously.
     § 10.    If  the assemblage becomes equilateral, the partitional dode-
 kahedrons of §§ 8,         9   become,    each of them,      the rhombic dodeka
 hedron of § 21.
     § 11.    If  S is an ellipsoid, having conjugate diameters along lines
  from    P  to other three     points of the assemblage, and of magnitudes
 proportional to the distances from             P to the     nearest  points in these

 lines, the partitional          polyhedron       to which     it   leads     is a parallele
 piped.
      § 12.   If    the three pointe chosen           are    nearest    neighbours of P
 (§ 45i below), we are led to the best conditioned (or least oblique) of
 all the infinity of parallelepipeds! partitions possible.                         This     ia the
 most obvious and the best known of the periodic partitions                            of   space.
   §13. Taking the parallelepiped al partitioning of §11, let                                F be
 the farthest corner from P, so that PF is the longest diagonal                             of the
 parallelepiped.         Let PA, PB, PC           be conterminous           edges and        AF,
B'F, C'F their opposites conterminous in F. Draw the planes
ABC, A'B'C. We thus divide the parallelepiped into three parts —
an octohedron ABCA'B'C; and two tetrahedrons, PABC, FA'B'C,
which are parallel              mutual
                            perverts (footnote on § 45a below).
This grouping of eight points of a homogeneous assemblage    as                              is,
we shall see later, important            in   the dynamics of molecular structure,
or at all events in Boscovich's theory.*
                On Boscovich's        Theory      (§§ 14-44 and        §§   62-71).
   §14. Without accepting Boscovich's fundamental doctrine that
the ultimate atoms of matter are points endowed each with inertia
and      with      mutual attractions         or repulsions dependent on mutual
distances, and that all the properties of matter are due to equilibrium
of these forces, and to motions, or changes                   of motion, produced                  by
them when they are not balanced; we can learn something towards
an understanding of the real molecular structure                       of    matter,    and        of
some of its thermodynamic properties, by consideration of the static
and kinetic problems which               it   suggests.     Hooke's exhibition              of   the
forms of crystals by piles of globes, Navier's and Poisson's theory                                of
the elasticity of solids, Maxwell's and Clausius' work                        in   the kinetic
theory of gases, and Tait's more recent work on the same subject —
all developments of Boscovich's                  theory pure and simple —amply
justify this       statement.

by    a curve,         — the    celebrated           Boscovich curve,       — to explain     cohesion,
mutual pressure between bodies in contact, chemical affinity, and all
possible properties of matter — except heat, which he regarded                                       as a
sulphureous essence or virtue.                            It   seems now wonderful          that, after
so clearly stating his fundamental postulate which included inertia,
he did not             see   inter-molecular            motion as a necessary consequence of
it,   and so discover the kinetic theory of heat for solids, liquids, and
gases    ;     and that he only used his inertia of the atoms to explain the
known phenomena                      of the inertia of palpable masses, or assemblages
of very large numbers of atoms.
     §   16.      It   is    also    wonderful          how much        towards explaining            the
crystallography and elasticity of solids, and the thermo-elastic pro
perties of solids, liquids, and gases, we find without assuming more
than one transition from attraction to repulsion.                                 Suppose,      for in
stance, the mutual force                       between two atoms to be zero for all dis
tances exceeding               a    certain distance,      I,   which we shall call the radius of
the sphere of influence                   ;   to be repulsive when the distance between
them         is   <£;        zero when        it   is   =£; and attractive when            it   is   >£ :
and consider the equilibrium                            of groups of atoms under these con
ditions.
     A group of two would                     be     in equilibrium     at distance    £;    and only

preliminary remarks here may be useful.

    § 18. Every infinite homogeneous              assemblage
is  in equilibrium.        So, therefore,      is every finite homogeneous         assem
 blage, provided       that extraneous         forces   be applied to     all within in
fluential    distance of the           frontier,   equal    to  the   forces   which      a
homogeneous         continuation of the assemblage through influential dis
 tance beyond the frontier, would exert on them.                    The investigation
 of these extraneous         forces     for any given homogeneous            assemblage
of single atoms — or of groups of                atoms    as explained     below— con
 stitutes the Boscovich equilibrium-theory               of elastic solids.
     §19. To investigate        the equilibrium       of a homogeneous       assemblage
 of two or more         atoms, imagine,         in  a  homogeneous       assemblage      of
 groups of    i  atoms,   all the atoms except one held fixed.                 This    one
 experiences      zero resultant force from all the points corresponding to
 itself in the whole assemblage, since it and they constitute                    a  homo
 geneous assemblage         of single points.        Hence it must experience         zero
 resultant force also from all the other t                — 1
                                                               assemblages     of single
 points.    This condition, fulfilled           for each one of the atoms of the
 compound molecule,            clearly suffices       for the     equilibrium      of the
 assemblage, whether the constituent atoms of the compound molecule
 are similar or dissimilar.
    § 20.  When all the atoms are similar — that is to say, when the mutual
 force is the same for the same distance between every pair — it might
 be supposed       that a homogeneous            assemblage,    to be in equilibrium,
  must be of single points          ;   but this is not true,      as we see    syntheti
 cally, without reference to the question of stability, by the following
     * " Homogeneous assemblage of points, or of groups of points, or of bodies, or
 of systems of bodies," is an expression which needs no definition, because it
 speaks for itself unambiguously. The geometrical subject of homogeneous assem
 blages is treated with perfect simplicity and generality by Bravais, in the
 Journal dc Vl&cole Polytechnique, cahier xxxiii. pp. 1-128 (Paris, 1S50).

points, with the condition of equilibrium for each when the mutual
forces act.
    §21. Preliminary. — Consider               an equilateral*        homogeneous     assem
blage of single points, 0, 0', &c.                 Bisect every line between nearest
neighbours       by    a    plane perpendicular           to    it.  These planes     divide
space     into rhombic          dodekahedrons.           Let AjOA5,       A2OA6> A3OAT,
A4OAg, be the diagonals through the eight trihedral                           angles of the
dodekahedron inclosing 0, and let 2a                     be   the length of each.      Place
atoms Qj,       Q5,            Q0, Q3,    QT, Q4,      Qs, on these lines, at equal dis
tances,    r, from     0  ;   and do likewise          for every     other point, O', O",
&c, of       the    infinite      homogeneous          assemblage.        We thus      have,
around each point A, four atoms, Q, Q', Q", Q'", contributed by the
four dodekahedrons of which trihedral angles are contiguous in A,
and fill the space around A.                  The distance of each of these atoms
 from   A   is a - r.
    § 22.   Suppose,       now, r to be very small.              Mutual repulsions of the
atoms of the groups of eight around the points O                        will preponderate.
But    suppose a      -r     to be very small       ;  mutual repulsions of the atoms
 of the groups of four around the points                   A will   preponderate.     Hence
 for some value of           r  between     zero and a, there        will be  equilibrium
There may, according to the law of force, be more than one value of
r between      zero and a giving equilibrium                ;   but whatever be the law
 of force, there is one value of             r giving     stable equilibrium,     supposing
the atoms to be constrained to the lines                     OA, and the     distances   r to
be constrainedly equal.              It  is clear     from the symmetries around           0
and around A, that neither of these constraints is necessary for mere
equilibrium; but without them                   the    equilibrium     might   be unstable.
Thus     we    have found          a    homogeneous          equilateral   distribution    of
8-atom     groups in equilibrium.               Similarly, by placing        atoms on the
three diagonals, B,OB4,             B.^OBj,    B;lOI>0,     through the six tetrahedral
angles of the dodekahedron around O, we find a homogeneous                             equi
lateral distribution          of G-atom groups in equilibrium.
    § 23.   Place,    now, an atom at each point O.                  The equilibrium will
be disturbed       in each        case,   but there       will    be equilibrium    with    a

     This   means such an assemblage as that of the centres of equal globes piled
homogeneously,       as in the ordinary triangular-based, or square-based, or oblong-
rectangle-based,    pyramids of rouud shot, or of billiard-balls.

different value of      r (still  between zero and a).      Thus    we have 9-atom
groups and 7-atom groups.
    § 24. Thus, in all, we have found homogeneous                   distributions of
6-atom, of 7-atom, of 8-atom, and of 9-atom groups, each in             equilibrium.
Without stopping          to look    for more    complex groups,       or for 5-atom
or 4-atom groups,         we find a homogeneous          distribution    of 3-atom*
groups    in equilibrium by placing         an atom     at every point O,      and at
each of the eight points Aw A5,            Aj,  A6, A3, AT, A4, Ag.        There are
four obvious ways of seeing this, found by choosing one or other
of the four diagonals through trihedral              angles   referred to    in § 21.
Take, for example,          AjOA5, and its       congeners    for all the dodeka-
hedrons.       These triplets include all the A's.         (Compare § 25 below.)
    § 25. Lastly,      choosing A„, A3,       A4, so that the        angles  AjOA.,,
AjOAj, AjOA4,          are each obtuse,     t we make a homogeneous            assem
blage of 2-atomJ groups            in equilibrium    by placing atoms at O,        Alf
A2,    A3, A4.       There are four obvious ways (compare § 24 above) of
seeing    this  as  an  assemblage of di-atomic groups, one of which is as
follows      — Choose                                              Aj, As,
           :             A1 and O as one pair.        Through               A4, draw-
lines same-wards         parallel to   AjO, and     each equal to       Afi.    Their
ends lie at the centres          of neighbouring dodekahedrons, which pair
with          A3, A4 respectively.
    § 26.    For  the   Boscovich theory of the elasticity of solids, the
consideration of this homogeneous               assemblage     of double atoms is
very important.          Remark that every        0 is  at the centre of an equi
lateral tetrahedron of four A's          ; and every     A  is at the centre of an
equal    and similar, but contrary-ways oriented, tetrahedron of O's.
The corners       of each of these tetrahedrons are respectively              A, and
three of its twelve nearest           A-neighbours    ; and    0 and three of its
twelve       nearest   O-neighbours.       By aid of      an    illustrative   model
showing four of the one set of tetrahedrons               with their corner atoms
painted blue, and one tetrahedron of atoms in their centres painted
red, the mathematical theory which had been communicated to the
Royal Society of Edinburgh,              was illustrated to Section         A of   the
British Association        at its recent meeting in Newcastle.

obtuse angles is equal to 180° -cos~'(l/3).

    § 27.   In this theory* it is shown that in      an elastic solid constituted
by    a single homogeneous      assemblage      of Boscovich atoms, there are
in   general    two different rigidities,    n, nv and one bulk-modulus,          Jc ;
between which there is essentially the relation
                                  3£=3n+2n1,
whatever be the law of force.           Here «j denotes what are called the
diagonal rigidities, and n the facial rigidities          relative to the primi
tive cube of § 53 below.        By facial and diagonal rigidities relative to
any given cube       I mean   rigidities defined in the usual manner,! one
of them according       to shearing parallel to any face        of the  cube, the
other according to shearing in planes parallel to any plane-diagonal
 of the   cube.
    § 28.  A remarkable result of my mathematical investigation is,
that the facial rigidity, relatively         to the primitive      cube   of   § 52,
is double the diagonal rigidity in the            case in which each atom ex
periences     force only from its twelve nearest neighbours.           The law of
force may        be so adjusted as to make Hj =         «;  and in this case we
have 3k = 5n, which        is Poisson's relation.       But   no such relation is
obligatory when the elastic solid consists of a homogeneous                 assem
blage of double, or triple, or multiple            Boscovich atoms.         On the
contrary, any arbitrarily       chosen    values may be given to the bulk-
modulus and to the rigidity,           by proper adjustment of the law of
force, even though we take nothing             more complex than the homo
geneous assemblage of double Boscovich atoms above described.

directions.       As    we    are  supposing the masses of all            the     atoms
equal, we may call the mass of each                  unity: thus    2|i-   for all the
atoms in any part of space at any time, is the total of their                   kinetic

as   worked out by Maxwell and Tait              ;

would give the same result depends,                   for each collision,    very com
plexly     on   the   law of force,      and on the velocities and lines               of
motion of the atoms before            the collision.        As long   as there is no
case of collision       between    more than two atoms, the average energy
of the free atoms at any time, and the law of the distribution                         of
energy among        the multitude      in their     free paths   between collisions,
is not affected by this complication, and is the same as                 if the atoms
were     equal    hard    globes   merely repellent at contact.             It is   only
 when the results of unequal distributions of density, of energy, or of
components        of momentum,       are to be traced,         and the laws of the
 relation of pressure         to  density, or of thermal conduction, or of
 viscosity are to be investigated, that we can take into account the
 law of force, and can find differences              from what the results would
 be   if we had merely the hard equal balls to deal with.
     § 33.  But now suppose, while two atoms are in collision,                 a   third
 to come     within their influential        distance,    so that three shall be in
 collision at the same time.          All   three may go clear, or two of them
 may remain in collision, or in other words, fall into combination,
 and one go free.         It is scarcely possible that all three can remain           in

collisions, and the still rarer triplets,           will   be liable to be separated
again into single atoms by all fresh collisions.                This is the   case of a
perfect monatomic gas, at a temperature much higher than the
Andrews' critical point.
    § 35.   But    if  the originally-given       velocity be exceedingly small,
the result of exceedingly nearly every triple collision will be to form
a combination of at least two            of  the three colliding     atoms.      Imme
diately after the collision by which it was formed, each doublet will
generally have considerable relative motion of its two atoms                      ; that
is to say, the two        will  describe   orbits round their common centre of
inertia   :  or,  in the   extreme case of no moment           of momentum round
this point, they will oscillate relatively to their centre of inertia to
and fro in a straight line ; the centre of inertia itself generally
having      a  considerable velocity.          Still supposing the       average velo
cities of the free atoms           to be very small, and their number to be
very great in comparison with that of the double-atoms,                   we now see
that the general effect of the collisions between double and single
atoms must be to diminish             the energies of the relative and absolute
motions       of the constituents         of the doublets, and so reduce             the
doublets more and more nearly to the condition of pairs of atoms in
relative      equilibrium      (§  16   above),     at  distance   £   asunder,     with
centre of inertia of each pair moving very slowly through space.
   § 36.    But now consider the             effect   of  a collision   between two
doublets each with little or no intestine commotion before the
collision, and with its centre of inertia moving very slowly through
space.      The    case  in which the same description would be applicable
to the four atoms after the collision, whether in the same pairs or
in interchanged pairs, would              be exceedingly rare.         So also would
be the case of the four atoms              remaining combined.           The result in
exceedingly nearly every case would be a triplet with considerable
intestine      commotion,        and its centre        of inertia    moving     rapidly

tli rough space, and a single atom moving rapidly                        through   space.
The general tendency of subsequent                collisions between these rapidly-
moving triplets and single atoms, with the multitude of slowly-moving
single atoms throughout space, would be to diminish the energy of
the intestine commotions of the triplets, and of the motions                       of  the
centres     of inertia, both of the triplets and of                  the   single  atoms,
reducing each triplet to very nearly the condition                       of equilibrium
(§16     above) at the corners of an equilateral triangle of side £                  with
a   slow translatory motion through space.
     § 37.    By similar        dynamical       considerations        we   see  that the
general tendency of collisions             between     doublets and triplets, or be
 tween triplets        and triplets, must be to form quartets,             quintets, and
 sextets     of    atoms ;    and that when          such groups, carrying          away
 large   kinetic      energies  from the generative          collisions, subsequently
 collide with slowly-moving            single atoms, the general tendency must
 be to diminish         their kinetic energies,        and reduce them more and
 more     nearly to groups in one or other configuration of equilibrium,
 with slow motion of their           centres of inertia through space.
     § 38.   But now consider           a   collision    between       a  slowly-moving
 triplet or quartet or more-multiple group, and a slowly-moving single
 atom.      Even with the triplet the case will not be rare in which the
 single atom will remain in combination, and the result yielded be                        a
 quartet having considerable intestine commotion, and moving slowly
  through space.          In collisions between        a  quartet and a single atom,
 the case will be relatively less rare, and with a quintet and single
  atom,   still   less rare for a single atom to remain           in combination, and
 form    a quintet or a sextet.
     § 39.   If    groups    of large numbers of atoms              in equilibrium,      or
  slowly vibrating, have been thu6 formed, or are given ready formed,
  with single atoms slowly moving in the space all around them, each
  single atom        colliding   with   a  group will very frequently remain in
  the group     ;  and in virtue of the exhaustion of potential energy thus
  effected    the    vibrational    energy   of the group will be slightly aug
  mented.         But in not       rare   cases    either   the single atom which
  collided, or one of the atoms of the group in the neighbourhood of
  the   collision, will be driven off, and generally with much greater'
  velocity than the colliding atom had before the collision.                     Thus the

kept      constant, while the group is gaining hy the accession                                    to   it of
more and           more single           atoms from without.               But the exhaustion of
potential energy                due to the greater           number falling into, than being
thrown out from, the group would cause                                      an     augmentation           of
kinetic energy in the surrounding atmosphere                                    of free atoms.            To
obviate this, let               the atmosphere            around the group be contained in a
finite    closed vessel, which, when left to itself, repels each atom that
comes near enough to                     it,   and sends    it    back inwards with unchanged
energy.            Now let portions of this bounding                            surface     be movable,
and let       them be so moved                   by proper external appliances,                 that work
shall     be done             upon them by the impinging                    atoms      to   just   such    a
degree        as    to        keep   the average kinetic            energy       of the free atoms
constant.           We         have thus        a   Boscovichian realisation of             a   crystal of
ice (hoar-frost) or other substance growing by condensation of                                             a
surrounding atmosphere of the same substance.    The process in
nature requires the abstraction of what                            is   called the latent heat of
the vapour               to    allow     it    to condense.         This in our Boscovichian
 system       is    performed by the arrangement                        for letting work be done
 outwards by the moving parts of the boundary.
   §    40.   Even        if     there     were     no surrounding          atmosphere          of single
 moving atoms,                  our group, unless            quite free         from intestine com
 motion,       would occasionally throw                       off an atom          in virtue of          the
 chance       concurrence of different                     sets   of component vibrations                 at
 some of the              outlying        atoms.          Now let       there    be   just enough of
 atoms moving about in the spaco around the group to cause as
 many fallings-in as throwings-out of atoms, and with just enough of
 kinetic energy to neither gain nor lose energy in the surrounding
 atmosphere through these changes.                           This will      also cause the average
 kinetic energy of the group to remain constant.                                      Thus we have         a
 crystal surrounded by an atmosphere  of vapour                                       at its own tem
 perature,         and at the proper temperature to cause neither condensa
 tion of the vapour nor evaporation of the solid.
   §    41.    Now by somehow                   applying force to the atoms of the group
 increase their vibrational                     energy.      We must, by introducing                atoms
 from the boundary, increase                        the density of the atmosphere                  around
 it    to cause as many atoms to enter the group as are thrown off from
 it.     Continue this process until the inter atomic oscillations in the
 group become                 so great    that the atoms begin to pass from one con

 two configurations of         § 46    (footnote) below.        The group may still
 retain its form as      a   solid, and something of its rigidity as a solid.
     § 42.   Now   reverse the operations at the boundary so as to diminish
 the inter-atomic oscillatory            energy    of the group.       The atoms may
 fall back into their previous positions of equilibrium.                     But they
 may     not;   and instead they may fall into                another    configuration
 more readily taken         in  a  settlement from internal agitation than the
 previous configuration which was arrived at by growth from the bound
ary.    This (with    true molecules of matter instead of the ideal         Boscovich
atoms)     seems to me, without             doubt, the explanation of Madan's*
beautiful discovery regarding chlorate of potash, and the change of
crystalline structure, by which Lord Rayleighf has shown that the
 optical phenomena         presented      in it   are to be explained.       Virtually
 the same view to explain             other changes       of crystalline structure by
differences     of temperature         or applications of pressure seems to have
been given by       M. Mallard,        % who is quoted by Madan in the article
above referred to.          In   a  future communication to the Royal Society
I   hope to include considerations regarding the effect of inter-atomic
forces and motions         in guiding      to one or other of the two configura
tions described      in § 54 and footnote on § 46 below.
     § 43. Once more communicate and continue communicating energy
to the group by forces applied directly to its constituent atoms, and,
at the     same time, keep introducing                fresh  atoms    from  the outer
boundary into the atmosphere               surrounding the group to prevent the
number of atoms in the group from diminishing.                    The intestine com
motion will become so great that all configurations of equilibrium
are utterly departed from, but             still the atom is surrounded by neigh

clear that our original group which was a crystal and is now fluid
will remain        more     dense   than the surrounding         atmosphere    of free
atoms until we have imparted to the group far more of energy than
was required to dislodge its constituent atoms from configurations of
equilibrium.          There then is a mass           of liquid surrounded by an
atmosphere         of its vapour, and in thermal equilibrium                 with the
vapour      if we cease the action on its atoms              by which we imparted
energy to it.         A little   farther consideration would no doubt give us
the virtual surface-tension of the liquid exactly according to Laplace's
theory of capillary attraction           ;  but we must not pause over this at
present.

    (d) A homogeneous assemblage of points means, and cannot mean
 other than, an assemblage which presents the same aspect and the

successively       equal   to the distance between        the two chosen       points,
 are points of the assemblage.            The interval between each point and
 the next to it on either side in the line is called by Bravais                     the
parameter of the row.

Along      the    line of each side of the triangle             produced    in both
directions, mark off in succession              lengths equal to the side,         and

similar, being parallel perverts,    either of the other, or parallel mutual perverts.
From every point P of a body or group of points, draw a line through any

is a parallel pervert of the group (P). The groups (P) and (P') are parallel
mutual perverts.        Turn (P') 180° round any line OK. In the position thus
reached, it is the image of (P) in a plane mirror through 0, perpendicular to
OK.    In their present positions they are mutual perverts inverted relatively
to the line OK.       Mutual perverts are allochirally similar.

Fig.    1   shows a homogeneous         distribution of points in a plaue.  In
the diagram they are joined by lines, determinately chosen accord
ing    to § (i), so that all the angles         of triangles formed by        them are
acute.       Closely   related   to this triangular      arrangement are three
others.       One of these is obtained by omitting PQ and its parallels

and taking       instead the other diagonal OD of the parallelogram
QOPD and drawing parallels              to   it through all the points.       The   frwo
others are obtained similarly by omitting OQ and taking instead
the other diagonal PE of the parallelogram QPOE; and by omitting
OP and taking instead the other diagonal QF of the parallelogram
PQOF.

angles equal, similar, and similarly oriented to the triangles of                   (/).
The distance      between each of these planes, and the next plane to                 it,
is   easily proved to be equal to the reciprocal of the product of twice
the area of the triangle into the number of points per unit volume.

— Instead         of choosing our first two points and our first triangle at
random, take any point            0    and its nearest neighbour on either side,
P;   and its next-nearest neighbour                    Q   on the side making the angle
QOP       acute.      The two other angles of this triangle are obviously, as
Bravais remarks, acute.                The only other way of thus finding                         best
conditioned triangles         is   by taking           O's other nearest        neighbour, P',
and its other next-nearest, Q'. The triangles Q'OP and QOP are
equal, homochirally similar, and oppositely oriented and thus we            ;
find the only other possible best conditioned                          triangular grouping.
Every other triangle of the points in the same plane, having none
of the points within its area, has, as Bravais remarks, an obtuse
angle.       Consider now the nearest                  parallel plane of points on one
side of the plane of         QOP.           Let   R   and its congeners     black dots)

points      of the nearest         parallel plane on the other                   si.de    of QOP.

    R being, of the projections on the plane of                    POQ of all            the points
of the two parallel planes, the one which lies within the area of the
triangle QOP, we have in                OPQR          a    best conditioned       tetrahedronal
grouping.          OP'Q'R'   is   another and the only other best conditioned
tetrahedronal grouping.                It   is   a   parallel pervert of    OPQR          [see   foot
note on           45a above].     Hence  homogeneous

        Closest  Packing of one Homogeneous* Assemblage nf Equal
                       and Similar Globes or Ellipsoids.
    § 46. Take our tetrahedron          OPQR, and by        homogeneous      distor-
tional strain convert it into an equilateral tetrahedron                ABCD,     of
equal volume.        Take four globes, of diameters         equal to the edges of
this tetrahedron and place them with their centres                   at  its  corner
points A, B, C, D.        Alter this  assemblage     of globes by homogeneous
strain till their centres,   ABCD,     become again the corner points         of the
original tetrahedron, OPQR.             The globes have now become ellip
soids.     Dealing thus with the whole original homogeneous assemblage
of points, we find        a  closest  packed homogeneous          distribution    of
equal and similar ellipsoids through space.
    § 47.   To find every possible closest       packed homogeneous          assem
blage of given equal and similar ellipsoids, take a tetrahedron of four
equal globes.       Choose    any three mutually perpendicular directions,
and, by elongations and          shrinkages of the group parallel to these
directions, convert each globe into an ellipsoid            equal and similar to
   *
      There is another closest packing of globes or ellipsoids which has the same
density   as, and might without careful attention be mistaken for, the closest
homogeneous packing.       For simplicity think only of globes, and take a plant
covered with globes touching one another in equilateral triangular order.
Look at the accompanying diagram, fig. 6 of § (55) below, and see that there are
two ways of placing a second layer on the first to continue the formation of an
assemblage.     The globes of the second layer may be placed, all of them ove:
the black dots ( ¦ ) or all of them over the white dots ( ° ).      But haviug once
chosen the position of the second layer there is no more freedom to choose in
adding on layer after layer if we are to make a single homogeneous assemblage.
Of the two positions which might be chosen for the third layer we must choose
the one in which the globes are not over the globes of the first layer.          The
position of the fourth layer must be the one of which the globes are not over
the globes of the second layer, but are over those of the first layer, and so on.
   If on the contrary we place the globes of the third layer over the globes of
the first, the globes of the fourth layer over those of the second, and so on, we
have a peculiar and symmetrical grouping which was first, so far as I know ,
described by Air William Barlow (Nature, December 20 and 27, 18S3).             This
grouping is not one homogeneous assemblage.        It consists of two homogeneous
assemblages, one of them constituted by the first, third, fifth, seventh, 4c,
layers; the other the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, &c, layers.     The considera
tion of this ]>eculiar mode of grouping may be of great interest in the dynamical
investigations to form the subject of my next communication to the E.S. E.
(July 15), and. as Barlow has pointed out, may be of great importance in the
theory of natural crystalline structure. I must, however, leave it for the
present.

   § 48.         In   §§ 46, 47 we have a solution of the problem given                                four
points, O, P, Q, R, not in one plane, to place con-orientatioiiaUy four
equal and similar ellipsoids with their centres at the four points, and

others.          From it we have the following perfectly simple construction
for the      answer.         Bisect OP, OQ, OR, in F, G, H, and QR,                            RP, PQ,
in F', G', H', and join FF', GG', I1H'.                        These three lines meet in one
point       S.        The planes     GSH, HSF, FSG                   are parallel to conjugate
diametral planes of the required ellipsoids.                            These ellipsoids touch
one another in the points F, F', G, G',                        H, H'.        To construct them,

distortion), in        §    46.   The assemblage of ellipsoids has all characteristic
features the same, except the inequalities of lines and angles involved
in the distortional transition from                  one configuration to the other.

 the spherical surface into eight equilateral triangles, and six squares                ;

also    in   each of the three slant sides.
     § 57.      The ordinary square              pyramid of globes has for its base the
 same      square        order structure          as    the    slant sides of the triangular
 pyramid of           § 55,     while its four slant sides have the same equilateral
 triangular         structure       as each    of the three slant sides and the base of
the pyramid of                 § 56.     If   we divide        the ordinary      square   pyramid
 into four parts by two diagonal vertical planes                             through its centre,
and turn one of these parts over till it rests on its triangular slant
side,    it   becomes the triangular pyramid of                     $ 55.

 ficial    twinning           of Iceland       spar,     by means      of   a   knife, published
about 22 years ago, soon                       after Reusch's fundamental                discovery
(1867) of the artificial twinning of Iceland spar by pressure, I
endeavoured to picture to myself the molecular tactics called into
play in the wonderful                    change     of shape        thus produced.         It   was
necessary first to suppose                  known        the molecular arrangement           in the
natural         crystal.         Two distinct        hypotheses         presented      themselves,
each     perfectly definite            ; and it seems certain that the structure is
one or other of these two.
    Hypothesis            (1).
                                 — Imagine       an equilateral        tetrahedron of       a close
packed homogeneous                  assemblage of globes.             To avoid circumlocution
let one of its faces rest on               a  horizontal plane.           Let the whole system
be shrunk            homogeneously           in lines perpendicular            to this plane     till
the originally             acute     trihedral angle of the triangular                pyramid of
globes becomes the obtuse                     trihedral angle of the rhomb of Iceland
spar.       The shrinkage ratio required to do this would be exactly
       to   1   if   the inclination        of each slant face to the base were exactly

is   Hypothesis (1).
     This Hypothesis          I      now find was given 200 years ago by Huyghens
in his Traite          de    la Lumiere (Leyden,               1690), and independently                    by
Wollaston         in the Bakerian Lecture for                     1812, Philosophical                Traxt-
actions Royal Society for the year 1813, Part                                1,   but with priority
attributed       to Huyghens.            I     had thought of           it   independently,               but
did not feel altogether satisfied with                      it,   in the first     place because
                                                                                                           of
the great internal commotion which                        it   would imply in the tactics                  of
Baumhauer's twinning.                    Then    it      occurred to me to think                     of   the
subject thus.           It    seems as    if   the aeolotropic        quality of Iceland               spar,
according to which] there are differences of quality for directional
actions along and perpendicular to the shortest line-diagonal    the                                 of
rhomb, may be naturally supposed                         to depend on the rhomb not being
a   cube   ;   and that the change from               a   cube to the Iceland spar                   rhomb
should be looked to as the cause of the seolotropy.                                 If   this    is   so ire
must begin with                 cube which      is   isotropic in respect to its four                  line-
diagonals.            This   is a   the case   with the     cube described in            §   53, bat       it
is   not the case with the cube which we find                         if   in     the shrinkage       t    of
Hypothesis (1) we pause at the stage in which                                the acute trihedral
angle of the equilateral tetrahedron                      is   rectangular on its way                 to bt-

an oblate with equatorial diameter twice as long as the polar axis.
Hence I have been led to think it probable that the molecular struc
ture of Iceland         spar  is not that of Hypothesis (1), but is as follows.
    § 59.   Hypothesis (2). — Take a primitive cube § 53 of the assemblage
and distort it by shrinkage along any one of its four line-diagonals,
 with (for simplicity) no change of length in directions perpen
dicular      to it.     This    reduces  each globe to an oblate          ellipsoid of
 revolution, and the cube to a rhomb, which is the rhomb of Iceland
 spar    if the shrinkage-ratio is J2 to 1.
     §  60. Let FG (fig. 7) be one edge and G                  one of the two obtuse
 trihedral angles of        a  rhomb of Iceland spar         ;  and F', G' the corners

 opposite to F, G (so that G'G is the optic axis). Let HKK'H' be a
 diagonal plane parallel to FG and FG'; HK, H'K' being parallel to
 FG, F'G'.        Now consider rows of          oblates parallel to    KK'   and  HH'.
 The     oblates    are  in contact    at the ends        of equatorial diameters      in
 the lines of these rows.             Turn the       oblates   of each row round the
line of the row, in the half of the assemblage above                HKK'H'    (suppos
 ing this plane horizontal and G to the right) all through equal angles
against the motion of the hands of              a  watch till their equators become
horizontal.       The assemblage of centres shears to the right (with rota
tion in the direction of the hands of a watch), FG moving rightwards,
till   the angle     between      FG   and   the end face through        F  becomes a
right angle.         Simultaneously with this shearing motion there                 is a
shrinkage of the assemblage in the direction perpendicular to                        the
plane      HKK'H',        entailed by the fact of the equatorial planes of the
oblates turning from their primary inclined positions, with equatorial
planes perpendicular to the optic axis, to their present horizontal posi
tions.      This is most readily seen by confining attention to the single
row of oblates        which initially had their centres and points of mutual
contact in the short diagonal GF' of the right-hand end face.                      The

shrinkage of the assemblage                       perpendicular               to the plane           HKK'H'
implies          elongation    in lines parallel to FG,                            because      the    volume
remains          constant, and there                  is     clearly         neither         elongation        nor
shrinkage perpendicular                  to the plane of                    the diagram.         Now        to   fit
the tactics of Baumhauer's twinning                               by the knife, we must                      have
no change of dimensions                  of the assemblage                    in the plane HKK'H'.
Hence while              the turning          and shearing motions                          described       above
are taking            place, there    must be           a    continual elongation of the                      sub
stance        of each oblate perpendicular                        to    this plane, and shrinkage
parallel to FG,* to just such an extent as to prevent the centre                                                     of
each oblate from coming nearer to the plane                                HKK'H', but instead
to       cause    all the centres            to   move           in lines parallel to FG. The
oblates are now no longer figures                            of revolution but                are ellipsoids
with three unequal axes              :   the shortest, vertical                ;    the longest, perpen
dicular to the plane of the diagram                          ;    and the mean axis parallel                     to
FG.          To complete the process, proceed                          as   follows —   :
     §61. Turn         the oblates farther on in the same direction (opposite                                    to

turned in         §   60), and through            the       same angle;            and while, in         conse
quence, the assemblage                of centres             shears         to the right,        give to the
substance         of each oblate         a   gradual shrinkage perpendicular                             to the
plane        HKK'H'        and elongation                  parallel         to the line        FG,    so as to
cause the rightward               shearing motion of the assemblage                               of    centres
to be        still exactly parallel          to the         initial position of the                  line FG.
The whole movement                   of which the first half has been described                                  in

in Baumhauer's artificial twinning of an end portion of                                          a     prism     of
Iceland spar, by           a   knife applied at                  F,    with its     edge perpendicular
to the plane of the diagram, and pressed against                                    the edge      FG     of    the
obtuse angle            between      the two upper faces of the prism before                                  and
behind the plane of the diagram.

      Perhaps the simplest way of looking at the affair         found by considering

that the elliptic section of each ellipsoid in the plane HKK'H' must remain con
stant and so also must the horizontal and vertical axes of the elliptic section

section turn in the manner described in        60, 61, the ellipse itself must remain

On the Equilibrium of a Homogeneous Assemblage of mutually
                       Attracting Points          (§§ 62-71).
   § 62. The chief object of this communication is to find the simplest
possible way of realising, by means of an assemblage of points act
ing upon     one   another with forces in the lines joining them, and
depending merely on the lengths of              the joining lines, an elastic
solid which shall     not be subject to Poisson's restriction of the            bulk-
modulus to be exactly -J of the rigidity-modulus ; but which may
on the contrary have, with given rigidity, any magnitude of bulk-
modulus through the whole range from              -£   of the rigidity to       + oc,
shown to be imaginable by Green.             That the thing       can be done        I
showed in my Baltimore Lectures (1834), and                I gave  an easily con
ceived although     a  somewhat complex way of doing it.               I  now find
that the next-to-the-simplest-possible         mode    of arranging an assem
blage of points to produce an elastic solid realises               Green's ideal;
while    the    very    simplest     possible    is   restricted    by    Poisson's
limitation.
   § 63. The simplest possible arrangement of points to make a homo
geneous elastic solid, is a single homogeneous            assemblage     as  defined
in  § 45 a-d   above.      In the first place, for simplicity we shall suppose
it to be elastically isotropic, or as nearly isotropic as we can make it.
   § 64. To make     the solid as nearly as may be isotropic, the unstrained
equilibrium    distribution     must be the equilateral homogeneous            assem
blage of §  21 above.       Consider now a finite assemblage         containing a
very great number of points thus distributed.                 To take the very
simplest possible     case,   let there  be no force exerted between           others
than nearest neighbours.          For  the case of equilibrium,      no force acts
from without on any of the points, whether on the boundary or in
the interior;    and therefore clearly there is no mutual action between
any of the points according to our present supposition                    of forces
between nearest neighbours ouly.            Suppose now the assemblage to
be in equilibrium       under the influence of forces acting on points in
the boundary, giving rise to infinitesimal           deviations from the equi
lateral  homogeneous         grouping.     Instead     of zero    force     in   each
shortest distance,     there    will now  be a force which, for stability of
equilibrium,    must be pull or thrust, according as the distance is
greater or less     than     that which we had in the zero-equilibrium.

 Thus        if,   to help ideas, we look                  to   a    Boscovich curve, the distance
 between           nearest      neighbours for zero-equilibrium,                          which for brevity
 we shall call           f,   must be         a    point in which the curve cuts the line                          of
 abscissas         with       slope         corresponding to repulsions for less distances
 and      attractions for greater, and shows zero-force for all distances
 not less than         J  £        2.
   §    65.      To investigate moduluses of elasticity,                            we must suppose the
 forces       applied from without                       to the     points on the boundary to                      be
 such as to produce homogeneous                             strain throughout                  the assemblage.
 The working              out of this statical problem, to be given in                                  a   future
 communication, shows that the solid                                so   constituted       is    not elastically
 isotropic;         but that, on the contrary,                      it   has essentially two different
rigidities.              It   is    in fact       a   cubical       isotropic        body with          its       two
rigidities (article "Elasticity," Ewyclopcedia Britannka, ninth edi
tion, or vol. iii. of my Collected Papers) not equal.  An extension
of the investigation                        to include      the supposition of forces                   not only
between nearest neighbours, but between                                        nearest    and next nearest
neighbours             and none farther, gives of course                                 the    two rigidities
generally not equal; but                       it   allows them to be equalised by                     a   certain
definite relation between forces and variations of forces at the two
distances          £   and     £    v/2.        Imposing          this condition, we have elastic
isotropy      ;    and   I    lind the compressibility to be essentially                               ^   of the
rigidity.            The       solid         thus     constituted          is     therefore        subject         to
Poisson's restriction                   ;    and    it   will     no     doubt      be found           that this
restriction         is   valid for any single equilibrated homogeneous                                 distribu
tion of points, with mutual forces                                  according        to        Boscovich,         and
sphere of influence not limited to nearest and next^nearest                                                 neigh
bours, but extending to any large, not infinite, number of times the
distance between nearest neighbours.
  §    G6.    Having thus failed                    to produce      a    solid free from Poisson's re
striction, go back to the very simplest                                case,    and try for another way
of leaving its simplicity                      by which           we may succeed.                 Try first to
realise       an     incompressible                 elastic solid.             When this          is   done       we
shall     sec,     by an inevitably                 obvious modification, how to give any
degree of compressibility we please                               without         changing the rigidity,
and     so to realise          an elastic solid             with any given positive rigidity,
and any given positive or negative                                  bulk-modulus           (stable without
any surface constraint, only when the bulk-modulus is. positive).

    § 67. To aid conception, make a tetrahedronal model of six equal
straight rods, jointed at the angular points in which three meet,
each having longitudinal elasticity with perfect anti-flexural rigidity.
These constitute merely an ideal materialisation                 of the connection
assumed      in the Boscovich attractions and repulsions.             A    very telling
realisation of the system thus imagined is made by taking six equal
and similar bent bows and jointing their ends together by threes.
The jointing might           be done   accurately by     a ball and double socket
mechanism of an obvious kind, but it would                       not be worth the
doing.       A rough arrangement of six bows of bent              steel wire, merely
linked     together     by hooking an end of one into rings on the ends of
two    others, may be made           in  a few minutes ; and even           its defects
are not unhelpful          towards a vivid understanding             of our subject.
We      have     now an element of elastic solid which                clearly has an
essentially definite ratio of compressibility to reciprocal of either of
the rigidities (§ 27 above), each being inversely proportional to the
stiffness of the bows.           Now we can obviously make this solid incom
pressible     if  we take a boss     jointed to four equal tie-struts, and joint
their   free ends to the four corners           of the tetrahedron       ;  and we do
not alter either of the rigidities if the length of           each tie-strut is equal
to distance from centre to corners of the unstressed                tetrahedron.      If
the tie-struts are shorter than this, their effect is clearly to augment
the rigidities      ;   if longer,   to diminish     the rigidities.       The mathe
 matical investigation proves           that  it diminishes      the greater     of the
rigidities more than it diminishes the less, and that before it annuls
the less it equalises the greater to it.
     § 68.   If  for the present we confine our attention to the case of the
 tie-struts longer than the un-strained distance from centre to corners,
 simple struts        will   serve ; springs, such as bent bows, capable              of
 giving thrust       as  well  as pull along the     sides  of the tetrahedron,      are
 not needed       ; mere    india-rubber    elastic filaments will serve instead,
 or ordinary spiral springs, and all the end-jointings                 become     much
 simplified.       A   realised model accompanies this communication.
     § 69.   The model being completed,             we    have  two simple homo
 geneous Bravais assemblages            of points  ;   reds and blues, as we shall
 call them for brevity         ; so placed  that each blue is in the centre of         a
 tetrahedron of reds, and each red in the centre                   of a tetrahedron
 of blues.        The other tetrahedronal         groupings (Molecular          Tactics,

 724         Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
§§45, 60) being considered each tetrahedron of reds is vacant                    of
blue, and each tetrahedron of blues is vacaut of reds.*
    § 70.  Imagine the springs removed and the struts left; but now             all
properly jointed by fours of ends with perfect frictionlesa            ball-and-
socket triplo-jointa     We have      a perfectly non-rigid three-dimensional
skeleton frame-work, analogous to idealised plane netting consisting
of stiff straight sides of hexagons           perfectly jointed in threes of
 ends.
    § 71.  Leaving mechanism now, return to the purely ideal mutually
attracting points of Boscovich.
    The group is placed at rest in simple equilateral homogeneous
distribution   : — shortest distance     £. It will be  in stable equilibrium,
constituting a solid with the compressibility,         and the two rigidities
referred to in § 27 above.          Condense it to a certain degree to be
found by measurements made on the Boscovich curve, and it will
become unstable.       Let   there be some means        of consuming energy,
or carrying away energy        ;  and it will fall into a stable      allotropic
condition.     The Boscovich        curve may be such that this condition
is the configuration of absolute minimum energy ; and may be such
that    this  configuration    is the double homogeneous        assemblage       of
reds and blues described above.              Though    marked red and blue,
to avoid circumlocutions,        these points are equal and       similar in   all
qualities.
    The mathematical investigation          must be deferred for a future
communication, when         I  hope to give it with some further develop
ments.
   * An interesting structure    is suggested by adding another homogeneous
assemblage,  marked green ; giving a green in the centre of eacli hitherto
vacant tetrahedron of reds.      It is the same aasemblage of triplets as that
described in § 24 above.   It does not (as long as we have mere jointed struts
of constant length between the greeus and reds) modify our rigidity-modulus,
nor otherwise help us at present, so, having inevitably noticed it, we leave it.

Continued Observations on the Progression and Rotation
        of Bivalve Molluscs and of detached Ciliated Portions
        of them. By D. M 'Alpine, Esq.                   Communicated by Dr
        Sims   Woodhead.        (With two Plates.)
               Part II. — In Fresh- Water Mussel (Unio).
                                    (Abstract.)
                                (Read May 6, 1889.)
    In   the fresh-water mussel the general results are much              the same
as  in Mytilus.      Movement of the animal is as a whole right-handed
and slightly forward, though this          iB not invariably    the    case.
    The     movement    appears to   be brought      about by the contraction
and expansion of the foot, which is wedge-shaped,                   and larger in
proportion than in the sea-mussel.              When portions         are detached,
however, the same four parts,           or pieces of them, exhibit decided
movement as in the sea-mussel.                The palps rotate,      the gills and
mantle-lobes also move, but remarkably slowly, while the ventral
margin of the foot is pre-eminently active            ; it is par     excellence the
highly motile      detached    portion.     Where not otherwise stated, the
palps, gills, and mantle-lobes are always laid out with their inner
surface uppermost, and for convenience            of diagrammatic representa
tion, as well    as  for clearness   of explanation,      the  palps are always
supposed to start from the half-round of the clock face.                Thus right-
handed rotation will have           the successive      positions of quarter to,
hour, quarter past, ending with original position at half past.
     I. The Labial Palps         are somewhat      transverse,    triangular    flaps
on each side      of the mouth, situated      between    the anterior adductor.
Each pair of polyps, on either side of the mouth,                is united along
the line of attachment of the body, and this forms a groove between
them       leading to the mouth       ; they are fawn-coloured,          and finely
 striated on their apposed faces.
     1.  Right Labial       Palps, together rotate slowly to the left at
 different rates,   from one round in 6 hours to one in 21 minutes ;
 there is also slight forward movement.
     2. Tlie   Inner Palps       rotate   in opposite directions,         the right
 rotating left-handed, and the left right-handed            ; the left inner palp

  being relatively the weaker, — the right moving           at  an average    rate
 of about    one round   in about  14 J minutes,     and continuing for     about
  10 days, the left moving      considerably more slowly, and (jontinuin.:
  for over   7 days.
     3. Outer Palps. — The right is very fitful in its movement,               and
 varies considerably in different cases, both        as regards rate    of  move
 ment and direction of rotation        ;   but the typical specimen        rotates
 slowly left-handed, at an average rate of one round in            8J   minutes    :
 this    movement      going  on for      52    hours,  the rate    of   rotation
 diminishing gradually to one round in 3 hours and 10 minutes.
 The left invariably rotates right-handed, and the average              rate   was
 one round     in 5  minutes.
     4.  Labial Palps generally. — The palps, normally, rotate inwards
 or towards their attached margin, and both on the same side rotate
 in the    same direction.     In  some      cases abnormal     rotation   occur*
 away from the attached margin.            The rate varies from 5 minutes        to
 14| minutes per round.         The two outer palps seem to be possessed
 of nearly equal     motive power, while of the two inner, the right is
 relatively twice as powerful as the left.        The duration of movement
is usually about      a week,  but the right inner continued for 10 days.
 It must be remembered,       however, that when visible         or even micro
 scopic movement of the palp has ceased, the cilia are            still in active
 motion.
    The constancy of direction of the palps was well maintained.
The     right inner    and left outer never varied        from their     normal.
The right outer, in four recorded specimens,            rotated in its normal
left-handed direction, but one of them (the first too) began right-
handed.       The left inner also rotated normally right-handed in four
specimens,     but one of them on the fifth day was found moving in the
reversed    direction.
    It  would be interesting to determine how far the rotation of the
palps of the Swan Anodon           of Britain (Anodonta         cygnea)    agrees
with the     above.
    II. Gills. — The    entire right outer gill moves extremely slowly in
the direction of its cut surface    (\   inch in   5 days), and thero is slight
rotation of the anterior end.       There is no movement of the left gill
at all.    A  piece of the left inner     gill in  one  case exhibited     slight
forward movement (1 inch in 24 hours), a second                moved forwards

1888-89.]           Mr D. M' Alpine        on Bivalve Molluscs.                727
and rotated through         a quarter of a circle on its posterior end           in
2  \  hours.      A piece of the left outer      gill rotated round the posterior
end, whilst a second portion travelled about -| inch in 3 hours.
     The sluggish movements of the entire gill in Unio contrast strongly
with    those   in Mytilus.      It  may be that more       extended observation
will   reveal a greater      capacity for movement,        bat the gill certainly
does not possess that readiness            of movement characteristic of the
sea-mussel.
     III.   Mantle-Lobes. — Both           right   and left    mantle-lobes   were
detached and laid down with their inner or ciliated                surface   upper
most, but no movement of any kind was detected.                   Then    the Tight
from another mussel was laid down with the                  outer or nnn-eiliated
surface uppermost, and it moved away gently at once.                 It progressed
in the direction of its cut         surface,  rotated around its posterior end
(the opposite of the right outer gill), and travelled \ inch in 6 hours.
Finely powdered charcoal placed upon the inner surface of the mantle
was carried towards the free ventral margin and posteriorly.                   Two
small pieces were taken from the body of the mantle, the one (a)
with its inner surface uppermost, the other (b) with its outer
 surface uppermost.           The     latter  was    taken from a thin part of
 the mantle, and moved          ;   while the former (a), which was thicker,
 did not move.
      The    movement (b) was exceedingly slow, and could only be
 registered at distant intervals.             In 15| hours (at night) it had
 only covered            of  an inch, but     in  three   hours during the day it
 travelled an equal distance.             In   27 hours    from the start it had
 progressed       exactly half    an inch     altogether.    After this it moved
 laterally    as well    as forward, so the exact distance traversed cannot
 be given.
      A strip of the muscular free margin, about, one inch in length,
 was next detached from the posterior end.              The two ends immediately
 came together,       and   a  coil was     formed, but there was       no  further
 movement       ;  while a similar piece from the anterior end remained
 perfectly still.
      The muscular margin was then              cut up into    very small pieces,
 about    -J of an inch in length.         These fragments were       observed   for
  several days, and only exhibited            a  very slight change     of position
 from day to day.           There was      an evident absence     of that motive

728              Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh          .        [aa.
 power which enabled similar pieces of the sea-mussel to roam                    about
 in all directions.
    It   will   be observed that the        mantle-lobe,    in whole or in         part,
 moved with its outer or non-ciliated surface uppermost.
    IV. Foot. — The         foot   is dark grey in colour         and keel-shaped.
 It  is capable     of considerable expansion, and possesses great flexi
 bility.    Within the shell it is wedge-shaped, but when protruded
it may enlarge        to almost the size of the shell,           2 \  inches from      a
shell measuriug        2| inches in length.        Particles    placed on the free
ventral     margin are carried inwards           towards the body and then
posteriorly.       Although the entire detached foot               does    not  move,
the    ventral     margin     is highly motile.        A small strip from            the
anterior      end moved forward           1£  inch    in   5   minutes.      A    piece
detached       from   the central      portion   of    the margin       moved       and
wriggled about in various directions.               Both ends were very sensi
tive, and in its contortions it travelled all over the plate.
    A strip from the whole margin moved irregularly over the                    plate,
covering 11 inches in         7| hours.     Every part of the ventral margin —
anterior, middle, and posterior — was seen under the microscope to
be   richly ciliated.
    The anterior end of the foot moved in the direction                    of the  free
margin, rotating right-handed, 1£ inch forward and § inch to the
left.    It would follow from the ciliary current being inward and
posterior on the foot,          that it would, when detached,          move    in   the
opposite direction, or towards the free margin.                It  is probable that
the direction, when necessary,           can be reversed,     as indicated     in   the
forward      and    backward       movement     mentioned       above.      And    this
applies not only to the palps and foot, but possibly to the gills
iiud    mantle-lobes    ;   for Tryon,     in his Structural        awl Systematic
Concholoyy, mentions a common case                of the " inhalent " becoming
an " exhalent
                   " current : — " If an Anodonta be
                                                             placed in a vessel of
water into which some fine sand is introduced, the particles                   will  be
seen entering the incurrent siphon, and repelled from the orifice of
the excurrent one         ;  but after the animal        has had enough of the
unpalatable and irritating food,          it will  close its valves, forcing        out
the water, and with it the sand."

     Ostrea glomerata, Glas.; 0. edulis, Linn., var. purpurea, Hanley.
     In   the oyster the left valve of the shell is thick and convex                      ;
it is on this side that        the oyster usually rests.            When unattached,
however, there is          some difference       of opinion        as   to  its position.
In     a recent number of Nature (12th April 1888) a summary of
a    Report from the British Consul at Baltimore on the Oyster
Fisheries of Maryland             is given, in which            the oyster is said      to
 feed    twice    a day, always at       the still moment preceding the turn
 of the tide; and         at no other time, except when feeding,                or rather
taking in       food,  docs   it  open    its shell.     It  feeds on the liquor       in
the shell, this habit necessitating the convex or left valve being
 lower, to retain the liquor in sufficient quantity.
     Even when the shell is              closed    the liquid       inside will    be   in
 circulation,      owing to     the action of        the    cilia, but     with  the im
 portant     difference   that the energy of the cilia, under these circum
 stances, is probably less, for,         as   will  be  fully shown in the        sequel,
 the cilia-bearing       part can increase        or decrease the expenditure of
 energy.       Professor Semper mentions (Animal Life, p. 147) having
 eaten oysters, which although with a salt flavour and bathed with
  brackish water at high tide, at ebb tide were surrounded with                          a
  rapid stream      of drinkable      fresh water, and opened            their shells to
  it    He gives      a drawing     of this oyster      living in      spots where the
  water is quite fresh, and it is noteworthy that he should find that
  these oysters opened         their valves at the          turn of the tide.        The
  most   highly prized     oysters   in New South Wales             are likewise   those
  taken    from beds where fresh and salt water mingles at                        certain
  seasons of the year.          The movements of the parts of the oyster
  may help to explain some of its habits and to show the differences
  between the lower and upper side.               In the following brief account
  of the three motile parts        —   palps, gills, and mantle-lobes — as well
  as of the entire shell-less animal, the rock oyster will always have
  precedence, since      the results were decided           and satisfactory on the
   whole ; the movements of the mud oyster                    will   be added    as con
  firmatory.      Any   general   description of parts is likewise given from
   the rock oyster.

rock oysters, although usually known under several different names,
are    now    by most conchologists           admitted     to   be    only    localised
varieties of one and the same species, Ostrea glomerate."                     The best
oysters    are obtained from the shallowest              beds, and the very best
are dry at low water.           The mud oyster of New Zealand,                  as   well
as    of Australia,     is 0. edulis, Linn.,       var.   purpurea,       Hanley    ;   O.

Hector     of New       Zealand, that the common name of mud oyster
given in Hutton's          Manual     is misleading,     and ought rather to be
the deep-water oyster of New Zealand, since                   it is found in from
3 to 12    fathoms of water, and usually on a shelly bottom.
     Movements     of  the Oyster as     a ichole. — A specimen of the oystc-r
laid out in pure salt water, with the gills fully expanded in front
 and posteriorly,       was   found     to have moved to            the left     at    the
 posterior    end    1  inch   in   8£ hours ;     while    the hooded         head, or
 anterior end,      remained     relatively    fixed,   as   it  is  too shut       in to
 allow the free play of the cilia.          After    a time the     gills were drawn
 in, and the whole animal shrunk considerably.
      Labial  Pal)>*.
                       — The labial palps       are a pair of roughly triangular
 or fan-shaped bodies of a pale flesh colour lying on each side of
 the mouth      ; the   inner and outer on each aide passing respectively
 into the lower and upper lips.            When      detached     its shape is often
  lost completely.        The line of attachment to the body is somewhat
  inclined to its long axis, and is just a continuation to the angle of
  the mouth of the line of attachment of the gills.
      Of the palps together, the left was comparatively inactive,
   whilst the right exhibited considerable activity.                        The outer
   rotated right-handed,       taking    42i minutes for the first round, and
   an average     of 23 minutes for the whole, and 3 minutes for the
   quickest    round.      The inner      began     to rotate right-handed            very
   slowly.    It  then reversed      its direction     of rotation       several times,
   always moving very slowly.             The left inner        palp     rotated right-
   handed, and gradually         left the outer palp, which was stationary.
   The first round took 36 minutes, after which the motion was very
   slow indeed, and was not recorded.              The two inner palps together
   with left uppermost gave evidence of very slight left-handed rota
   tion.   Of the right palps, the inner rotates left-handed pretty

constantly, but the rate varied considerably in the different speci
mens.       One specimen with the outer surface uppermost began                        to
move bodily to the right and to rotate right-handed                       ;   the first
round was         as    usual tho     slowest, taking       19 J minutes,    the  30th
taking only          3 minutes.      Next morning it took          16 minutes.       On
the 3rd day, 38 minutes;               on the 4th, 101 and 13        J  minutes;      on
the 6th day three rounds took 5, 91, and 101 minutes respectively;
on the 8th           day lateral    movement was observed,           but no definite
rotation and no further movement was noted.                      Another    specimen,
with the inner surface uppermost, on the 2nd day was rotating
left-handed at a rate of a round in 21 minutes ; on the 6th day
in    If    to    2 J   minutes, now       right-handed;       on the 7th      day the
movement became much slower, and was again left-handed and more
irregular, and it now began to move in a straight line.                   The move
ments       ended      on tho 9th       day.    Ileckoning from the last of tho
 continuous rotation to the last of the recorded rounds, after which
there was       a   little left-handed rotation, the time         was exactly    1  day
 6  hours 52 minutes, so that the palp had been rotating more or
less continuously          for nearly   8 days    of 24 hours each.
    On the 10th          day, examining under the microscope,          the cilia were
 seemingly as active           as  ever,  but there was no movement of the
palp;      on the 11th day,          however, left-handed        rotation was again
 resumed       after renewal of the sea water, and half a round was
 completed, and the palp had moved jj of an inch higher up.                           On
the 12th day another              round was completed, one            quarter during
 the night, the other during the day, that of the night taking about
 10 hours, and that of the day about 9 hours.                     During tho night
 there was little change           of position while rotating, but during the
 day, or last quarter round, there was a deal of                  progressive    move
 ment combined with the rotation.                   In  less than 2 hours the      half
 of the last quarter            round was about completed when the                 palp
began      to move in a curve in the direction of the tip, with very
little if any rotation for           some    time.     Tho distance thus traversed
 varied for different periods of the course.              The entire curve measured
 about    2| inches, while for          a given period of 1} hour the distance
 was   -^g  of an inch, and for the last          2  hours 22 minutes it was       {j  of
 an inch.         At the     close of the round        the  palp was almost exactly
 11  inch to the left of its first position, and the same lower down.

    On the 13th day the curve of progression                        was    not   passed
through, and movement ceased altogether on the 14th day.
    The right inner         palp,    with     a   renewal     of   water once,        w»e
actually engaged in rotation for the space of                  11   days, and,     if  the
rotating     detached palps of          oyster and sea-mussel           were    kept in
constantly moving sea water,            it is hard    to say how long      they migh:
not continue their movements.
    The day after rotation ceased the palp was examined under the
microscope,      and the cilia were still in active motion except at the
tip   end, where the long       cilia moved but sluggishly, and were almost
still.    Now that rotation had ended the next point to determine
was, how long the
                          " ciliary   motion
                                                "
                                                  might last after such a display
of energy.       On the 15th day,          as just mentioned,        the  cilia were in
motion all round,          but most actively          in the curved part.           Here
material was being passed along in the direction of the arrow and
thrown off at the anterior end.                Later on, this end was fonnd to
move a     little backward, while the tip end remained fixed.
    On the morning of the 16th day the anterior end was found to
have moved back nearly             \  inch, while      the  tip end was stationary.
Microscopic appearances          explained this, for ciliary motion was now
seen to be confined to the curve a, where the               cilia  were   still working
actively.       On the evening of the           same day no further          movement
had taken place, only a slight movement at the tip end.                      Under    the
microscope,      the tip was seen to have tucked itself in a little (hence
the motion), and the cilia were still active in the curve, more particu
larly towards the very anterior             end.     On the morning of the 17th
day, there was no change of position,                and under the microscope no
 ciliary motion was        observed.       The cilia stood       out like a fringe in
 the curve, perfectly still      ;  the cilia had thus ceased to move not all
 round at once, but in patches, as it were, and as far as observed in
 the specimen in the following order               : — At the tip      end first, round
 the outer margin next, and on the attached margin nearest to die
 mouth last of all, where the cilia had a powerful appearance.
     The ciliary motion lasted at          least  up to the evening of the 16th
 day,    whilo the rotatory motion ended on the 14th day. And
  taking the last observation for the ciliary motion, it exceeded tbt
 other by 2 days       9  hours.
     The palp, as    it lies in    the clear sea water,       still retains its   colour.

or    decay.
     Three specimens        were taken from the mud oyster,           but the move
 ment was quite          insignificant,    though it was always           left-handed,
•commencing        slowly, and gradually attaining the speed of one round
in   2 J minutes, after which       the movement was gradually lost, the same
 irregularities      as in the left inner palp, though           less marked, being
still    observed.       A   specimen from         a   mud oyster exhibited         no
 rotatory    motion, but       it  progressed     about    \  an inch, and altered
its   shape most materially.          A   left inner palp rotated right-handed
.at   once,   and after moving          upwards for a little, the tip became
 stationary, and it rotated regularly, the tip being elevated and bent
 back upon the body of the palp, pointing                 in  an opposite direction
 to that of the movement.            The slowest of fifty rounds was done in
                                            J
 •ii minutes, and the quickest in 2 minutes, the general average giving
one round in        Z\  minutes.      At the end of fifty rounds the palp          was
¦only   § inch lower down, and          \  inch to the left of the original posi
 tion. This rotation continued for 24 hours. In the mud oyster the
 movement was very indefinite.
     In   Hie    left   outer path      the    rotation    was right-handed        and
  very   irregular,     but   it continued      for    over 53     hours.      Another
specimen, tried with the outer surface uppermost, at first moved
 laterally to the right and with slight rotation to the left               ; the speed
 steadily increasing, the slowest round taking                62 minutes, the last
 and quickest (when movement was accidentally stopped) 1\ minutes.
  Being again started it began to move bodily to the right, and after
 a little irregular movement this was continued, attaining a speed of
 one round     in  3 J minutes,    and an average of one round in         6| minutes.
 This continued, gradually diminishing               in speed, until the fifth day,
 when two complete            rounds were       followed,    taking   14   J  and 23f
 minutes respectively.            Shortly after, the palp      reached     the margin
of the water, where it remained.
     A  specimen from a mud oyster moved upwards, and rotated right-
 handed, but very slightly.            During the       second   and third days it
 moved very little to the right,               without any turning,          and then
 ceased.
    Palps generally. — When the palps of either side were laid down
together they rotated in the direction of their cut margins, and

734            Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                    [sea.
when the palps were taken separately they still followed the same
direction, with the exception of the right outer palp.                     But it will
bo remembered that          it  also   rotated left-handed        as well    as  right-
handed, with its inner surface uppermost, so that, generally speak
ing, the palps may be said to rotate in the direction                    of their cut
margins.      And since the palps rotate generally in this direction, it
might be     assumed that the cilia work in the opposite way, and this
is found     to be the    case.     Thus it is no uncommon sight to see
matter sweeping across          the palp, whilst it is rotating from the
attached to the free margin, there to be got rid of, and this shows
 unmistakably      in what direction          the cilia   act,    at  least   on that
 surface.    Having settled these          two general facts, that the palp.<
 rotate usually in the direction of their cut margins, and that the
 cilia work in the opposite direction, we may now enter a little into
 detail.
     Of the two right palps            the   inner   is particularly       active and
 persistent, going at the average rate of             2J minutes per round, and
 continuing its movements for 13 days, while the outer has likewise
 a good   record of  3  minutes per round.          The direction of rotation in
 both is slightly variable.
     Of  the  two left   palps,     the  inner    is more    active,    going at the
 average rate of 3 minutes per round ;              while the outer is not only
 slower, but the slowest of all the palps.             There was here also varia
 tion in direction     of rotation, and it may be assumed                 that all the
 palps are capable of it.
     The palps on the two sides of the body are thus pretty evenly
 balanced,    as far as movement is concerned,             but the advantage on
 the whole evidently      lies with the right side.
     Function. — In detached palps it is very               easy to      observe    the
 direction in which      matters are carried by them.              In   the course   of
 rotation it was observed,          more    particularly   in the left inner and
 left outer palp, both lying as they naturally               do with their inner
 surface    uppermost.       In   the left outer the dirty matter was sent
  spinning across from the inner to the outer margin, where it formed
  into slimy threads along the outer edge.             There    it gradually    became
  parted off from the body of the palp, separating from the tip end
  first, and latterly   it formed       a streamer,    carried round by the re
  volving palp.      Ultimately the matter          was got    rid of entirely, and

the    same process was repeated                 as occasion       arose.    In the left inner,
matter was also seen passing rapidly across from the inner to the
outer margin, gradually getting loosened from the body of the palp,
and ultimately        being thrown               off from the tip backward.                    There
was none of that literal shaking off of rubbish                               met    with in the
palp of Mytilus, but it              separated          almost insensibly.           In   the face
of the    above facts,    it   does sound strange to read in a lecture delivered
by Professor Huxley             at the   Koyal Institution, on " Oysters and the
                  (English Illustrated Magazine, vol. i. p. 52) —

Oyster Question
"The anterior ends of each pair of heuii-branchiaj are attached
between the two palps of the side to which                                  they belong.            The
applied surfaces of the palps, between which lies the commencement
of the mouth-cleft,        are ridged and               richly ciliated,      so that anything
brought by the ciliary current of the gills is led directly into the
oral     cavity."    Instead         of that, it is generally led directly away
from     it,   and we have already seen that in the sea-mussel                            it   is   the
same when attached, so that the onus of proof must rest with those
who make such         a   statement       as the above,           in future.
   The larval oyster            is   unprovided            with     palps, and so         it   would
seem     to have its mouth unprotected at an age when such protection
was most needed.            But      there   is   an apparent substitute             for them on
the relatively large           oval ciliated disc or velum, which overlies the
larval mouth.         Whatever           development may say                  as    to the future
of the velum,        it   probably functions                partly in the larva, as do the
palps in the adult, i.e., in addition                        to the    locomotive, and pos
sibly respiratory, function,              it      has      the    function    of guarding           the
mouth against unsuitable food                    as   it   swims about with its velum in
front.         And thus the      suggestion           of Loven, that the velum becomes
the palps, may at least have                 a   functional basis.
   It    may be suggested              that the palps act both as guards and
guides to the mouth, seeing                  that they can vary their direction of
rotation, and consequently the direction of the ciliary current, the
latter when         feeding, and the               former at other times.                 Still     the
unguarded statement must not henceforth be made, that the cilia
of the palps act constantly and mechanically                                in the direction of
the mouth.
   Since the palps are all capable                         of reversing       the    direction       of
their rotation, and since            a   palp (the right inner) has been actually

observed      to send materials towards the mouth end when detached,
it is rendered extremely probable that the palps in the oyster
exercise the double function of guarding the mouth, and of guiding
food materials towards           it,   at the proper time.
  Right Inner GUI-Plate. — In the rock oyster the entire gill exhibited
only faint indication of movement in the direction of its cut
surface.      Pieces of the gill-plate              of the mud oyster laid on               the
inner surface moved forward and to the left, then one began                                  to
rotate on its anterior end, then the posterior end became the                             pivot
and in 57 minutes       it    had returned to its original transverse                position,
but to the left and about                   one     inch    higher up.        Placed in its
original     position again, the movements were exactly reversed.                            It
retained very slight power of movement for five days.
     Right Outer Gill-Plate— (a) Entire                      rock    oyster. — The move
ments were very irregular and slight, the only definite result being
that the gill-plate moved as whole -fe inch in
                                        a        hours, (6) Pieces   6
of the corresponding             gill-plate       of the mud oyster exhibited no
movement of any kind.
     Left Inner Gill-Plate — (a) Entire rock oyster. —One                            specimen
moved in the direction of the cut surface, moving more at the ends
than at the centre.              It    thus       moved forward            in this   irregular
manner             of an inch          in   4     hours 50 minutes.           The free    edge
travelled     1^ inch, whilst the cut              edge had worked through only             \\
inch during the same              period,          (b) Pieces       (of mud     oyster)   gave
absolutely negative results.
 Ijeft Outer Gill-Plate — (o) Entire rock oyster. — Beyond slight
movement in the direction of the cut surface, there was no change
in position,  (b) Pieces (mud oyster). A small piece half an inch
in length, completed revolution in hours 12 minutes, and moved
                            a                        3
slightly forward       as   a   whole   ;    the third and fourth quarter revolu
tions were performed in 30 and 32 minutes respectively.
     Mantle- Lobes.   — Each mantle-lobe of the oyster contracts                     consider
ably on being separated               from the shell, hence on the opened                  side
it   is   greatly shrunken, but         it   may be removed           from the remaining
valve in      a   fair condition for laying                out.     Thus    the mantle-lobe
when detached         has not the compact form                    of that of Mytilus,       hot
is   elongated,     curved,      more        or    less    puckered, and        the portion
extending from the mouth end,                      and sweeping round the adductor

muscle, is much broader than the remainder.                    The   one end          will   be
called     the   anterior   and the other            the posterior, for purpose              of
description.       The mantle-lobe is attached during life to the inside
of the valve.       In    the right mantle-lobe of the rock oyster there was
not the slightest movement, whilst there was only slight movement
of the two ends of the left when its lobe                   was laid down            with its
cut surface      uppermost.      It   appeared        as though   the contraction of
the centre brought about curling inwards of the two ends.
  Pieces of the mascular margin about a quarter of an inch in
length can turn on themselves and change                    their position to a very
alight extent.
  If   the movements of the throe forms, Mytilus, Unio, and Ostrea,
be compared in their natural condition, Unio possesses the greatest
activity, and Ostrea,        as far as known, the least ; but            if    the progres
sive and rotatory movements due to cilia are in question, then
Mytilus undoubtedly          takes the lead.          Unio, with its relatively         large
keel-shaped foot, can move along, either upright or on its side, in a
way that neither Mytilus, with its byssus-secreting foot, nor Ostrea,
without a foot at all, can approach             ;    but when the animal, divested
of its shell, is placed in its            native element,         there        is,   perhaps,
contrary to expectation,         a    power     of     progression   and rotation in
Mytilus      only slightly shared        by Unio, and almost absent from
Ostrea.
   The general table will show          at   a      glance the contrast between the
nature, direction, and rate of movement in each of the various parts                          ;
and   it   will likewise    be noticed that each           of the three forms has             a
distinct and specially active part, suggestive of underlying differ
ences.   There   the gill in Mytilus, the ventral margin of the
                     is
foot in Unio, and the labial palp in Ostrea.                  In Mytilus,        no doubt,
the palps are specially active, but they are eclipsed in rapidity and
readiness of movement by the gills, so that the latter form the
more prominent motile parts.
   Palps.    — The palps have all         a combined          rotatory        and progres
sive motion, normally,          in the direction          of the cut margin.                 As
between Mytilus and            Unio, the main difference lies in the two
fellow palps on either side of the former, rotating in opposite direc
tions, and in the latter in the same direction.   Ostrea may be said
to agree with Mytilus, only the left outer or lowermost palp rotates

738                Proceedings            of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                                     [as-
like ite fellow, or it may be said to agree with Unio, in the palps of
both sides rotating alike, only the right outer or uppermost can
turn either way, by preference,                        the opposite to that of Unio.                          The
rate on the whole is                     in favour of the              oyster,   the general average
being    Z\ minutes per round                      ;   next comes Mytilus, with                     a    general
average of 4           ;    and lastly Unio, with            a general average of 8J. It will
be remarked that                       the average         of the corresponding palps agree
pretty closely in Ostrea and Mytilus, and that it is the left outer
which is the slowest in both.
    GUU. — As regards the movement of the gills in their entirety,
there is hardly any comparison between those of Mytilus and the
other two.             All        agree indeed         in moving, and in moving                          in. the
direction of the cut margin, but beyond that they have little                                                      in
common.             The          noticeable     feature in the gill                of Mytilus is its
readiness,         when detached               and laid          out, to move              away     ;    and       so
energetic      is it that even the anatomists have not failed to notice
the swimming movement of parts of                                it,   and as far as known to me,
this   is    the only mollusc in which such has been noticed.                                           It   is   the
only part of any mollusc examined so far which can be absolutely
relied       upon to move                  steadily        and immediately              when detached,
hence its great suitability for investigations                                   concerning cilia and
their movements.
    The palps              as    a   rule could be trusted to rotate after                      a   longer or
shorter resting period; but                   it   was noticeable           in    the      oyster, that            of
the    two fellow palps detached from either side, only one of them
usually rotated, so much so, that after spending much time at first in
detaching single specimens,                 I    got into the habit latterly of detaching
and laying out two together,                    with the sure and certain hope that
one of them, at least, would not disappoint me
    The average                  rate of movement for the gills                  of the sea-mussel                 is
2   minutes per inch for those of the fresh-water mussel                                    ;   there        is   no
general average,                 but \   inch done in         3   hours; and for those of the
oyster       the    average            of about 13 minutes per              \     of an inch, or 85
minutes for one measured                      inch     ;   or, to express        it   in   a   comparative
way,     1   inch      is       traversed by the       gill of Mytilis, Ostrea, and Unio in
2   minutes,       1
                   \        hours, and 24 hours respectively.
    As   there was no definite progressive                        movement of the entire lobe
observed in the oyster, the comparison lies between the sea and                                              fresh

1888-89.]          Mr D. M' Alpine on Bivalve Molluscs.                         739
water mussel.        There was rotation       as well as progression       in both,
but   if  we compare     the latter, then the mantle-lobe of Mytilus has
the decided advantage.           That of Mytilus went      at the rate of    1 inch
in   50 minutes, and that of         Unio an inch in 24 hours.            The foot
of Mytilus is     so entirely different from that of     Unio that comparison
will not beattempted. Suffice it to say, that the slow-moving, definite-
shaped,     steadily directed foot of Mytilus, when attached, is a perfect
contrast to the same when detached,            while the     free   margin of the
foot of Unio appears to possess all the activity of the keel-shaped
 mass.
    The cilia of the sea-mussel are almost instantly             arrested in their
movements by fresh water, just as those of the fresh-water mussel
are by salt water,        but it is interesting; to note that each may be
gradually accustomed         to the changed    conditions.     Professor Semper,
in his Animal Life, mentions the               case of a    Unio living within
reach of the flood tide, of the sea-mussel            in perfectly fresh      water,
and of the edible oyster in brackish               water.     This may help       to
explain how the cilia originally           became   gradually adapted        to salt
water in the one mussel, and fresh water in the other.
    There are still two important considerations suggested by the pre
ceding observations — the resting of the cilia and the relative and
absolute rate of movement of detached            parts.
    It   is pointed out that the cilia are supposed             to continue their
work without any          rest, and   it may   be conceded       that microscopic
examination goes to prove this, but from the observations                  made on
the variation in direction of the movements of              pieces   of gills,  &c,
within very short periods, such           can   scarcely be the       case ; and it
must be argued that different series of cilia are brought into play
at different    times.     It may be imagined, in a structure like the gill,
with its innumerable cilia, that they rest in relays without inter
fering much, if at all, with the general effect ; and I have often had to
point     out, as in the rotating   palps of the oyster, that in the course
 of long spells of rotation they       " rested half a minute " or so. To
the observer this looks exactly like " stopping to take breath," or
the wearied rower laying down his oar for a minute.
    In   the course of these investigations an important distinction was
noticed between the action of the cilia and the movement of the
cilia-bearing     mass.     The movement of the         mass might       cease, and

   740           Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                  [tm,
  yet the cilia themselves,          when     examined under the       microscope,
   would be in active motion.              The cilia in themselves are thus         not
  the cause of movement         ; there has to be    co-operation or co-ordinatioa
  of some sort before the ciliary motion can give rise to movement                    of
  the part bearing the cilia.           There are, therefore, two motions          con
  nected    with cilia     to be   distinguished — one, the ordinary        so-called
  "
    ciliary motion," which creates currents in the liquid, and keeps up
  a   constant stream ; another, which may be called ciliary motive-
 power, which is sufficiently powerful to move the cilia-bearing                mass.
 The practical bearing of the distinction is evident in the              investiga
 tion of the action of drugs, &c, upon ciliary movement                  It  will    be
 necessary     in future, not       only   to   determine    what  arrests ciliary
 motion, but also what affects their motive power, apart               from their
 own proper movement.
     The absolute and relative rate of movement of the detached                parte
 is a subject replete        with interest, and the movements of           the gill
 of the sea-mussel, slow as they may seem when compared                  with      the
 dashing Iufusorian, can actually hold its own; but, as pointed out by
Nageli, quoted by Sachs iu his Lectures on the Physical Plants —
 '
    Whether     the movements       of a body appears      to us rapid    or alow,
however, depends also on the relation between its size and the spacr
passed over in a definite time.            If an  elephant and a mouse travel
an equal distance        in the   same time, we call the first slow, the second
quick.      A   man in walking passes over somewhat more               than    half
his length in one second.              The   most   rapid swarm-cell travels, in
the same time, a distance which is             2| times as great as its diameter.
Judged by this standard, the gill of Mytilus only traverses its own
height in about       a  minute, and so far is relatively slow.
     In both    the Odoutophora and the Lamellibranchiata            the cilia on
the velum cause        a  rotation of the embryo within the egg-capsule,        but
it is   a curious fact that the cilia do not always act             Thus on      the
development of Sepia, it is          noted that " the whole embryo        now be
comes ciliated, though the ciliation does not cause the usual rotation               ;
while, in such a closely allied form           as Loligo, it does occur.    Loligo
differs mainly from Sepia in the early enclosure of the yolk by                 the
blastoderm and in the embryo exhibiting the phenomena of rotation
within the       egg-capsule    so characteristic     of other Mollusca.*      The

ment of Mytilus edidis, L.,              has been      recently and specially studied
      J
by ohn Wilson, Demonstrator of Zoology, University of St Andrews,
and he      has found that         cilia cover    the greater     part of the surface of
the embryo, causing it             to rotate     actively, but no idea is given of
rotation.*
     In  Anodonta and Unio there is likewise rotation of the embryo.                           1
In Unio Jitoralis,         when the rotation is most active,            7  or   8  revolutions
are said to be observed             per minute,J      but this is presumably,           as seen
under the microscope,             and therefore of no value without                 the magni
 fication.      In Anodonta intermedia               the   rotation is at the           rate of
 from     4  to   1   rounds per minute (15 to 79 seconds),§ but the same
 remark probably applies.
     Although the development of                 the   oyster  has been        recently and
 carefully     studied, there         is no mention        of rotation of the embryo
 within     the      egg,   although      there is      a  double oval        ring of cilia.
 Probably it does occur,            as  in the larva of Cardium, which it other
 wise closely resembles.
     The rotation of the embryo in the ovum of the frog is described
 as   being from right to left, at         a rate  of from   5 to 1 2  minutes per round
 (Pfluger's   Archiv, 1870, Heft           2  and 3).      Even at the highest rate, it
 is  slow, as compared          with some of the detached              parts already       con
 sidered,    and with the embryo of Unio,                   for instance.         For proper
  comparison,       however,     the   relative sizes would require to bo taken
  into account.         The rate of rotation, so seldom             given, is worthy         of
  attention,    particularly in a        case   like Mytilus,      where     the adult still
  retains a power only possessed by the embryos of higher forms.
     The movements of the detached                 parts of the three chosen forms
  have   thus yielded valuable results, and to                  a  certain extent these
  forms are    representative for our present purpose.                 There is the free

deep.     The free form, the anchored form, and the attached                form
represent different stages of freedom of movement in the adult

often referred to as the mysterious movements of the cilia.
    Further,   while there are many points of interest suggested               by
 this investigation, the following may perhaps claim special attention            :
 — The    rapidity and readiness      of movement by the gill of Mytilus —
 rapid  as  the free-swimming Infusorian,            and ready at the moment
 of detachment      besides to move, not only horizontally,        but vertically
 and inverted     ;  the duration of movement of the palp of Ostrea               ;
 and the distinction       between ciliary movement and ciliary motive-
 power.
    These facts      are all capable      of being turned to useful account
 apart from the immediate            organisms supplying         and elucidating
 them.
     Strophanthus hispidus — continued: Pharmacological
                  Action. By Dr Thomas R. Fraser.
                                     (Abstract.)
                               (Read   June  3, 1889.)
    Strophanthus       extract and Strophanthin are substances          of great
 pharmacological activity,       as,  by subcutaneous administration, Stro
 phanthin produces death in average-sized frogs with a dose of 4000^
 of a grain, and in rabbits weighing about 3 lbs. with a dose of
                                                            same with both sub
  i^0th of a grain. The kind of action is the
 stances, and therefore       Strophanthin may properly be regarded as
 the active principle of Strophanthus hispidus.               In my preliminary
 communications       I  have  already described the more important char
 acteristics of the action, and,         therefore, to-night     I shall content
 myself with drawing attention to a few only of these characteristics.

    I  have not obtained evidence of any primary action                   on the   brain,
medulla      oblongata,      spinal    cord,   nor   motor nerves.          Sensibility,
however, is slightly affected         ; one   of the most conspicuous evidence
of which is the insensibility           of the cornea following         the application
of dilute solutions to the eye-balL
    In the preliminary communications                I have stated       that the     chief
action is that exerted upon the heart, produced when large toxic
doses are given by a powerful action upon the heart-muscle.
    This action upon the heart-muscle is                  one which       Strophanti na
exerts     upon all the other striped             muscular fibres of          the body.
These muscles are affected              by twitching      movements,      their tonicity
is increased,       and,   finally,    their  contractility      is destroyed.       They
are not then, however, flaccid, soft, and alkaline, but hard and acid
in reaction.        In  fact, the condition of the muscles              is one of rigor
 mortis, in which the alkaline reaction of the living muscle has given
 place to the acid reaction         of rigor ; and, just as the acid reaction              of
 ordinary rigor mortis continues until the muscle becomes flaccid                          in
 the process of putrefaction, so the acid and hard condition produced
 by     the   pharmacological        action of      Strophanthus         remains      until
 putridity     causes    the muscle        again to become          alkaline,   soft, and
 flaccid.     This prevention of the initial muscular flaccidity of                   death
 and precipitation, as it were, of rigor mortis, to which I                            drew
 attention so long ago          as  1870,* has since been recognised by other
 observers     as events      in the pharmacological action of digitalis, and
  of several members of the digitalis group.
      The twitches produced in the muscles                   of the body have          been
  further examined in detached muscles, immersed in normal                            saline
  solution    to which       Strophanthus       had been       added,     and connected
  with    a lever recording the movements on a revolving cylinder.                       Tbt
  movements        in the detached muscle            are thus seen to be very             n-
  markable.       At first    a faint    twitch  occurs    in  an  individual    muscular
  fibre, then simultaneous and independent                    contractions of difierert
  fibres rapidly succeed each other, until by and by a perfect tumult
  of contractions occurs in rapid succession in different muscular                    fibres,
  and the lever attached to the muscle                  is kept in almost         constant
  motion, its excursions being altogether irregular both in time                     and in
  extent.     [Tracings were shown.]             While      the muscle     is so  affected,

electric stimulation of its         motor nerve fails         to cause       any effect.
After the twitching            contractions     have    ceased, the motor           nerve
regains its influence        ;  and the contractions of the entire muscle,
 which are now produced by stimulating                   the nerve,     illustrate     the
 condition      of increased    tonicity    produced by Strophanthus.                 The
 muscle      curve is altogether different from the normal curve.                     The
muscle contracts actively, but, after having contracted,                       it relaxes
with      great   tardiness ;  and it is only after several         revolutions of a
rapidly      revolving    cylinder   that the curve gradually              falls   to the
abscissa.        [Curves were shown.]
     When Strophanthus is administered                 by subcutaneous injection
to a frog,       one of whose muscles,        without otherwise deranging its
 normal       relations, is attached to a lever writing on a revolving
cylinder, similar changes in contractility             are observed,       but they are
less in degree.        [Curves were shown.]
     Owing partly to the circumstance that a larger quantity                       of any
substance introduced into the blood is in any given time conveyed
to     the heart than       to any     other individual         organ     or structure
of the body,           the  action    of   Strophanthus        is exerted       with   the
greatest      energy and activity       upon the heart.          With very minute
doses, its contractions are rendered          slower and more perfect and com
plete    ; and    with larger doses, the diastolic dilatation of its chambers
 is  reduced    until dilatation disappears altogether, and the heart ceases
 to beat because its muscle can no longer relax.                   The condition         of
 the muscle becomes         the same     as  that of the other striped muscles
 under the influence of large doses.            It  is hard, non-contractile under
 stimulation, and acid in reaction, — the condition of true rigor mortis
  having been produced as the ultimate stage in the sequence of events
  in the pharmacological          action of     Strophanthus.         These       changes
  occur even       although    all the nerve       connections of the heart are
  severed,     or the vagus nerve is paralysed by the previous adminis
  tration of atropine.
      The power of an extremely minute quantity of Strophanthus to
  produce these effects on the heart was illustrated in a series of
  experiments, in which           an attempt       was made        to determine the
   minimum        quantity   required    to paralyse       the   frog's heart.         The
   heart was attached        to an   apparatus allowing it to pump from                    a
   reservoir     a fluid   which   sustained its nutrition          for     many hours,

746             Proceedings           of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                            [se».
and to this fluid a certain dose of Strophantus                                was added.           He
apparatus further recorded the individual contractions of the heart,
so as not only to show the rate of contraction, hut also the ampli
tude of each contraction.                   With very minute                doses,     and.    in   the
early stages of the action of larger doses, the contractions became
slower,   and an increased               volume of fluid was projected from the
heart at each contraction.                  It   was found         that when the circulating
fluid contained Strophanthin                     in the proportion of            one part      in   ten
millions, the characteristic changes were produced.                              Even the almost
inconceivably minute dose which was brought in contact                                     with     the
heart when         a   solution of    one    in six millions was used, produced com
plete stoppage of the heart,                 in extreme        systolic contraction,           in lew
than half an hour.              One   jiart in fifteen millions,           one   part in      eighteen
millions, and even one                part in twenty millions               also produced well-
marked effects          ;   but these extreme dilutions did not always arrest the
heart's   contractions, and, as contrasted                     with the changes           produced
by less dilute solutions, the slowing of the heart was due to delay
during its diastole more than during its systole.
     When the exposed heart is observed                        in situ after the administra
tion of Strophanthin,             even      when the dose is only a minimum lethal
one, the changes              that are seen are usually those indicating                       a great
increase in the strength and in the duration of systolic contraction,
and the ultimate standstill                      of the heart        is,   as before     described,
brought about               by the systolic contraction becoming persistent and
passing immediately into rigor mortis.                             This    increased    duration of
contraction, with consequent                     lessening   of the dilatation of the heart
and of the capacity of its chambers,                          is   not, however, the action
which     is   likely       to be serviceable        in weak conditions of the organ or
in   the existence           of disabling lesions.
 I    accordingly made some experiments in which Strophantin                                        was
given in rather less              than minimum lethal doses — in                       some experi
ments by subcutaneous               administration, and in others by direct appli
cation    of   a   solution to the heart's               surface.         When     care was taken
to prevent any irritant, even the air                        in motion, from reaching               the
heart,    a    minute dose            produced slowing              and    a   great    increase        in
the amplitude of dilatation,                     with strong systolic contractions.                  In
some experiments the diastolic pause was so greatly lengthened that
the heart remained motionless for two or three                                 minutes, with its

 ventricle   very large and full of blood;            but   yet the interrupting
 systolic contractions were         strong,    and they completely and          deli
 berately emptied the ventricle of its large accumulation of blood.
 It  was found, however, to be extremely difficult, by any adjustment
 of the dose, to produce         a standstill   of the heart in diastole.       The
 heart either recovered        altogether,    or, in the    course   of time, the
 diastolic pauses became briefer, and the systole predominated until
 the heart ceased to beat in systolic rigidity.
    The experiments demonstrated that with doses below the mini
mum lethal — that is to say, with such doses             as  would be employed
in the therapeutic administration of Strophanthus — both               the diastole
and the systole of the heart were rendered more perfect, and that
the action, therefore,       was greatly to increase      the working      capacity
of the   heart.
    An endeavour      was next made to determine upon what structures
Strophanthus       acts  in order   to produce the changes        that follow the
administration      of doses less than lethal.          The above experiments
were repeated after all the nerve connections of the heart with the
central nervous system had been divided, and also after the vagus
inhibitory apparatus had been paralysed by atropine ; but the action
that has been described was produced equally well after these
modifications had been made.             It could not, therefore,    be explained
by any action on the central nervous               system,    nor on the cardio-
inhibitory influence of       the vagus either    within or outside the      heart.
    As  there are several points      in  the physiology of the heart that yet
remain     unsolved, it would be hazardous to adopt any theoretical
explanation,      without    considerable reserve.        It,  however,     appears
probable that at least two structures are involved in the action of
Strophanthus      on the heart, namely, the muscular fibre itself, and a
portion    of the intra-cardiac nerve apparatus.            The action of Stro
phanthus     upon the muscle of the heart               explains   the prolonged
and strengthened systolic contraction, and the ultimate standstill
in   extreme    systole,   following    the administration      of lethal and of
toxic doses.       The action upon a part of the intra-cardiac                nerve
apparatus explains the increased amplitude of dilatation                   and the
prolonged diastole, which, under nice adjustments of small doses,
 may become permanent, and actually cause a standstill               of  the heart
in extreme     diastole.     The two actions are, in a sense, antagonistic          :

748          Proceedings      of Boyal Society of Edinburgh.             [sss.
and when minute or therapeutic doses are given, the muscle              action
does not assert    itself so conspicuously as the nerve action ;    but  when
the doses are large, the action on the muscle of the heart over-ridei
the less powerful action upon the intra-cardiac nervous structure.
    Whether this latter structure can further he defined by experi
ment or not, the most important consideration is that the action
upon it contributes greatly to enhance the value, for therapeutic par-
poses, of the action      of Strophanthus upon the muscle of the heart :
as  the two actions in combination render the contractions of the
 heart stronger and more          ample than they could be rendered by
 either action alone.
    In thus presenting to        the  Society a synopsis or sketch      of   the
 observations made, during a series of years, on the Natural History,
 Chemistry, and Pharmacology of Strophanthus,             I have endeavoured
 to select  what appear to be the more important of the results that
 have   been   arrived at.     In the pharmacological part of the    observa
 tions these are probably the results that relate to the action upon
 the circulation.    . The nature of this action, determined      by pharma
 cological experiments,      rendered it obvious that Strophanthus       would
 produce beneficial effects in many forms of disease of the heart
 It  was, therefore,   employed for that purpose, and the most sanguine
 anticipations of its value have now been amply confirmed.

     It  is next pointed out that the transformation of the primitive
  permutation into any other may be accomplished by interchange*
  only, because      by this    means   any given letter may be made           to
  occupy the first place, then any other given letter to occupy              the
  second place, and so on.         From this also it follows that any   sjsten
  of circular    substitutions    may be replaced by       a system   of  inter
  changes.      Should     the   transformation   of   one   permutation    into
  another be effected       by interchanges, the number of these will         be

even or odd according           as  the two permutations belong to the same
or different      classes;   for, by the above theorem,            every interchange
makes only one group more or one group less, and consequently the
total number of interchanges, and the net increase or diminution                        of
the    number of groups,            must be both         even    or both     odd.     The
counting      of interchanges       may thus be substituted for the counting
of cycles.
     Finally, Cramer's rule        is introduced,      in which,   as  we know,      it is
neither cycles nor interchanges that are counted, but inverted pairs, or,
as Cauchy,       like Gergonne, calls them,          inversions.      To establish the
rule,   it is clear that two courses were open, viz., to connect inversions
directly     with cycles or        to connect them         with interchanges.         The
latter course is taken, the requisite connecting theorem being that the
interchange of two dements of a permutation increases or diminishes
 tlie number of inversions by an odd number, an odd number of
 interchanges thus corresponding to an odd number of inversions,
 and an even         to an even.        The proof is not direct, like Rothe's,
 being effected with the help of a fourth related entity, the difference-
 product.       The order of thought in it is as follows : —If we define
 the difference-product of the primitive permutation a,                   b,  c, d,  .  . .
 to be
                       (a
                           - b)(a - c)   .  . .  .
                                                    (b-c)   . .  . .,
  then it is clear that in the difference-product of any derived permu
 tation     there   will  be found      exactly as many factors with changed
 sign   as there are    inversions of order in the permutation.                 A  change
 of sign in the difference-product thus becomes a test for the existence
 of an odd number of inversions, and consequently, instead of the
  theorem just enunciated, it will suffice to show that the interchange of
 two elements      of a permutation alters         the sign  of the difference-product.
 This Cauchy says must be true, for, the elements being h and k, it
 is manifest that the factor which involves them both,
                                      h  -k     or    k-h,
  must change sign, but that the factors which involve them and any
  third element s constitute a partial product
                            (h -s)(k-      a)   or   (h-s)(s-k),
  the sign of which cannot change.                                                (in. 37)

     Of     the three memoirs,             the first and third, like Jacobi's third                        and

  Cauchy, unlike Jacobi, makes                     determinants        a    special class of alter
  nating functions, and              it   is   therefore of importance to              see    the         exact
  position he assigns              to them.        It will   be remembered            that       in       1812
  he partitioned            symmetric functions into permanent and alternating,

  reason     being assigned         ;    indeed, there       is   not even       a   word to imply
  that any change had taken place.                     Alternating functions              are, as     in his
   Court    d 'analyse,          put on the same          level      as symmetric            functions;
   the term permanent               is    dispensed with         ;   a new entity, alternating
   aggregates,        is   introduced;         what were formerly called determinants
  are made        a   class   of   these alternating aggregates             ;   and for the name

   Neither      scheme,          we must at the same time remember,                         is   really       as
   simple    as    here       indicated,       being    complicated by the fact that                              a

   in that of         1812, as the        following quotations will show.                     We          have
   first of all (p. 151), an alternating function                     of several variables.

Next we have an alternating function with respect to several indices

This   example        being an alternating                         function        according to the first
definition,     it would            seem that here we have a mere abbreviation or
variation     of language.                There are, however,                       it must      be borne   in
mind, functions which                     are alternating               with       respect to indices, and
are not alternating according to the first definition.                                          For   example,

alternating with respect to all or any other number of the variables

nating functions           are      made in another way to include determinants.

It  is a little     unfortunate that this definition                    proceeds     on different
lines from the others, being rather indeed a rule for the formation
of an alternating function with respect to several sets of variables
than a definition          of such        a function.          It   would have been            much
more appropriate and instructive                     to have said that a function                 was
called alternating with reject to two or more                        set*  of  the same mml>rr
of variables when the interchange of each member of a set with the
corresponding member of another set altered the function in sign
merely.        Examples         like the following           could then have           been given
to make the two usages of the term perfectly clear, and to show                                   the

In   regard to this the first comment clearly must be that                        it is not    a
little misleading.         The sums referred to are only a very special class
of those functions which                Laplace called resultants            ; they belong,
in fact,    to that peculiar type              for which in later times            the name
alternant was coined.            In the second place, Cauchy's virtual renun

proved more acceptable             in France, and that Cauchy merely bowed
to the fact     ;  but there is little or no evidence to support this.*

 Cauchy's hand.    Bearing in mind the definition given above, of
fonctions alternées        par rapport                à         diverses                  suites,    we    see    that       a
determinant of the         n"1   order could have been made to appear as an
 alternating function        with         respect          to n ranks of n variables each.

application of them to the solution of simultaneous linear equations.
Most of the matter               is   already familiar to us, and may be altogether
passed over.             One of the theorems                      it   is   necessary        to give verbatim,
not because of its importance, but because                                    it   serves to make evident
the       untenable          position         Cauchy             had taken              up in so peculiarly
bringing         determinants under the head                                 of alternating             aggregates.
The theorem             is   (p. 164)   : —
               "Si,     avec les variables comprises                          dans          le   tableau (5),      on
          forme une fonction                entiere,        du degri n, qui offre, dans chaque
          terme,      n facteurs dont un seul                              appartienne a chacune                  des

          rapport       a    ces mernes suites, la fonction                             entiere dont      il    s'agit
          devra    se   require, au signe pres,                   a    la resultante s."
This not only justifies                  the definition                    proposed         above       to be sub
stituted for Cauchy's, but                     it        also    entitles us to say that Cauchy
having started               by including           determinants among alternating func
tions of one kind, viz., functions alternating with respect                                               to every
pair of n variables, soon succeeds                               in showing that they are alter
nating         functions       of   an        entirely           different             kind, viz.,       functions
alternating with respect                 to   every pair of n ranks of variables.

                    Retrospect               op   the Period, 1813-1841.
  The characteristics of this period are best brought out by com
parison with those of the preceding period, it being carefully borne
in mind, in making the comparison, that the two                                   are markedly
unequal in length, the period of pioneering, as we may term                                        it,
extending to        1   20 years, and the next to only about 30.
  In the first       place, then,            the evidence shows that as time went on
there   was considerable increase                     of interest in the subject,           and        a
more    widely spread             knowledge of             it ;    for, whereas    to the longer
period there belong 20 papers                      by 13 writers, for the         shorter period
the corresponding numbers are 35 and 18.                               Among the 18 writers,
too, are represented              nationalities which had previously not put in
an appearance,           viz., English,           Italian, and Polish.
  In    the   second       place, we have             proof that the early period was by
far the more fruitful in original results.                          The pioneers had mapped
out most      of the prominent                     features       of the new country       ;    their
successors had consequently to concern                            themselves in   a    considerable
degree with         filling in         the    details.      During the        second    period one
finds the fundamental propositions of the first period reproduced in
new varieties of form              ;     also,     there   are     not awanting        new proofs,
extensions,    and specialisations of old theorems                        ;   but of absolutely
fresh departures there are comparatively few.                              An examination of
the results numbered                   xlv.-lviil        will show the character of            these
departures.         It    will   be seen that they are due to Desnanot, Scherk,
Schweins, Jacobi, Sylvester, and Cauchy.                              The most notable name
of the period       is   Jacobi's, and next to              it    that of Schweins.        There       is
no one name,             however, which              stands out in this period so con
spicuously     as    Cauchy'8 does in the first period.                        Sylvester, unlike
the others,    it    must be remembered,                    was only beginning          his career,
and we have yet to               see   him in the fulness of his power.
   In   the   next place, the second                     period contrasts with the first in
that during        it    important work was done on the subject of                          »]>ea'al
forms of determinants.    Here, again,                            the noteworthy        names     are
those of Jacobi and Schweins.
   Lastly,    it   having been noted in the retrospect of the first period
that the subject of determinants was almost entirely a creation of
the French intellect, we must not fail to take cognisance                               now of the

fact that in the second period the pre-eminence           belongs   to Germany,

     Of the two English mathematicians          whose   names are inseparably
 associated with the development of what has been called Modern
 Higher Algebra, Sylvester,       as we   have seen, was the first to direct
 public     attention to the functions       then partially known       as  deter
 minants,      but called by him in the heat          of supposed discovery
 "zetaic products of differences."        Cayley it was, however, who gave
 the great impetus to the study of them — an impetus due to two
 different causes, the choice of an exceedingly apt notation and the
 masterly manner in which he put the functions                to use.    How     he
 obtained his knowledge we know not.               It may be that Sylvester's
 two early papers had directed his attention to the matter, and that
 he had then read some of the authors who preceded                Cauchy   ;  but,
 whether this be true or not, it is certain that by his own                  inde
 pendent research       he had attained   in   1841 a powerful      and compre
 hensive grasp of the subject.        The little paper to which we have now
 come is ample evidence        of this.   A peculiar interest      attaches to    it
 also, as being the Erst fruits of Cayley's genius,         the earliest of that
 long and varied series of papers which has done so much to extend
 the bounds of pure mathematics.*
     With characteristic directness and concision       he opens as follows    : —
            " We
                   propose to apply the following      (new   1) theorem   to the
        solution of two problems in Analytical Geometry.
    *
      In a strictly chronological arrangement Cayley's paper would not follow,
 but precede the papers of Craufurd, Cauchy, and Jacobi of the same year.         It
 was published in February : Cauchy's note was presented to the Academy on
 8th March, and Jacobi's memoir bears the date 17th March, though not pub
 lished for more than two months afterwards.        As Cayley's first appearance,
 however, marks the beginning of a new epoch, and as the other papers referred
 to belong by their character to the preceding epoch, a slight deviation from the
 chronological order seems warranted.

    Here then we have for the first time in the notation of deter
minants the pair of upright lines             so familiar     in all    the later work.
The     introduction     of them marks an epoch              in the history, so im
portant to the mathematician is this apparently trivial matter of
notation. By means of them every determinant became represent-
able, no matter how            heterogeneous       or complicated its elements
might be; and the           most   disguised member of the family could be
exhibited in its true lineaments.            While the common characteristic of
previous notations is their ability to represent the determinant of
such a system as

analogy, — the infinitesimal calculus supplied with Lagrange's nota

or  log (1 - x)ftl    + z) would       be   in the    exact     predicament of the
theory of deteminants prior to Cayley.
    Of  less importance is the fact, which the quotation indicates, that
Cayley had discovered for himself the multiplication-theorem,                         but
characteristically hesitated to proclaim it new : also, that, probably
following Vandermonde, he took the recurrent law of formation for
his definition, making the signs all + in One case and + and                             -
alternately in the next, exactly as Vandermonde did.

what    has    just         been said above                          regarding the groat advantages                                     of

been given in forms, lengthy and forbidding,                                                      many years before by
Lagrange       and Carnot.                          What             Cayley               did was          to      rob it of all
disguise, by expressing it                           as the          vanishing                  of an elegantly formed
determinant       ;    and secondly, to                               show that the                        said        determinant
vanished because it was eight times the square* of another deter
minant whose zero character could not be overlooked.                                                                   As    has been

The conviction       that the identity ought to come out as a result of
elimination, and the ingenious fulfilment of               it by using the    identity
a + /? + y = 0 after the manner of Sylvester's paper of 1840 are very
noteworthy.
    It   is finally noticed that      "the additional equation that               exists
between the distances of five points on a sphere                  " can be similarly
obtained, and the process is given.

suffice    to note in regard to     it that the so-called inductive            method
is followed, and that two cases have to be considered,                 viz. (1) when

each     element           of one           row be diminished                   by        the corresponding
element of another row.                       No such         theorem        had been formulated or
used before his time.                                                                                           (lix.)
      Lastly,    it    may be               pointed out that we have here                                 the    first
instance        of    a      practice which                 afterwards           became          very general,
viz., putting         a    dot instead of              a    zero element             when writing          a    deter
minant.

    Hesse, at this time, must have been unaware of Richelot's           paper
(dated from the same University),       and Grunert's paper, not to speak
of writings published outside Germany, for the method which                he
gives of finding the final equation is nothing more nor less than
Sylvester's    dialytic method.      His exposition,   to say the least,    is
not preferable to Grunert's, and the determinant of the (m + n)tb
order which he prints is misleading in points of detail.

    A quite peculiar form of the law of formation of a determinant
had its origin with Grassmann.         Grassmann,   it will be remembered,
was    one   of the most distinguished of the mathematicians who
occupied themselves with the search for an Algebra of directed
quantities, or with the allied problem of the geometrical interpreta
tion of the so-called imaginary expressions of ordinary algebra.           By
the beginning of the third decade of the century, the way had
been gradually, though intermittingly,       prepared for important dis
coveries on the subject by the writings of    Wallis (1685), Buee(1805),
Argand (1806), Servois (1813), Mourey (1828), Warren (1828), and
Gauss (1831).*        With Hamilton and Grassmann important dis
coveries   came.    Hamilton, whose writings of 1833 and 1835 show
that even then he had meditated to some purpose on the matter,
announced in 1843 his great invention of Quaternions.              In 1844
Grassmann followed with the first part of the Ausdehnungslehre.

    In his  preface Grassmann explains the steps by which             he had   been
led to his theory.      First, there   was the question       of the addition     of
directed straight lines      (Strecken),     or vectors,      to  use   Hamilton's
widely accepted      term.    This it   was    unnecessary      to linger over,   as
hi3 predecessors    had already dealt satisfactorily with it.           Then   came
the question of multiplication       of vectors.       Seeing that when a and
6  represent two lines in magnitude only, in other words, are scalars
and not vectors,     the product db represents the rectangle of           which a
and   b are  adjacent sides, Grassmann ventured to denote by the pro
duct ab, when a and          b  are  vectors,   a parallelogram        having    the
vectors for adjacent sides.        This definition of multiplication mani
festly entailed the result
                                    a? =    0;
and along     with the definition of addition required further that
                                        = ab + ac
                              a(b + c)               .
These two again involved a third, viz.,
                                     ab=    -ba;
for from the two we have
                            0 = (a + &)*,
                               = (a +
                                      b)a + (a + b)b,
                               ^aP + ba + ab +     b2,
                               = ba + a b .
The remaining steps of the building up of the theory need not be
told, as these laws of outer multiplication              (" austere    Multiplica
tion ") suffice for the purpose wo have in view.
    The exposition of the theory itself is broken up into an introduc
tion and nine chapters, all of them marked by ability and much
originality.     It is the second     chapter which deals specially with
outer multiplication,    and at the end of it (pp. 70-73) occurs the
application which concerns determinants.              The matter is introduced
by   a sentence   or two pointing out that       it is  scarcely   to be expected
that outer multiplication        can   be so    directly    applied to ordinary
algebra as to geometry and dynamics, because                 in ordinary algebra
the quantities are     essentially alike (gleichartige, in the sense of the
Ausdehnungslehre), and outer multiplication               presupposes     the idea

The method is thus seen to consist in the deduction of                                                             a    new equa

columns.        Grassmann, however, makes no reference to determinants.
  In   a   paragraph of          a    subsequent chapter                             (p.   129), he takes up the
problem of elimination                    between two equations of the                                             m"1          and nu
degrees.        What       it   contains       is       a   reproduction of Sylvester's dialytic
method,     without any reference to the author of the method.

                                              A. Introduction.
     1.      In   the case        of two Vectors, a,                  /?,   the Scalars          a2, /S2, Sa/3 are
connected            by no relation.                In other words, the Tensors of two
straight lines,            and    the angle between                    them, are three                independent
quantities.            In this         case every other Scalar Function                               of a and      ft
can       be expressed           in terms of        a2, ftp, Sa/3.               Thus,
                                        Sa/?a/J=2S2a/3-a2/32.
For          convenience         we shall         call Scalars of the                     form        - a2,     Tensor
Scalars, and Scalars of the form Sa/3, Primary Scalars.
        2.   The introduction            of   a     third Vector,               y, introduces three              fresh
Scalars,          as the   Tensor of y, and its two inclinations                                 to the Vectors
a,   ft.       In this      case we have             six independent Scalars, in terms of
¦which         every other Scalar involving                          only the three Vectors can be
expressed.             Thus,      a2, /J2, y2, Sa/3, S/?y,             Sya, are independent Scalars.
All       other Scalar functions of                  a,    ft,   y, connect            themselves        with these
                                                                                                 ....
by equations.                Thus,
                                 S2a/3y             Say    ,         Sa/3   ,     a2     I

     3.      In   general,   if   we have n Vectors, we have 3(»                             -   1)   independent
 Scalars,         as each    fresh Vector introduces three fresh Scalars, namely,
 its Tensor and its inclination to any two of the other Vectors.                                                   All
 other Scalars involving the n Vectors can be expressed                                                in   terms of
 the      3(»-l)        independent Scalars.                         Now, with           n   Vectors we have
n    Tensors, and —                         Primary Scalars, making                       W-^?   *~f Scalars in

All Scalar*, it    is clear, express                       in terms of Tensors and Primary

means of equations of the form (1).
  4. In the case of n = 5 there are three relations connecting the                                            five

themselves,    of this character             ;   having given twelve of these Scalars.

the twelve must be so selected                             as not to contain ten                      which are
functions of only four vectors, and which would, therefore, be con
nected by an equation (2).
  In the case of n = 6, we have                             six Tensors and fifteen Primary
Scalars,   connected     by six independent equations.                                 So        if   fifteen     of
these, so selected      as   to be a set of fifteen independent Scalars, are
given, six equations sufficient to determine the remaining six, can
be found.
  The problem we aim at discussing                                 is,   in the    case of       six Vectors,
having     given the fifteen Primary Scalars to express                                          in terms of
them the Tensors, and other Scalars.

and, since,
              Sa/8yS8££ = Safi(         VScSyf + VfflSSy                      + V£SSye)   ;

of which (1)     is a particular case.
Also, since,
              Sa£y8,£ = Sa0yS8f£ + Say9y(8Sc£           - cS8£ + { S8c) J   .   (6)
we   see  that the expression for Sa/3y8e£ in terms of Primary Scalars
contains    6 + 3x3    = 15 terms  in all.

   Now define      as follows,

a little consideration    will show that, by permuting the Vectors, there
are   only two expressions of the form W, and that W2 is a sym
metrical function of the Vectors.         Thus, since,
                   S0y8S£c£ +   Sy3ycS/3£8    + S0y£S/?8t = 0 ;
                   Say8Sac£   + SaytSaf 8     + SayfSaSc = 0      ;
we have,
                 Sy3y8S£ffSayeSa£8      - SaySSatfS^ycS^S
                = Say£Sa8€S;8yeSy3f8     —
                                             S/?yfS/38tSaytSa£ 8     .
Calling the permutation of any two Vectors one permutation, an
odd number of permutations           changes the sign of       W    merely.   The
formula (7), (8), readily show that W2 is symmetrical.

     When       W  vanishes,   be  it observed,  equations (8) and (10) give us
     the well-known rectangular system.

  In   this expansion for W2 it is to be observed that
      U9 contains 15 terms, U0, U6, U6, each contain 60 terms,
      U7 contains 45 terms,      Ulf  U4 each contain 180 terms,
      U2 contains 90 terms, and Us, Ug 360 terms each.
Counting     the weight of each term        as  1, 2, or 4, according     to it-
coefficient, we have,
weight of + terms = 60 +     2 x  360 +   2 x 180 + 2 x 60 + 4 x    45 + 4 x 15
                     =
                        60(l  + 12 + 6 + 2 +    3+l)=1500;

                        60(6 +   3 + 4 + 12) = 1500.
The same number, as should manifestly be the            case.
   19.  If we   had expressed Ws in terms of bu Cj, e,, &c, it should
have been borne in mind that these Scalars are connected by five

easily obtained from the other five.

    20. It  can be readily shown that the expression for W2 cannot
he square rooted     so as to express   W in the form
                       2(-   l)'Sa0S/3ySy8S8«S€£S£a.
For   a single permutation        of any two letters changes      the sign of
W, while the     successive    permutations of o, /?; a, y; a, S; a, c;  a, £,
being 5   in number, do not      change  the sign of
                            SaySS/JySySSScS^a.
So the expression for W would not           change   its sign for a permuta
tion which would       change the sign of    W.
                          E. Formulm    for  Sa/3y, &c.
   These may be obtained in various ways.             Thus   we have
             SaySSacf = a2Sy8Vt£ + SaySaSVf «        +  Sa8SayVt£    ;
             SaycSa£8 = a2SyeV£8 + SaySaeV8£ +          SafSayVf  8 ;
            SoyfSaSe = a«Syf V8c + SaySa^VtS + Sa£SayV8«             ;
 whence

deals   with the diurnal, and Part     II. with the seasonal phenomena        of
meteorology.
   Diurnal Phenomena. — An examination of the              temperatures      ob
served by the      "Challenger" proves that nowhere over the              ocean
does the mean daily fluctuation of         the temperature of the surface
amount to a degree Fahrenheit, the extremes           being from about 0°-3
in high latitudes     to 0°"9 in the tropics.    Thus the  'atmosphere      over
the ocean rests on, or blows over, a surface the temperature of which
is practically uniform at all hours of the day.        This small variation
is a prime factor in meteorology, particularly in those discussions
which relate to the diurnal phenomena of atmospheric pressure and
winds.
    The    temperature of the air over the open sea shows a daily
variation of 30-2, being four times greater than that of the sea over
which it hes ; but when the " Challenger " was near land, the varia
tion  rose   still further  to 4° -4.   This larger variation in the daily
temperature of the air,     as compared    with that of the  sea, is a point of
much significance in atmospheric physics, from the light            it casts on
the relations of the atmosphere and its aqueous vapour to solar and
terrestrial radiation.
    The   phases of the elastic force of vapour over the open sea occur
at the hours of the maximum and minimum temperatures                  of the sea
and the air.      On nearing land, however, this no longer holds good           ;
but owing     to the influence of the land breeze, the time of minimum
humidity is delayed from         4 to 6 a.m., and owing    to the sea breeze
and its effects, the amount of the aqueous vapour falls to         a secondary
minimum       from noon to    2 p.m.    As  regards  the relative humidity,
the maximum occurs from midnight              to 4 a.m., and the minimum
about    2 p.m.,  this curve being thus inverse to that of the tempera
ture  ;  and it may be added,        that this is substantially the curve of
the relative humidity for all climates and seasons.
    The   phenomena     of the double diurnal barometric tide appear in
their simplest form in the        eentre of the Pacific, or    in the midst of
the largest water surface of the globe.              The following are the
variations of pressure from September 1 to 12, 1875, in mean lat.
 1° 8' S. and long. 150° 40' W., the mean pressure for the time being
29,928 inches :—

from which it is observed that the amplitude of the range from the
morning maximum to the afternoon minimum                     amounts to 0°-087
inch.
   Latitude    for latitude, the smallest variations over the open sea
occur in the anticyclonic          regions   of  the different oceans.        Thus
about lat. 36°, and the time of the year when the sun is highest                 in
the heavens, the amounts are — for the South Pacific,                0'036 inch    ;
North Pacific, 0-025 inch; South Atlantic, 0-024 inch                ; and  North
Atlantic,   0*014.     It thus appears      that these amplitudes        diminish
as  the ocean is more land-locked with continents.
   In the   open ocean     the morning       minimum      of pressure   is largest
in equatorial regions, and it diminishes           with latitude   ; but the rate
of diminution with latitude, through anticyclonic             and other regions,
is generally less, and is        more    uniform than is the case with         the
afternoon minimum.           Further,    in high latitudes over the     open sea,
the diurnal     barometric tide shows only one maximum                   and one
minimum     ; and also in continental situations in high latitudes there
occurs   in summer only       one maximum         and one minimum, bnt the
phases of their occurrence are the reverse           of each other.
   In middle and higher latitudes in           summer,    proximity to the sea,
conspicuously so when the places are situated on the west coasts                 of
continents and islands, delays the time of occurrence            of the morning
maximum       and    the afternoon        minimum    ;   whilst in continental
situations the morning maximum occurs much earlier than in lower
latitudes, and the afternoon minimum               nearly as late as at places
near the sea.    But, as seen    from the " Challenger " observations, these
peculiarities of the curves do not occur over the open sea in the
higher latitudes.      The retardation of the time of occurrence of the
morning maximum is greatest             in situations which, while strongly
insular in character,     are at the same time on, or not far from, an

extensive tract of land to eastward or south-eastward.                            A   table was
given showing, for fourteen stations, a gradual retardation of this
phase      of the diurnal       pressure    in June, from       7 a.m.     at Culloden, to
11 A.M.     at St Petersberg, and finally to           3 p.m. at     Sitka.
     As   regards the land surfaces         of the   globe, the great range hitherto
observed           between     the     morning   maximum            and     the       afternoon
minimum            is nearly two-tenths of an inch in the arid climate of
Jacobabad.           At Aden, where the climate at all               seasons is dry,        it is
0"084 inch in January,               whereas in August    it amounts         to   (H63 inch,
or nearly double that of January, when the sun occupies                                 a much
lower      place    in the sky. On the other hand, at Bombay, during the
dry   season       in January, the range is 01 19 inch, but during the wet
season     in July, though the          sun's position is then nearly vertical, the
range is only 0'067 inch.
     The    "Challenger" observations show that the                       atmosphere        over
the open sea rests on a floor or surface, subject to a diurnal range
of    temperature       so small as to render the temperature                         practically
constant both day and night, and also that the diurnal                            oscillations
of the      barometer        occur over the open       sea    equally as over the land
surfaces of the globe.               This consideration      leads to the all-important
conclusion that the diurnal oscillations of the barometer are not
caused by the heating and cooling of the earth's                          surface       by solar
and terrestrial         radiation,      and by   the effects which            follow        these
diurnal      changes in the temperature          of the surface, but are primarily
caused by the direct heating by solar radiation, and cooling by
nocturnal          radiation of the molecules of the air                  and its aqueous
vapour, and the dust particles suspended in                         it,   these       changes of
temperature being instantaneously communicated through the whole
mass       of the atmosphere,          from its lowermost stratum resting on the
surface to the extreme limit of the atmosphere.                       The all-important
bearing of these considerations of the theory of the diurnal oscilla
tions of the        barometer    was explained at length.
     The peculiarities of the diurnal barometric tides in deep valleys,
and those at high-level observatories,                 such    as   Obirgipfel         and Ben
Nevis, were described and discussed.
     During the        cruise, observations of the force              of the wind           were
made on 1202 days, at least twelve times each day, 650 of the days
being on the open seas and 552 near land.                     As    regards the open sea,

   the diurnal variation of the force of the wind                 is exceedingly small,
   the difference      between     the hour of least and greatest velocity           being
   less than a mile per hour ; and as the hours                of occurrence of       these
   very     small maxima and           minima       vary with the different        oceans,
   they cannot be regarded as true maxima and minima.
                                                                           " Challenger"
      Quite different is it with the winds observed by the
   near land, the force of the wind there giving a curve as pronouncedly
   marked as the diurnal curves of temperature,                 pressure,   or humidity.
   The minimum          occurs     from   2   to 4 a.m. and the maximum               from
   noon to 4      p.m.,  the highest velocity being at             2 P.M.    The    curves
  from each of the five great oceans give one and the same result,                     viz.,
  a curve closely         congruent with that of the diurnal                temperature.
  The differences       between      the hour of least      and greatest velocity        are
  these   : — Southern     Ocean,     6£ miles    ;  South Pacific,   4i   miles ; South
  Atlantic,    3
                 J miles ; and North Atlantic and North Pacific,              3 miles per
  hour.      Another     point of considerable importance is that in no                case
  does    the maximum velocity, attained near land about or shortly
  after noon, reach the velocity of the wind on the open                   sea.
     The diurnal        variation     in the amount of cloud             ia very small
  There are, however, indicated two maxima, one about sunrise and
  the other early in the afternoon          ;   and two minima, one at noon and
  the other from sunset          to midnight, the differences         not exceeding       6
 per cent, of the whole sky.              The observation of the diurnal occur
 rence of rain       on the open sea is inversely as the temperature,                 684
  days' observations giving 96 cases            in the   seven hours, from 9 a.m. to
  4 p.m.,    but 135 in the two hours from midnight                    to 2 a.m., these
 being respectively the times of minimum and maximum occurrence.
     Of    the   forty-five    thunderstorms         recorded,   twenty-six     occurred
 over the open       sea and    nineteen near land.          Of   those over the open
 sea   twenty -two occurred during               the ten hours from           10 p.m.    to
 8   a.m., but during        the remaining        fourteen hours of the day only
 four were recorded.            Hence, the important conclusion is arrived              at,
 that over the open         sea   thunderstorms are essentially phenomena                of
 the   night,     and occur       mostly    during      the morning        minimum      of
 temperature       and    pressure,    squalls reaching the daily maximum               at
the 6ame time        ; the phases      of the curve of distribution          during   the
twenty-four        hours being thus the reverse of what obtains over                  the

these   data    are represented        on fifty-two large maps, giving for the
months      and     the year     the distribution          over the globe of           the
temperature and pressure              of the atmosphere,          and the prevailing
winds.      These results were stated in some detail, from which the
following     broad conclusions were drawn             : — This investigation shows
in the    clearest     and most conclusive manner, that , the distribution
of the pressure         of the earth's      atmosphere is determined by the
geographical distribution          of land and water in their relations to
the varying heat received           from the sun through the months of the
year;    and     since    the relative     pressure      determines       the direction
and force      of   the    prevailing    winds,     and    these   in their turn the
temperature, moisture, rainfall,             and in       a very    great    degree    the

applicable     not only to the present state of the earth, but also to
different distributions of land and water in past times.                     In truth, it
is only by the aid of this principle that any rational attempt, based
on causes having a purely terrestrial origin, can be made in explana
tion of     those    glacial and warm geological epochs                through which
the   climates of Great Britain and other countries have                          passed.

those climatic         changes,    which necessarily result             from     different
distributions      of land and water,          especially those        changes      which
influence most powerfully the life of the globe.

 On the Stomach of the Narwhal (Monodon monocerox). By

                                  (Read   March 18, 1889.)
     Although      numerous most          admirable descriptions of the stomach
 of various species of Delphinidse (the family of toothed Whales to
 which the Narwhal belongs) have from time to time appeared from
 the pens of most          able observers (of whom a list will be found in
 the references appended), we have found it impossible to find any
 thing more than        a mere      indication   of the histological   structure of
the various portions of the walls of the peculiar digestive apparatus
 of these animals.*           As   one of us had an opportunity       of obtaining
material in a comparatively fresh condition, we decided to make
arrangements         for preserving it properly, so that         it might   be sub
jected to microscopic examination on being brought to this country.!
With all       the care     that was taken some portions           of the mucous
membrane         have   suffered     slightly, but in all cases the changes      are
so slight     that we are enabled          to speak   positively on the points to
which reference is made.
     In   the Narwhal, as        in other   cetaceans, the stomach is of a com
plex nature,        and has been compared           by some observers to that of
the ruminants.           In   the present state     of our knowledge, however,
it   is difficult     to give any definite opinion          on the morphological
affinities and relations of the viscus, though it certainly approaches
the carnivorous type much more nearly than that of the herbivorous
ruminants.          The subject is one in which great difficulties are in
volved, and although              we   think that, eventually, the histological
structure which we now give may throw some light on the matter,
we are not prepared             to say   in what group of animals the nearest
morphological structure is            found.     We now propose to describe in

is subdivided,      giving in each instance both the naked-eye               appear
ance, and,    as far as possible,        the microscopic structure,         and, in
some    cases, offering a few        observations on the more            interesting
features.
                                 The (Esophagus.
    The oesophagus terminates by expanding into a wide dilatation
constituting    a cavity      of considerable      size,   which may      be  called
   the oesophageal      paunch."      The orifice of communication is wide
and patent, having a diameter of               3  inches.    The mucous        mem
brane presents an opaque, whitish appearance,                and is thrown into
well-marked      longitudinal      folds, besides      being slightly corrugated
transversely.      Numerous       minute follicular-looking        depressions are
evident, scattered       over the surface, which,         however, must not be
looked upon as the openings of glands.
    Structure of Coats.      — 1. The outer or fibrous         coat is a layer of
tough    areolar tissue,      containing    a few bundles       of   yellow elastic
fibres.
    2. The   muscular       coat  consists of an outer thin layer of non-
striped muscular fibres running            longitudinally,    and a thick, well-
developed layer fully        Jth inch in thickness, in which the fibres           are
disposed circularly.
    3. The submucous or areolar coat is of very considerable                  thick
ness, and is formed       of somewhat       dense   connective tissue, in which
numerous well-formed vessels are seen.                Non-striped     muscle fibres
are present    under the mucous membrane,                 running    for the most
part longitudinally,      forming a layer of considerable thickness.           More
externally the connective tissue is looser           ; here and there are a few
bundles of muscle       fibres running circularly, also large blood-vessels,
both arteries and veins, the venous channels being especially large
and numerous.
    i. The mucous membrane             is remarkable for its thickness, and
for the dense and horny nature of the epithelium.                     Superficially
the cells are arranged in regular lamelke, closely resembling the cells
of the stratum corneum of the human skin, their nuclei, however,
never actually disappear as in the stratum lucidum, and there is no
space   round     those     nuclei near the free surface.           In   some cases

 small granules of pigment may be seen around the nuclei.                              More
 deeply a regular rete Malpighii obtains, the cells of which are                       poly
 hedral in shape, and have short " prickles
                                                               "
                                                                  at the margin.         The
 deepest     layer     of    the epithelium         consists of cubical        or slightly
 columnar cells (Plate            II.  fig. 1), the nuclei of which         stain deeply;
 some     appear      to   have     a single     nucleolus, surrounded         by   a   clear
 space, others      again a delicate intra-nuclear            plexus.     The   numerous
 papillae which extend the surface for the production of epithelial cells,
appear     to project upwards             as delicate filiform processes, ramifying
somewhat irregularly, as is evidenced by the great subdivision                              of
the mass      of epithelium          in the    deeper    parts.     This subdivision         is
frequently      so     marked that masses of epithelium                 seem to be cut
off from       the rest,        presenting       the   appearance      of   gland     acini,
for which,       in allied       species,    they have     by some       observers     been
mistaken.
                                Tlie (Esophageal Paunch.
   This, the dilated termination of the oesophagus, consists of                   a single
compartment, constricted               in such a manner that two cavities                are
formed, viz.,     a   main portion and an outgrowth or diverticulum endin.;
blindly.      Both these lie in the direct line of the oesophagus, and                   tbe
diverticulum       or appendage          may therefore be regarded           as its   csecal
termination.        The main cavity, which is somewhat rounded in                     form,
measures      internally       9  inches in its longest diameter by 5J               inche.-
in its shortest, whilst            the appendage        or diverticulum,       cylindrical
throughout,       is    11   inches by      4  inches.     Within the main          cavity,
some 3 inches from its oesophageal end and opening at right angles
to the line     of the oesophagus, is found the orifice leading into                      the
first true digestive cavity of the stomach.                      The diameter of this
opening is      2i   inches,     notwithstanding        the elevation of the       mucous
membrane       round its margin to be afterwards mentioned.                      Through
out the main cavity, the mucous membrane,                     as   in the  oesophagus, is
white and opaque            in   appearance,      but, at the opening leading into
the second compartment, its character changes abruptly,                        and    forms
a   ring-like    band       leading to      the summit of an elevated              fold     of
mucous      membrane,         fully   1  inch in height, which may perform,                 to
some     extent, the function            of  a  valve.    The longitudinal        folds of
mucous      membrane        already mentioned as occurring in the              oesophagus

 may be traced downwards into the cavity of the first compartment,
 where, however, their character         becomes    more    complex, and they
 preseut   a very remarkable appearance.          At first they    are elevated
 into   crests,  afterwards they are       broken up into rows of nipple
 like  processes   (fig. 1), which gradually      get lower and      converging
 towards the apical end of the appendage,            finally disappear.     They
                                     Fig.  1.
are exceedingly numerous round the orifice leading to the first true
digestive cavity, which        they may assist     in occluding, or at least
they may act in preventing the passage of large morsels                  of food
through    it
    Throughout the first compartment the mucous membrane presents
a  somewhat honeycombed appearance,            due to the presence of small
blind   depressions    which are most numerous in the nipple-like            pro
cesses mentioned.
    Structure of Coatx. — 1. The outer coat, continuous with the peri
toneum, consists of dense areolar tissue with numerous blood-vessels
and some yellow elastic      fibres.  The structure of this coat is similar
to that in the walls of the other compartments.
    2. The muscular coat consists         of two layers arranged      as  in the

wall of the oesophagus, viz., a thin outer longitudinal                                          and a thick
inner circular layer, separated                                 by loose       areolar tissue, containing
blood-vessels             and a small amount of yellow elastic tissue                            ;   this is   an
arrangement               which      obtains throughout                        the entire      stomach.        In
this compartment the longitudinal                                        fibres converge        towards        the
apical end of the appendage.*
     3.   The submucous coat is in the form of a layer of loose areolar
tissue      of considerable thickness, in the outer part of which small
masses of fat are found, and throughout which a few yellow elastic
fibres are dispersed                     Numerous blood-vessels                       are present,    and im
mediately under the mucous                            membrane the areolar tissue becomes
denser, and contains numerous muscle fibres                                           running, for the most
part, longitudinally.                 The elements of this coat are similarly arranged
in the walls of all the compartments.
     4. The mucous                 membrane            is similar in structure to that of the
oesophagus,               and consists of                   a    dense        layer    of laminated      homy
epithelium.
     A    section         through one of the nipple-like processes of this com
partment shows                  a core    of connective tissue surrounded by epithelium
(Plato I. fig. 1, and Plate II. fig.     In the centre of the core      1).
the connective tissue    loose and open, but nearer the epithelium
                                          is
it   becomes             much more dense.                        In   the core numerous bundles of
muscular tissue are seen, arranged circularly and longitudinally                                                in
the peripheral portion, circularly nearer the centre.                                       The blood-vessels
are extremely well developed,                          the larger trunks running in the centre,
the smaller at the periphery.                         The arteries, which are numerous,                   have
the ordinary structure,                    with this exception, that their walls                       are very
stout,          especially the tunica                       adventitia;          the veins have in like
manner              a   well-developed adventitious coat.                             A   complex system        of
lymphatics                is   present,    especially under the epithelium, where                          they
assume the form and arrangement                                    of    large sinuses.
      From the observations we have made, we feel convinced that                                               the
so-called               first compartment                   in no way          to be looked upon as part
                                                    is is

is a canal, between        the first and second       cavities,  3  inches long,
which opens into the second by         a projecting orifice, and the cuticular
covering of the first stomach terminates immediately beyond this
orifice, which is  2 J   inches in diameter."        This certainly    bears out
the theory that the so-called first cavity, with its lateral diverticulum,
is merely a modification of the oesophageal            tube  ; in  the  Narwhal
and in most others of the Delphinidae, at and near the extremity of
the tube, but in Home's porpoise at some little distance from the
extremity.

occupied   the   usual     position    of the submaxillary         gland.   They

out in the diverticulum, and that they may then be ejected through
 the wide opening of the oesophagus.
     A  somewhat     similar process goes on in some of the carnivorous
 birds, e.g., the owl, in which, however, the grinding              and mixing
 apparatus is below or beyond the secreting portion of the gastric
 apparatus.       We know that in birds, in which         the gizzard with its
 strong muscular wall and horny epithelium is below the secreting
 area, the food is both ground and mixed            with gastric juice, and it
 seems to be at least possible that the       same process may go on in the
 dilated and strengthened portion of the oesophagus of the Narwhal,
 the gastric juice being from time to time driven           back from the first
 true stomach.
     In connection with this question,       we may refer to Turner's paper,
 in which    he speaks    of Tyson's observations on the contents of the
 stomach     (oesophageal    pouch?) and oesophagus        of the   porpoise,   as
 bones and      other partially digested    substances.      Cleland also men
 tions the presence of perfectly clean bones in the stomach of the
 white-beaked dolphin.         One of us has on several occasions observed
 partially   digested    cuttle-fish in the mouth cavity of the recently
 killed Narwhal,       so that    the Narwhal     has at least    the power of
 vomiting     its food under certain conditions, and it is also probable
 that indigestible material may be similarly ejected.

      In the Greenland whale, Bclmna mystketus, near the extremity of the upper
 jaw, a blindly-ending depression is found on each side of the middle line
 within the cavity of the mouth, which, as Eschricht and Reinhardt suggest
  ("Recent Memoirs on the Cetacea," Memoirs of the Ray Society), probably
 represent the rudiments of Stensou's duct.

      In   most      of the stomachs          examined, the first compartment con
tained       the     less   digestible        portions        of   the

fabricii),      the horny mandibles and the crystalline lenses, the latter
sometimes several hundreds in number.                              There were also found the
dermal       skeletons       of crustaceans,          usually Pasiphae tarda (Kroyer)
and Hymourdora               glacialis (Buch.).
      Scoresby mentions               the     remains       of     fishes       as   found          in    the
oesophageal receptacle.
     The     fact that we            have     these      considerable            accumulations             of
indigestible matter in the oesophageal cavity points in the direction
we have indicated.
     Remembering the absence of any oesophageal                                  dilatation          in the
Ziphioid whales,            e.g.,   Hyperoodon, and the fact,                  as observed          by one
of us, that Hyperoodon, like the Narwhal, feeds mainly on the cuttle
fish,      Gonatus fabricii,          it    becomes      evident that this difference                      in
structure cannot be accounted                  for by any difference in the nature of
the food,       as   Turner suggests.           We should              suggest       rather,       that the
oesophageal paunch and the wide gullet are probably associated with
a    habit of bolting and storing up the food, digestion being allowed
to go on at leisure.

     The Second Compartment,                  but the First True Digestive Cavity of
the stomach,         is   cylindrical in form, measuring internally                         9   inches by
3i    inches.        At   the (esophageal          end   is   situated        the opening already
referred      to, by which this cavity communicates                             with    the previous
compartment          ;    at the distal       or pyloric         end     is   the opening leading
into the third compartment,                    a    constricted orifice which                      scarcely
admits the forefinger.               The mucous membrane                      of this compartment
has a florid and vascular appearance,                         is   soft to the touch, and                  is
thrown into irregularly convoluted folds, which have                                   a    slight tend
ency to converge            towards either end of the compartment.                           Numerous
minute follicular            depressions       are evident,            especially between                 the
ridges of mucous membrane.
     Structure       of   the Coats.       — The fibrous, muscular, and submucous
coats are as in the preceding compartment.                               The mucous membrane
is   exceedingly soft, and nearly              as   thick      as the     whole of the remain
ing portion          of the wall of the compartment (Plate                            II.   fig.    2).   It

800             Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                [i
contains elongated         tubular glands embedded in a small amount of
connective tissue, in which is a system of delicate blood-vessels and
lymphatics.         Between the tubular glands in the deeper              layer the
amount of connective tissue is very slight indeed, but near the
surface    epithelium,      where    the gland ducts proper are situated,             it
becomes more abundant.              The glands are simple unbranched tubes
arising each from a duct of its own, and running almost straight
from the epithelial         surface to the submucosa,         where   it ends in a
short hooked extremity.            The secreting portion of the walls of these
glands is formed of a double layer of cells (Plate IL fig. 2, and
Plate III. figs. 1 and 2). Internally, a layer of cells (viz., the central
cells of the gland) are for some distance down columnar in form,                   but
they become smaller in size and distinctly cubical as we come to the
deeper     part of the gland, the amount of protoplasm in each                     cell
gradually becoming smaller.              Outside this is a second layer of cells
(the parietal cells of the gland), completely investing the tubule,
and not occurring-merely at intervals as in the cardiac glands of the
stomach of the dog and human subject.               The cells are large nucleated
protoplasts, irregular in shape, slightly flattened, pyramidal,            &c, each
lodged in     a  distinct   cavity formed by a framework of delicate con
nective tissue on which small flattened             nuclei are seen (Plate         IV.
fig.  1 ).   These cells are largest in the deepest part of the mucosa                 ;
near the free surface they become smaller            in  size, more flattened, and
eventually they disappear.
     This  second compartment corresponds            with the first compartment
of the Ziphioid whales            as   described by Turner* in Mesoplodon
bidcns     and     in   Hyperoodon        rostratus, and is in the         Narwhal
somewhat larger than the first               compartment without         the diver
ticulum, though scarcely so much as one would gather from Meckel's
description.         Murie,f     on the other hand, says         that   in Globio-
cephalus the first gastric cavity is by far the largest.
     With it    commences       the   true secreting portion of the stomach,
and it may be compared to the cardiac end of the dog's stomach.
The      point    of special     interest is that     the    peripheral    cells are
specially     numerous,       forming     a layer    completely     investing      the
central or axial         columnar       epithelial  cells.     The   reticulum,     in
which the large parietal cells are embedded,              corresponds    apparently

It  appeared     in many      cases as though       the large parietal cells were
entirely surrounded by the delicate strands, but it is probable that
there is the same          arrangement here that there is in the animals
mentioned, and that there is a small orifice in the inner wall of the
space,   bringing      the   two sets of cells into direct communication.
Here and there flattened nuclei may be seen lying on the strands of
this reticulum.
                      The Second True Digestive Cavity.
    This cavity, externally concealed,          almost, between     the second and
fourth compartments, is cylindrical                in form, is curved abruptly
upon itself, through a right angle,          and measures 3 inches in length
by   1 inch in diameter.          The orifice at its proximal end has already
been referred to      in connection with the last compartment; the orifice
 at the distal end, leading into the next compartment, is also small
in  size, being less than       1  inch in diameter.      At neither   end is there
a  valve-like sphincter.          The mucous membrane,         florid and vascular
in   appearance,     is smooth and almost devoid of rugEe.                Although
small in size, this cavity is not         a  mere canal forming the means of
 communication between adjoining cavities, but must be regarded as
a  distinct   compartment, since it possesses both a proximal                 and a
distal   orifice and walls          proper to     itself, with slight     structural
peculiarities.
    Structure    of  the Walls.     — The fibrous, muscular, and         submucous
coats are arranged        as  in previous compartments, but in the areolar
tissue of the fibrous coat, which in this case is not continuous with
the peritoneum          (this compartment lying concealed between the
adjoining     portions of the stomach, and not being invested by a
serous    coat),   there    are    numerous large       ganglion nerve-cells, and
the circular fibres of the muscular coat are here especially well
developed.
    Mucous Membrane. — As in the previous compartment, the glands
are mostly simple elongated            tubules, arranged vertically to the free
surface,   though in some cases they divide.               They do not, however,
hook round at       their extremities, and from the presence in most cases
of only a single set of cells, there is       a  distinct difference in this struc
ture from those already described.               The glands of the second com

                                                                           " central "   and
  " parietal"      Of   these in this cavity,       in most cases ordinary columnar
  epithelial    secreting cells, resting on a basement                membrane of flat
  tened     nucleated cells, and corresponding to the                    "central"     cells,
 alone     are present       (Plate I.   fig.    2); but in     a few glands,     at what
 may be called the cardiac              extremity,      a few of the large         parietal
 cells are found in the deeper               part of the tube (Plate IV. fig. 2).
 The      framework        of   connective tissue supporting the glands is
 much more abundant and stronger than in the previous compart
  ment.
      It  is generally agreed that in Delphinidae this portion                      of    the
 stomach      is much narrower and more intestine-like than any                     of    the
 other compartments.              Meckel,       speaking     of   this   portion   of     the
 stomach      of the Narwhal,        describes     it as much narrower and longer,
 commencing with a small ca?cum, which lies backwards and to the
 left, first taking     a   turn forwards, then quickly backward, then again
 forward and somewhat to the right, in order to join by a very
 narrow sphincter orifice           the duodenum.           (This    can scarcely corre
 spond to the cavity above described in anything but shape.)                               In
 the     case of Globiocephalus,         Murie *      describes    it  as a communicat
 ing passage, which "leaves the second stomach on its right inferior
 wall, an inch below the wide aperture which connects the first and
 second, and      it enters the third       stomach above and behind.                There
 is no true sphincter at either end."
      Turner.t referring        to Murie's       description, says that       "in  Globio
 cephalus      melax,   both     Dr Jackson and         I   have described five com
 partments,      though Dr Murie regards the compartment which                      I have
numbered three not            as a true digestive      sac,  but only as a communi
cating canal.         With this interpretation, however, I am unable to
agree,     and still adhere to my opinion that it is a true, though
small,      gastric     compartment."             Morrison      Watson       and   Young
give their reasons            for dissenting       from     Murie's     view   briefly,    as
follows : —
     They point out that in many animals, e.g., birds, certain limited
areas of the       stomach are set apart for special glandular secretion.

Xlie      interpolation      of  a single simple communicating tube, devoid of
gastric      function, would be an anomaly                   ;   and they adduce further
argument, that for the purpose of communication                                 a mere   orifice,
similar        to   those     between the other compartments, would                        servo
equally well.
       On   these grounds, we are inclined                 to agree    with    those who con
 sider this       to be a distinct gastric compartment, in addition to which
 we might         adduce the following         : —
       The    mucous      membrane       consists      of a series of glandular            tubes
 lined       with     distinct    secreting      epithelium,        as   already     described.
  Although         there   is no regular valvular              fold of mucous        membrane
  at    either orifice,      these  orifices    will neither of them admit of the
  passage      of more        than   a single       finger,      and the circular        muscu
  lar fibres around           the constricted portions            will, in    these   positions,
  have      greater     contracting      power than            around    the      more   dilated
  portions,      and they must exert a sphincter action rather than assist
  in    producing peristaltic         movement,         more      especially     as they lie at
  each end of the dilated portions of the tract
                             The Ttiird True Digestive Cavity.
       This cavity, in certain          respects,      resembles      the   human stomach,
   being     somewhat cylindrical            and     crescentic     in form, and slightly
   curved upon itself lengthwise, with                   a   well-marked        fundus at the
   proximal end.          Internally it    measures,        while moderately distended,
   7   inches in its longest diameter by                3 inches     in its shortest.       Both
   orifices lie in its lesser curvature, the distance between them being                         3
   inches.     Of   these the first has already been noticed              ; while the second,
   leading into the fourth true gastric compartment, is slightly larger,
   being fully       1  inch in diameter.           The mucous         membrane        is raised
   into imperfectly marked folds throughout the interior of the cavity                            ;
   it  also forms a slightly        elevated     ridge at the distal orifice, but there
   is no regular valve present.
       Structure of the Walts. — The fibrous, muscular, and submucous
    coats are arranged as in the previous compartments, and the gang
    lion cells, although less numerous, are also present                         in the  areolar
   tissue    of the submucous and peritoneal coats.                     In     these situations
    there are also small collections          of lymph follicular           tissue.

distended           to   a        diameter       of     three-fourths           of    an    inch,       and
is situated          about an         inch from the distal end of the cavity,                             a
short ciecal pouch being thus formed.                                 The mucous membrane is
similar in appearance                to that of the previous               compartments, but is
smooth,           and almost devoid of                 rug£&         The pylorus is represented
by    a   well-marked elevation of the mucous membrane,                                    which, how
ever, is blunt, and rounded at its free edge.
   Structure of the Wails. — The outer coats are much the same as
in the previous compartments, but the longitudinal layer of fibres
of the muscular coat is very poorly developed,                             and, with the excep
tion of a few fibres,                 is,   in   most       parts,    absent.         Nerve ganglion
cells are present            as   in the wall of the two previous compartments.
The arteries          in the submucous                coat are numerous, and are remark
able for the thickness of their muscular, and the denseness                                    of their
adventitious, coats.
      Mucous Membrane. — The glands are very similar in their struc
ture to those of the previous compartment (Plate       fig.     the                   I.       2)   ;
lower parts of the glands frequently branch, and form transverse or
acute bendings.               Small patches of lymphoid tissue are present, and
there      are delicate bundles of muscular fibre                          lying parallel to the
axes of the glands.
      The third and fourth true digestive cavities, though separated                                    by
a   somewhat narrow opening, are very similar to one another in all

 respects.                             in both, entirely of the prin
                  The glandular epithelium              is,
 cipal or pyloric variety, and the gland tubes are alike in other
 respects.        The only valve-like structure with                    a   sphincter muscle       is
 met with at the distal end of the fourth compartment, and from this
 we conclude that at this point we have the termination of the true
 gastric function.              From this description         it   is   evident that, as Tyson
 and others assert, the first true digestive cavity corresponds in every
 way to the cardiac end of the stomach of the carnivora and man                                    ;
 whilst the following portions, with the exception,                           perhaps,    of what
 we have called the econd true digestive cavity, must be looked
 upon as essentially pyloric                   in structure, and probably                 also    in
 function.*
                                           The Duodenum.
      The arrangement of the glandular tissue in the duodenum does not
 resemble any form we have seen described, except that met with in the
 intermediate glands between the true pyloric glands and Brunner's
 glands in other animals.                    They form part of the mucosa                 proper,
 but between them                    are seen      well-developed        bands of        muscular
 and lymphoid             tissue     apparently prolonged upwards,                so that    they
 come      to be embedded             in   a  kind of submucous tissue.  The ducts
 are comparatively short,                  and are surrounded in their whole length
 by bands of non-striped muscular fibre.                        In addition      to this set of
bands of muscle,                a    well-developed      layer of muscular fibre was
observed        parallel        to   the    surface,   and at the level           of and sur
rounding        the orifices of the ducts of these glands.                      It will   at once
suggest      itself that the fibres running                   parallel to the gland tubes,
during contraction, would drive out the                         secretion,     but that those
surrounding             the mouths would constrict them regularly or inter
mittently, and so lead to                  a   temporary storing up of the duodenal
secretion.           Such   a   suggestion     is   entirely hypothetical, except in so
far   as   it   is   borne out by the arrangement of the bundles of non-
striped muscular fibre,                and by what we know of the process                         of
digestion in other animals.
   It   was unfortunate that the duodenum was cut off so short.                                  We

made a most careful search for the bile duct                    in both the wall of      the
last gastric cavity and the duodenum, but could find no trace of it                          ;
we therefore came          to the conclusion         that it must open       lower down
in the duodenum.*                Of this part of the alimentary canal                 some
6  inches attached to the stomach has been examined.                        Immediately
after the constriction            at the pylorus,         the   intestine expands to         a
diameter of        \\  inches;      the mucous        membrane       is at first thrown
into longitudinal         ridges,    which become          irregularly convoluted at         a
distance of     5   inches from the pylorus.
    The intestine measures from pylorus to anus 97 feet in an adult
animal,    so  that the length of the intestine is to that of the body                      as
7 is to 1 — about       the usual proportion in Delphinida;.                 There is no
separation     into large and small intestine.
    The structure of the wall of the duodenal portion has been already
mentioned.         In  the    intestine the muscular layers attain consider
able thickness, both the             outer longitudinal          and the inner circular
layers of the muscular coat being well                       formed, whilst the mus
cularis mucosae         is exceedingly         thick,     and is thrown        into   fold?
from which bundles of muscular tissue                      extend between the gland
follicles.
    The glands,       as   we    have     seen,    are   in   the form of bundles           of
follicles,   separated       by well-marked          septa     of fibrous tissue.        The
secreting tubes appear           to have a somewhat simple acinal arrange
ment, and present the appearance                 of modified Brunner's          glands    : —
several    tubules opening into a single duct, which                     in turn opens
on the surface.           The secreting cells lining the tubules have                    the
ordinary      appearance        of   columnar        epithelium.        The   supporting
framework        of connective tissue           is  highly cellular, and         here   and
there small masses of lymph follicular                 tissue are seen.

      Since the above      was read, Professor Sir Wm. Turner has published an
account   of the  stomach    of a full-time fcetal Narwhal (Jour, of Anal. andPhys.,
vol. xxiii. p. 486, " On the Stomach of Ziphioid and Delphinoid Whales "),
in which he states that
                               " the duodenum arose from the right and posterior
aspects of the fifth compartment.           It was somewhat dilated at its commence
ment, but soon became a cylindriform tube                        The mucous lining of the
dilated portion was smooth, that of the cylindriform tube was elevated into
valvule conniventes.         Close to where the cylindriform part of the duodenum
 began was a semilunar fold of mucous membrane, which bounded the orifice
 of the hepatico-pancreatic duct."

   ceedings during the period 1885-87.
       Dr Buchan, on presenting the prize,         made   the following    state
   ment: —
       In our Transactions for 1880 there is a noteworthy              paper   by
   Mr Buchanan on the " Compressibility of Glass."
       The methods hitherto employed for           measurement     of the com
   pressibility of solids have usually been indirect, depending for the
   most part on the determination of Young's modulus by traction,
   flexure, or acoustical processes.     This modulus is a function of the
   rigidity and   the compressibility   jointly,  so that the   rigidity had    to
   be determined independently, say, by torsional methods.             Thus the
  values of compressibility hitherto obtained have been more or less
  uncertain.
      Buchanan's process is a simple and direct one.         He measures the
  linear compression of a rod under hydrostatic pressure, and (assuming
  the material to be isotropic) obtains thus one-third of the compress
  ibility.
      His apparatus, especially the   device by which the ends of the rod
  can be microscopically examined while          it is  exposed   to very high
  pressures, is an ingenious one, and it is easy to work with ; so that
  it is to be hoped that he will soon extend his results to a large
  number of the more common solids, for our information on this
  subject is still extremely meagre and unsatisfactory.
      From the results of Mr Buchanan's experiments on "Ice and
  Brines," it is shown that the first ice formed on the sea in Arctic and
 Antarctic regions consists of pure ice, retaining, however, a large
 quantity of the residual sea-water in its interstices ; and during the
 winter this enclosed liquor solidifies in the interstices of the crystals
 to ice and cryohydrates, in so far as the temperature and the nature
 of the salts in solution permit.
      Some years previously, Dr Otto Pettersson incidentally remarked,
 in his work on the Properties of Water and Ice, that a thermo
meter immersed in a mixture of snow and sea-water, which is con
stantly stirred, indicates 28°-8, and therefore we may regard this as
the upper limit of the freezing and the nether limit of the melting
temperatures of sea-water.        Mr Buchanan's experiments confirm this
statement, and he has the merit of applying the fact that ice melts
in ordinary      sea-water   at  a temperature of from        29°-l   to  28°-8,
according to its saltness, to explain successfully the anomalous             dis
tribution of      temperature   in Antarctic     waters.    The warmer and
denser water of lower latitudes bathes           the under surfaces      of the

814             Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinburgh.               [sis.
icebergs, which in many cases are at a depth of 1500 to 1800 feet.
The temperature of the mixture at the surface of contact falls ; the
heat abstracted from the sea-water melts a portion of the iceberg,
and     a saline solution is produced, less salt, and therefore lighter
than the water not in contact with the iceberg.                  This solution,
being lighter, necessarily flows up along the sides of the iceberg to
the surface, and its place is taken by new undiluted sea-water, which
in its turn is cooled, diluted, and transferred to the surface, thus
giving a practically constant temperature of 29° -0 in the neighbour
hood of the icebergs.        The result is the production of an energetic
engine    of  circulation   and  means of cooling and equalising the tem
perature of the water within the reach of icebergs.
     Another valuable research of Mr Buchanan's deals with              " Simil
arities in the Physical Geography of the Great Oceans,"* in which he
shows that the distribution of temperature from the surface of the
 ocean downwards follows          the difference of density due to evapora
 tion and dilution of the surface water. Wherever the density of the
 surface water of the sea is high, there the deeper are high tempera
 tures found.      On the other hand, where the density on the surface
 is low, as happens, for example, near rivers, there the high tempera
 ture of the surface penetrates downward but a little way. Hence the
 important bearing of the surface waters of dry and rainy regions of
 the sea respectively on oceanic circulation.
     In the same paper are marked off, with a precision not previously
 attained, the low inshore temperature of the sea on the west of
 Africa from the Straits of Gibraltar to Cape Verde, and again from
 about Loando to the mouth of the Orange River ; on the west of
  North America, from Vancouver Island to Cape St Lucas ; and of
  South America, from the Gulf of Guayaquil to Chiloe.                     From
  Humboldt downwards these stretches of cold water have been gene
  rally attributed to the flow equatorwards of cold oceanic currents
  from Antarctic and Arctic regions.          Mr Buchanan shows, from the
  observations of navigators, the deep olive-green and often almost
  black appearance of the sea, and the abnormally low and practically
  uniformly distributed temperature of the sea through many degrees
  of latitude,   that this cannot be the true - explanation.           He then
  points out that over all these extensive sea-boards the winds blow
  from the land westwards over the ocean, with the result that the
  cold water of greater depths is raised to the surface to take the
  place of the warmer waters of the surface, which are driven far to

 westward by the prevailing winds in a manner analogous to what Dr
 Murray, in a recent communication, showed to prevail in the Scottish
lochs as the effect of winds.
    In the wide field of oceanic    research, Mr Buchanan has further
contributed    materially   to  the improvement of instruments and
 methods of observation   ;  has made original observations on currents,
temperatures,   and salinities  ; commenced     the work  of contouring
the bed of the sea off the coast of Africa; drawn attention to the
remarkable manner in which deposits are being laid down from the
mouth of the Congo for 600 miles westwards into the Atlantic; and
made valuable suggestions as to the effect of the great Atlantic
 waves which accompany the storms of north-western Europe on
the land and bottom of the sea immediately adjoining.
   In reference to fresh water lakes, he has shown, from observa
tions made in Loch Lomond and Linlithgow Loch in 1878-79, that
the opinion generally held up to that time, that the bulk of the
fresh water of a frozen lake presented a temperature of 39°2, was
erroneous.
   The Chairman presented       the Makdougall-Brisbane    Prize, for the
period 1884-86, to   Dr John Murray, for his Papers on the Drainage
Areas of Continents and Ocean Deposits, the Rainfall of the Globe
and Discharge of Rivers, the Height of the Land and Depth of the
 Ocean, and the  Distribution of Temperature in the Scottish Lochs
as affected by the  Wind.
   Professor Crum Brown made the following statement         : —
   These papers are of great geographical, meteorological, and zoolo
gical value.   By careful selection of the  most trustworthy data, well-
devised    and laborious measurements,       and judicious estimations
where certainty was unattainable, Dr Murray has arrived at closely
approximate results for the correct mean heights of the land of each
of the great divisions of the earth, and of the mean depths of the
sea in each ocean.    From these he has calculated the total volume
of solid land   above,   and the total volume of water below sea-
level.
   He  has made careful measurements       of the drainago   areas of the
world, and shown that a very large proportion of the solid debris
washed down by rivers is deposited in shallow land-locked seas,
and that comparatively little, if any, finds its way to the great
depths of the ocean which are distant from the land.        The deposits
in the depths of the ocean proceed at an excessively slow rate, and, if
we except the earbones of whales and sharks' teeth, which withstand

the powerfully     decomposing forces at these depths, they may be
restricted to the materials contributed by the ash of meteors and
the scoriae of volcanoes.
    The paper on the influence of wind on the salt and fresh-water
lochs of Scotland is highly important from a zoological and economi
cal, as well as from a meteorological, point of view.             In it Dr
Murray shows how        the wind, by producing first horizontal and then
vertical currents, influences the distribution of temperature through
the whole depths of the enclosed lochs, whether fresh or salt.             He
has further described Crustacea dredged up from the depths of onr
salt-water lochs which have a peculiar novel interest both on account
of their remarkable luminous       organs, and, as he has been the    first to
show,    on account of their being the chief food of the herring.          We
 now know what becomes of the herring when they are no longer to
 be seen or caught near the surface, — they are feeding in the depths
 of the lochs or   sea adjoining, and in all probability the extent of
 their migrations is from the depths of the sea shorewards during the
 spawning season.
     These papers form the justification of the Council's award, and
 they represent but a small part of Dr Murray's scientific work.          The
 records  of the "Challenger"     Expedition,   now so nearly finished, will
 always remain    a  proof that he is    a skilful organiser, as well as an
 able, ingenious, and successful     investigator.
     The Chairman then presented       the Makdougall-Brisbane     Prize, for
 the period 1886-88,       to  Dr Archibald Geikie, for numerous Com
 munications, especially that entitled " History of Volcanic          Action
 during the Tertiary      Period   in the British Isles," printed in the
  Society's Transactions.
     Mr B. N. Peach, in explaining the grounds of the award, said : —
     Mr Archibald Geikie, from a lifetime devoted to active study in
  the field, from the laborious manner in which he has collated
 almost everything that has been written upon the subject, and from
  his charming style as a writer, has done more than any other living
  person to spread a knowledge of geology in this country.           Besides
  his excellent official work in connection with the geological survey
  of these islands, of which he is now the Director-General, he has
  written many separate works, and has contributed numerous weighty
  original papers to various scientific societies and journals.       Among
  these contributions, some of the more important have appeared in
  the Transactions    of our Society, and for one of them — his mono
  graph   on  the   " Old lied Sandstone of Western Europe " — he

haa     already     received     the    award    of   the   Makdougall-Brisbane
medal.
    Though      their literary      grace will doubtless make many of his
writings     classics   in  the   literature  of the science, it is perhaps on
account of his original work in the study and classification of the
igneous rocks of Scotland that he will most deserve the recognition
and gratitude of geologists.              With the exception of Maclaren's
excellent detailed work among the rocks of Arthur's Seat and the
Pentland Hills, all previous writers had looked upon the volcanic
rocks of Scotland as mere eruptive mineral masses.                 Mr Geikie was
the first to treat them,          as  a whole, from a chronological point of
view    as  the records of      a   long succession of volcanic eruptions, the
relative geological       dates of which could be certainly fixed.        In 1861
he contributed to this Society a paper giving a first sketch of a
 classification of the volcanic phenomena of Scotland, which may be
said to have struck the keynote of all his subsequent                researches  in
this subject. The more detailed studies of later years have indeed
enabled him to modify some of the views there enunciated, but the
 main broad outlines remain as they were originally traced.                   Year
 by year he has filled in these outlines from a detailed study in the
 field.    He was thus enabled to add a new chapter to the volcanic
history of his native country by the discovery of the remains of
volcanoes of Permian age in the counties of Ayr and Dumfries, of
 the existence of which he was ignorant in 18G1.
     After many       years of investigation       he gave    to this  Society his
                       " Carboniferous Volcanic Rocks of         the Basin of the
 paper upon the
 Forth," which was published in our Transactions in 1879. It was
 doubtless from the exhaustive manner in which the microscopic
 structures of these rocks was there worked out that the eyes of
 Continental geologists were opened to the fact, long insisted upon
 by him, that there is really no essential difference between the pro
 ducts of Palaeozoic volcanoes and those of the present day.
     Some of Mr Geikie's earliest labours among the volcanic rocks
 were    devoted     to  the great     basaltic tracts   of the Inner Hebrides.
 They seem to have          had    a  peculiar  fascination  for him, for we find
 him returning to them again and again during more than thirty
 years.     In the midst of other researches, he has never lost sight of
 the claims of these Western Islands.               To gain further insight into
 their geological history he has made excursions to Auvergne, the
 Eifel country, Vesuvius, the Lipari Islands, and to Western America,
 and now at length, gathering up the results of this long-continued
 research, he has       presented them to the Royal Society of Edinburgh
 as  the memoir on the "History of Volcanic Activity during the Tertiary

818            Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.           [ses
 Period in Britain," which was published last year in the Transaction*.
 The most striking features of this memoir are the new views it
presents    of the grand and varied sequence of events in the pro
tracted volcanic activity of Tertiary time, and more especially the
recognition of the plateau'type of volcanic eruption in this country,
and the connection of the successive sheets of basalt that form the
 terraced hills of our Western Islands with the almost innumerable
 dykes which cross the country       as far as Yorkshire.   For this  patient
 and successful    research,  culminating in    an essay, which is probably
 the most memorable which         the author has yet written, the Council
has again awarded      him   the  Makdougall-Brisbane medaL

        Professor Madvig. Born 1804, died 1886.                              By
                                Professor Sellar.
    Professor     Johan Xicolai Madvig of Copenhagen was elected an
 Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society in the year 1878, on the
 ground of his eminence in Classical Philology.             The Council of the
 Society could not have conferred the honour on                   a   scholar more
 worthy    to receive it.     lie may, without exaggeration,        be pronounced
 the greatest      Latin  scholar   born in the present      century      ;  and his
 services   to Greek     Philology   alone would     have   made      him eminent
 among Continental        scholars,  if his contributions      to  Latin criticism
 had not put them somewhat in the shade.                 In   the    devotion of     a
 long life to the advancement        of our knowledge of the great              Greek
 and Roman writers, in the union of masculine vigour of understand
 ing with great industry, and of singular acutencss with the soundest
judgment,      he recalls    the  type  of some of the great scholars and
grammarians of the Renaissance.             The   province of Classical Philo
logy, in which he principally worked, was that of the criticism and
emendation of texts, the most difficult            of all the       tasks   which   a
classical scholar can set before himself, and one in which failure is
more    common       than success, at least than such        success     as  Madvig
obtained.      The     two authors whom he         made     especially his        own
were    Cicero and Livy       ; and his familiarity with, and insight into
the   diction of these, the two greatest        masters of     Latin     style, have
probably never been equalled in modern               times.      This familiarity
and insight       enabled   him to produce       his Latin Grammar, which
during the third quarter of this century was the standard work on
the subject    ;  and which for clearness of method, logical coherence
of thought, and simplicity        of terminology, is not      likely    soon    to be
superseded       in our higher      schools   and   universities.      Though      he
was chiefly eminent as a grammarian and verbal critic, yet                     in his

 various editions of the De Finibus of Cicero, which                    appeared in
 1839,   1869, and 1876, ho gave a masterly exposition                  of the later
 (Jreek and Roman Philosophy             ; and,  besides   various      treatises   on
 such subjects as the " Equestrian Order," " Roman Colonies," the
 " Tribuni Aerarii," &c, one of the works of his later years was on the
 Roman Constitution, Die Verfastmng             und Verwaltung de* Romitchfn
 Staates.     But,   undoubtedly,       his  especial  distinction       lay   in his
 knowledge of MSS., his discernment of their relative value, and his
 clear and sound views of the true method and limits of conjectural
 emendation.       On the subject of the causes and kinds of error found
 in ancient MSS., nothing better has been written                 than the intro
 ductory chapter to his Adversaria           Critica, published in 1871.            Of
 his emendations,      it has been well said by an English scholar that
 " for brilliancy and inevitableness " it is difficult to find a
                                                                              parallel
 to them.     This was due as much to his grasp of the right method
 of emendation, as to      a rare  union in his intellect of bold inventive
 ness and conservative sobriety        of judgment.
     He left  a great name also as a teacher.         All   the younger genera
 tion of Danish scholars is said to have been trained on his method.
 But   he was very far from being a mere            scholar and teacher.            He
 rendered    important     services   to his    country    as  a   politician,     and
 during the three years 1848-51,          which were so critical all over the
 Continent, he was       a member   of the Danish Diet,       and filled the office
 of Minister of Worship.          After retiring from that       office   he became
Inspector of the Higher           Schools.     In  1864, the year of the war
between     Denmark and Prussia and Austria, he wrote a pamphlet on
the condition of affairs.       During all his public      career he was highly
esteemed as an honest,       sensible,    moderate   politician.      He   seems to
have been a man of great geniality of nature ; and his life, though
one of continuous industry, never impaired by any                bodily    weakness
till  he became    blind within two or      three  years of his death,         was   as
far removed     as  possible from that of a pedant or recluse.
    A  short record of the more important           events of his career,         with
their dates, is subjoined.        He was born on the 7th August 1804, at
Svaneke, in the       island of Bornholm, an island in the Baltic lying
between     Denmark       and Sweden, but forming           part of the Danish
kingdom.       His father filled    some subordinate       official post, and      was
too poor to give his son a liberal           education.      The young Madrig

entered his father's office as a clerk at the age of ten, and continued
in that capacity till his father's               death, in    1816.    In later life
Madvig believed that          he had derived benefit from this early official
training   ;  and his own experience          led him to think that boys would
do better by not beginning              to  learn Latin      till they   were twelve
years old.      In   the year 1817, when he was thirteen years of age,
he was sent by some benevolent person                  who became interested         in
him    to the Stoats Gymnasium             in Frederiksborg.         He finished his
 University    course     in Copenhagen in 1825, and began his career as
a teacher     and examiner in Latin in the following                year.    In  1828,
at the age of twenty-four, he was appointed Reader                   in Latin Philo
logy, and in 1829 he was made Professor Extraordinarius                         of the
Latin Language and Literature.              In   1834 he collected and published,
under the name of Opuscula, the introductory addresses                      which he
was in the habit of delivering              to his pupils,      and a second series
followed     in   1842.      His edition of Cicero De Finibus, which first
appeared     in 1839, and the appearance of his Latin Grammar in 1841,
gained for him a European reputation as one of the foremost of
 Ciceronian     critics (" Tullianorum criticorum            princeps ") and Latin
 grammarians.        His Greek Syntax appeared               in 1846.      These two
 grammatical works were translated into German in 1844 and 1847,
and soon after from the German into English                ;  and those translations
 have passed through many editions.                 He had written       a number of
articles on the reform of higher schools between the years 1832-3,
and in 1848        he was made        Inspector     of Education.       In  the same
year he entered the         Danish Diet      as a representative for Bornholm,
and was appointed a Member of the Ministry as                    " Cultus Minister."
He   remained     in this office   till December      1851, when he returned to
the   University       as   Professor,    no longer merely of Latin, but of
Classical Philology, which gave him the opportunity of lecturing on
and emending Greek authors as well as Latin.                      At  the same time
he was appointed Inspector of Higher Schools.                    About this time     he
applied himself to what is perhaps his greatest work, his Emenda-
tiones Livianee, which         were   first given to the world in a complete
form in 1860.          Between 1861-6           he brought     out, in collaboration
with his pupil Ussing, the well-known editor of Plautus, a complete
edition of Livy.         In 1860 and again in 1869, he travelled in Italy.
 In  1871     and 1873       appeared     two volumes of Adversaria            Critica,

  vi            Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
  containing the discussion already referred to on the right method*
  of emendation, and a numher of emendations on Greek and Latin
  writers.     It is to be remarked that his almost            unerring {acuity in
  emending Greek and Latin prose fails him,             as  it often   does eminent
  Continental      scholars,  in his correction of the poets.             It  was no
  doubt the sense of their frequent failure, in attempting to restore
  the  diction     of the Latin and Greek poets, that made Niebuhr                    a
  strong advocate of the English cultivation of Latin and Greek Terse
  composition at public         schools.   In    1884,  a   third volume of        the
  Adversaria, or rather an Appendix            to the two earlier volumes, wa.-
  published,     containing the results of his later readings              of Homer,
  Herodotus,      Athenaeus,    &c.   The     Verfassung und Vencaltung            tfw
  Romischen Staates appeared in 1881-2.              He continued to take part
  in political life till  1874, when he finally retired from the represent
 ation of his native island.        But, though afflicted with blindness for
 .some  years before his death, he continued his philological activity
 till his final illness.     He died   on December 12, 1886.
 Charles Edward              Wilson, M.A., LL.D.,          late   H.M. Chief /»-
       spector    of  Schools   in Scotland.      By  William Jolly, F.G.S.,
       EM.      Inspector of Schools.
     Charles Edward Wilson was born in Old Aberdeen, on the 31st of
 August 1815.         He   received  a thorough education          in the Grammar
 School of his native city, long distinguished for the success of its
 pupils   ;  and in King's College there, entering it           as   second bursar,
 gaining a high place in classics, and leaving it with the degree of
 M.A.       To extend his scholarship and        experience,   he resided     for five
 years   in Germany, chiefly      at Frankfort-on-the-Maine,          as  tutor to   a
 family of distinction.        During his Continental stay,          he studied the
language, literature, and educational systems of Germany and France,
and made acquirements          which were of the highest utility in his after
career.      On his return to Scotland in 1845, he worked for some time
in the Free Church Education             Office,  in Edinburgh.          In 184S   he
became Classical Master in Glasgow Academy, then under the rector
ship of     Dr James Cumming, late H.M. Inspector of Schools, witl

  whom he maintained unbroken intimacy.                    In February       1852   he
 was appointed Assistant          Inspector, and for several years was asso
 ciated with   Dr Camming in         the examination of Free Church schools,
 during the days of denominational               grants from the Privy Council.
 In  1859, having been       placed in charge of the "Western              District of
 Scotland, he took up his head-quarters            in Glasgow.      His duties long
 involved constant travel over the whole of Scotland, including                    the
 Hebrides, experiences       trying     enough,    especially before the present
 extension of steamboat and railway, but interesting and instructive,
 and thoroughly enjoyed        ;   rewarded, moreover,      by uncommon oppor
 tunities of insight into the educational, social, and religious condition
 of the    people,   and by enduring          friendships.      These wanderings
inspired him also with a high appreciation of Scottish scenery, and
 made him an active pedestrian to the last.
    Under the Scotch Education Act of                  1872,   Inspection     became
national, and the whole country was divided into separate districts,
under independent officers, the late         Dr John Gordon being Inspector-
in-Chief, with residence         in Edinburgh.        After Dr Gordon's retire
ment in 1874,      Dr Wilson       succeeded    him as metropolitan Inspector,
and removed to the capital.            On leaving Glasgow,       he was presented
with   a handsome testimonial by teachers and friends, an expression
of their high    respect for him as a man and an inspector.
   In   1860,  Dr Wilson married         a daughter    of the late Dr Kobertsou,
Commissioner to Her Majesty at Balmoral                 — a union of unalloyed
happiness.      They had two sons and one daughter, the eldest, a pro
mising young officer in the army, having already served                    with dis
tinction in Egypt and India.
   As Chief Inspector, Dr Wilson had charge of the Edinburgh
District, along with several assistants.            In this capacity, he acted as
general referee in disputed and difficult cases in Scotland              ; examined
all the Scotch Normal Colleges, on which                 he yearly wrote special
elaborate reports    ;  and prepared the examination papers for the admis
sion of candidates to these colleges and for teachers' certificates.
   In religion, Dr Wilson was firmly attached to                the   Free Church,
which     he joined      on his     return   from Germany,        two years      after
the Disruption.          He  was     an elder for four       years   in Kelvinside
Free Church, Glasgow, and for twelve years in Free St George's,
 Edinburgh.       He   acted  for many years as Representative Elder for

the Presbytery of Kincardine        CNeil in   the General Assembly, which
he regularly attended,       though he took no part in the debates.
    In politics, in spite of his natural Conservative instincts, he was
a  firm and consistent Liberal, quietly interested all his life in the
progress of legislation, and regularly recording his vote for his party.
    In study,    he kept np his acquaintance with Classics, French,          and
German, setting the questions in these subjects for the Education
Department for many years.           He  was much attracted     by antiquarian
researches,     and became      a Fellow of the Antiquarian          Society   in
Edinburgh       in  1870.    Seven years later, he was elected      a Fellow of
our own Society.
    Education, however,       was naturally his chief study, and to      this  he
devoted life-long attention.        He edited for   some months an educa
tional journal issued by the Free Church shortly after the Disruption,
and   till  1852 acted as secretary to the Free Church Teachers'       Associa
tion.     He   was a    Fellow of the Educational      Institute   of Scotland
from its foundation        in 1847, though never, like Dr Cumming            and
others     of his friends, its President —an honour which his official
appointment no doubt prevented being bestowed upon him.
    As Inspector of Schools,         he  was  distinguished     by uncommon
equanimity, genuine kindliness, fair judgment, transparent honesty,
quiet but real sympathy with teachers and pupils, and remarkable
 fidelity and care in the performance        of duty.    He was everywhere
 trusted, esteemed,       and liked   in all his official relations.     To   the
 Education      Department, he was a singularly       devoted    servant, sacri
 ficing his whole time to the work, and adorning the position.                He
 richly deserved the encomium of the Privy Council in their Report
 for 1887, where they record their sense, certainly not too strongly,
 of "the serious       loss sustained by the Department,"          through    the
 death     of one    " who, during thirty-five    years, had rendered most
 faithful, efficient, and valuable assistance to the cause of education."
     In  regard    to Education, while he helped to make       it effective and
 progressive     by his annual examinations and Blue Book reports, his
 chief service was rendered in connection with the Training Colleges.
 Ix>ng    earnestly interested in endeavours to raise         the   professional
 proficiency, scholarship, and general       culture of teachers, he took      an
active part in combining the University with the Normal                   School
course,      by securing simultaneous attendance at both.              Tbia   im

portant subject      was constantly referred   to in his General Reports; and
no     one rejoiced   more than    Dr Wilson when this union        was fostered
by      the special arrangements of the Department              and the other
authorities       concerned,   and when a yearly increasing          number of
 Normal students       began to attend the  University and to take    degrees —
 thus preparing, for the conduct of both our common and higher
 schools, the best class of teachers       yet produced by the educational
 machinery      of our country, in which Scotland is still far in advance
 of England.
      In  recognition of his official standing and long services to Educa
  tion, he received,     in 1870, the honorary degree of       LL.D. from his
  own University of Aberdeen, for which           he always retained a filial
  affection, while furthering general university advance.
      Dr Wilson had no special social or intellectual ambitions. He took
  no active part in public affairs, and he has left no literary or other
  remains, beyond his numerous Blue Book reports.          These were written
  with the extraordinary       care which he bestowed on all lie did, every
  sentence    being touched and retouched         till it satisfied his     taste.
  They contain sound views and suggestions on education, and reli
  able estimates of the educational work with which he was brought
  into such close contact for more than thirty years.
      Dr Wilson continued assiduously to discharge all his official
  duties almost to the very end            He   passed   quietly   away   in his
  pleasant home in Palmerston Place here, more suddenly than, from
  his robust health, had generally been anticipated,           on the 18th of
  March     1888.    He   was  interred in the Dean Cemetery, his funeral
  being attended by a large and representative assemblage of friends,
 colleagues,    churchmen, and educationists.
     Eminently endowed with the         graces of character,    Dr Wilson     was
 emphatically the gentleman in mien, manner, and feeling, and ex
 hibited much of what is now comparatively rare, the genial courtesy,
 if not courtliness, of an older time. " In his private capacity," says
 Dr Thomas Morrison, of the Glasgow Free Church Training College,
 one of his earliest and dearest friends — and his opinion will be
 generally endorsed       by an unusually wide circle in all parts of the
              "
 country — Dr Wilson          was a man greatly beloved.         Full of varied
 information, genial and kindly in disposition and manner, simple               as
 a   little child, and retaining to      the last wonderful      freshness and

vitality,  he was held     ill the  deepest respect by    all who  had the plea
sure and privilege of his acquaintance.            A  tried and trusted friend,
a wise   and sagacious      counsellor, emphatically      a good   man,  with  no
tinge of baseness      in hie composition, he has gone to his grave in          a
ripe and honoured old age."*
       Robert Mackay Smith.                 By Professor Swan, LL.D.
    Eobert     Mackay    Smith     was born    in Glasgow in 1802, where       he
received his first schooling.        Afterwards he was sent to the Moravian
establishment at Fulnec        ;  and finally he was for some time     a student
in the University of Glasgow.            To the influences of Fulnec may       be
ascribed    the lifelong interest he entertained       for the Moravians    ; for
whose     missions in Greenland         he did not    fail to make liberal pro
vision in his last will and testament
    Entering into business with his father Peter Smith,              a merchant
in Glasgow,       he was in the habit of making journeys        in Holland and
Germany      ;   and he thereby acquired a good            knowledge    of these
countries.       About   the year 1834 he began          business on his own
account as      a  merchant and commission-agent in Leith, and always
thereafter resided in Edinburgh, where he died on 4th April 1888;
being then in his 86th year.           From 1834 to 1878, when he finally
retired, he maintained       a prosperous business chiefly with Eussia and
Germany, while still retaining his old connection with Holland and
other places.       As might     be inferred from his successful career, those
of his friends best qualified to judge bear testimony to his unre
mitting diligence and excellent business talents.             Not only did     he
 take   pleasure    in business     for its own sake,      but the element of
 personal     attachment     entering    largely into   many of his business
 relations, his energies were often prompted by the desire to promote
 iuterests   other than his own.
    But while thus       occupied,    Mr Smith never failed      to improve all
 available intervals of leisure in cultivating his literary and scientific
 tastes.    In 1847     he became      a life-member    of the British Associa-

tion ;     and, so long as strength permitted, he was                 a   faithful attender
on its      meetings,     from which he was rarely or never absent.
      ¦Geology      was   to him a subject of special interest;                 and, about
1857-8, when Iceland                was    much less       readily accessible         than it
now        is,   he more than once visited that remarkable country.                       These
 visits     to     Iceland were doubtless the outcome               of    a   genuine love
 of     geological observation      ;   and from that         point       of view,    to    his
 Icelandic        experiences             with special delight. But
                                 he always recurred
 this feeling was enhanced by other considerations of the kindliest
 personal character.  While in Iceland, as was his wont, he had not
 failed to make many friends, with whom to the last he maintained
 alively correspondence and intercourse. He used to furnish them
 with newspapers, periodicals, and scientific journals and,  said,        ;      it   is
 he kept open house for Icelanders who might visit Edinburgh.
   It was through Mr Smith's                  influence that the stations at Reyk
 javik and Stykkisholm were                  obtained for meteorological observa
 tions in connection with the Meteorological                      Society of Scotland.
 Among the various scientific associations                   with which he was             con
 nected      there was none        in which       he took    a   livelier interest    ;    and,
 as   a   member       of its Council, he devoted much time and attention to
 its affairs.       To this     effect, the writer   is   indebted to      Mr Buchan, its
 Secretary, for the following testimony: —
   " At the time of his death Mr R. M. Smith had for twenty-three
 years     been     a   member     of   Council     of the Scottish Meteorological
 Society, and in that capacity had rendered most energetic and effective
 service to the Society  in many ways and on many occasions.    He took
 a   strong personal interest in the extension of the Society's member
 ship and sphere of operations.               About the time when             he became      a
 member of Council, the Medico-Climatological                    Committee was formed;
 and,     in establishing     the stations     in connection with the Committee,
 he gave invaluable           assistance     in securing for the Society the              more
 important stations in Iceland, Faro, on the Mediterranean, and in
 South America.            From the first, he         was one of the most liberal
 subscribers publicly and privately to its foundation and maintenance;
 and he bequeathed            to its funds   a   legacy of   £500."
      Among other Scientific            and Literary Associations, of which                Mr
 Smith was         a    member, may be named              the Antiquarian       Society of
 Scotland, and the Royal Scottish Society of Arts.

xii            Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
    Of  the   Royal Society of Scotland           he became a Fellow in 1855;
and latterly might be reckoned as among its oldest members.                      For,
as appears     from the lists of Fellows at November 1887 and                1888, at
the time of his death        Mr Smith must have stood in order of           seniority
between      31st and 28th, out of a membership of about 470.                    This
fact may be regarded           as not unworthy of record,       as illustrating the
rapid change to which, at the hands of time, such a body                       as the
Royal Society of Edinburgh is subject.                Although Mr Smith         never
contributed in authorship to the Transactions of our Society, he                  was
one of its most loyal members,           who always took the deepest interest
in its welfare      ;  and who, by his reversionary legacy of £1000 to its
funds, may be numbered among                  its most munificent benefactors.
Our Librarian,         Mr Gordon,     bears  testimony that
                                                                " in his later days,
when no         longer able      to attend its evening meetings,          Mr Smith
rarely     allowed      a day to pass       without   an afternoon visit to the
Society's Rooms."
    Mr Smith        was appointed a member of the Board of               Visitors of
the Royal Observatory of            Edinburgh about      1855.     He continued to
hold that post during the remainder of his days                ; and, as    Professor
Piazzi Smyth has          written, " for  so long attended,     whatever meetings
were held, more           regularly than any other member."              He always
took   a  lively interest in the welfare of the Observatory, and in many
ways sought to promote its usefulness.               Entirely   at his own cost, he
erected an electrically controlled clock in the            Edinburgh University
 Buildings, and also two other clocks, similarly electrically controlled
 from the Observatory, at the entrances                of the Leith Docks.         The
 dropping of the Observatory Time-Ball on the Calton                      Hill   being
 too often invisible        at  Leith owing     to the smoke      of the   city or    to
 fogs,  Mr Smith's        purpose in erecting these clocks was the better to
 enable shipmasters to obtain the rates              and errors    of their chrono
 meters ; and       it is just  cause for regret that, for want of co-operation
 in the shape of needed supervision and care-taking, his reasonable
 expectations ultimately failed to be realised.
     Throughout his long life an earnest supporter of schemes devoted
  to the welfare of his fellow-creatures,           Mr Smith      gave   liberally    to
  the Royal       Infirmary     of Edinburgh,      the   Children's    Hospital,    the
  Dairy Girl's Reformatory,          and other benevolent institutions.          With
  a wholesome         contempt for mere conventional almsgiving, he never

                                   Obituary Notices.                                 xiii
shrank from any obloquy which might be incurred by saying no to
applicants for schemes regarding whose utility he was not satisfied
— wisely      husbanding        his means       for the unostentatious         relief of
real want.        It will    serve well to illustrate       his ways and principles
of giving,    if  reference here be made to a bequest of £500, which he
left in charge of his friend             Mr Thomas Davidson, who writes : —
" Mr Smith         used often to give me sums              of money     to expend on
material comforts,        or more       correctly, essentials     for poor children       ;
and used to listen with evident interest to my stories                      about their
quick     impulsive gratitude and their unconscious                   humour      in   its
expression.        I am   sure,   if  we knew     it fully,   there were many other
ways by which lie gave charity, for it was his habit not to boast
 about it to        any    one    else.   That     special   legacy,   however, is       a
 concrete example        of what was,       I believe, a mood habitual to him, in
 his last years at any rate, and will help to complete the picture of
 the man to those who did not know his inner life.                        The terms of
 the legacy were (after some words of kindness about myself which
 I  shall not soon forget) ' for the poor children of the streets of Edin
 burgh,    to be spent    by him      as he   thinks best for their good.' "
     Among associations         for the intellectual improvement of his fellow-
 townsmen,       the Philosophical         Institution of Edinburgh          received     a
 very large      share    of his time and energies.             Elected in 1851,       he
 continued on the Board of its Directors until the day of his death;
 and even in the very last year of his life he greatly interested                    him
 self in the formation of         a  Reference Library for the use of the lady
 members,      to which he presented            many valuable books of reference
 and of general literature.
     Towards      the   erection of the          new Medical        Buildings    of the
  University     of Edinburgh        he afforded      material help     ;  and he pre
 sented     £2000      for the foundation          of bursaries,     one    in Natural
  Philosophy, and one in Chemistry, to be held in the Universities of
  Edinburgh and Glasgow alternately.
     Mr Smith       never married.        His   eldest sister   had kept house with
 him throughout his residence in Edinburgh                    ; and, on    the death     of
  his father, his mother Euphemia Mackay came also to live with him.
  Mrs Smith, to the end of her long life, retained her faculties in                       a
  wonderful      measure     ; and    her memory       for dates, names, and con
  nections remained         to the last apparently unimpaired.               She was      a

  xiv            Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
  native of Sutherlandshire, related to the Mackays of Bighouse                  ; and
  she    could    trace   her descent     from Donald,      first Lord Rear, an
  ancestor     whose exploits she was fond of relating.            With     the ladies
  of the Reay family, until the final extinction of its Scottish branch,
  she kept up a friendship          and correspondence.          At length, about
  1878, she died at the great age of ninety -six, and was            in a   few years
  followed by her daughter.
     In his     house, 4    Bellevue Crescent, for the best          part of forty
  years,  Mr Smith had       been  in  the habit of receiving and entertaining
  his friends, with a kindness which many yet living must remember,
 and     still   more   who have      passed    away had experienced.               Bat
  although now so far advanced in years, and no longer supported
  by the companionship            and help     of   his  kind and        able sister
  Euphemia,       Mr Smith's hospitable dispositions            maintained        their
  supremacy      to the end.      In illustration of this notable trait of his
 character,     and not less of the esprit de corps which he always so
 strongly manifested for the literary or scientific associations with
 which he was connected,          the writer of this notice desires to record
  that when in 1882, although non-resident in Edinburgh,                      he had
  accepted the Presidentship        of the Royal      Scottish Society of Arts,
 Mr Smith,                                              "
                 so soon as he learned this, said — There is your room,              it
 shall be ready for you whenever you come to attend the meetings
 of the Society, and you will live             with   me."    Thus in its latest
 days an old friendship became more than ever intimate                 ;  and, for a
 period of nearly three years, the writer had frequent opportunities
 of becoming better acquainted with the many good qualities which
 distinguished Mr Smith.           Very notable was the youthful freshness
 of his mind.         His childhood had       been   spent in Hope Park near
 Glasgow, then       a pleasant   suburban residence, where,        as   he used to
 say, pears and apples       ripened the like of which were no longer to
 be found, but which has now entirely disappeared                before    the over
whelming flood of town and railway extension.                 His  love of nature,
thus early acquired,         he retained even      in advanced old        age  :  that
 " Eye                         "
          among the     blind    for beholding beauty in landscapes           and in
flowers,   and that well-marked trait of sympathetic natures, fondness
for   animals,      keen observation       of   their personal     qualities,      and
hearty enjoyment of their amusing ways.                 To this last his strong
sense of humour doubtless contributed                No one more enjoyed a

good story     ;  and his quiet but genuinely hearty laugh his friends
must well remember.
    Mr Smith       was an ardent lover of works         of art, more especially
of pictures,     which he collected with discrimination.            Not     a few of
these he gave away to friends, and some           of the more important he
presented     to the National     Gallery of Scotland.        From 1865 to the
time of his death he was a member of the Committee of Manage
ment of the Eoyal Association          for the Promotion of the Fine Arts
in Scotland      ; and Mr H. W. Cornillon, its Secretary,           testifies  to the
 excellent services     which he rendered in that capacity;                and that,
 while never forgetful of the interests of the Association or of its
 contributors,     Mr Smith   was unremitting       in his exertions in behalf
 of young artists of merit by directing the attention of the Com
 mittee to their works.
    It has elsewhere     been justly remarked regarding Mr Smith, that
 "no    one took up more        firmly and persistently a cause which he
 believed to be     sound and right."      Of this, his painstaking exertions
 in conjunction with his friend Lieutenant-General Sir James E.
 Alexander, C.B., in calling the attention of Government to the
 Defences of the Harbours of Scotland, and which                 may be regarded
 as  having borne fruit in the erection of the fortifications               on Inch-
 keith and Kinghorn Ness, may serve              as   an   instance.       Thus   too,
 when, as must indeed be admitted, he sometimes                took very decided
 and it may be peculiar views, in which his friends were unable to
 agree with him, he nevertheless was wont to adhere to them with
 characteristic determination.
     But   those who knew him best        could never doubt the sincerity of
 his convictions, nor, in the occasional manifestations of the severer
  aspect   of his character,   could they lose sight of its essential good
  ness, or forget its habitual geniality.      Thus     also   it proved that, in
 spite of his characteristic peculiarities,     Mr Smith's       name deservedly
 acquired and to the end maintained in commercial circles the highest
  respect.
     In his day he was Chairman of the Chamber of               Commerce,       and a
  Director    of the Commercial Bank of Scotland.                 Although      never
  appearing prominently as a citizen of Edinburgh,                 his means and
  opportunities     were for him     continually a
                                                      " talent well employed,"
  whose influence for good may not soon be forgotten.

 The late Robert Gray, Vice-President.                   By R. H. Traquair,
                                  M.D., F.R.S.
    The brotherhood of science includes the amateur               as  well as  the
 professional, and the amateur        who devotes      what energy and time
 he can snatch from a laborious business career           to the furtherance     of
 human knowledge,         whether    by original    research,    by aiding     the
 researches of others,     or by keeping up an interest in science among
 his friends and fellow-citizens, is worthy of being held in affectionate
 remembrance,      even   by those who are able to devote            their entire
 time and their whole minds to scientific work.              And at   a time  too,
 when so many litterateurs boldly and ignorantly express their abhor
 rence of the entire subject of Biological       Science,    our sympathies are
 especially enlisted in favour of those who, not as so-called             popular
 writers, but   as steady  and devoted workers, add their own portion to
 our knowledge of particular         branches, and also by their example,
 their conversation, and their friendship          diffuse a liking for      such
 studies in the minds of others.
    An amateur in      the best sense of the word was Robert           Gray, the
subject of the present        short memoir.      He   was born at     Dunbar in
 1825,   the son of Archibald Gray, merchant in that place, and                   a
 man   of considerable literary   tastes, but to whom      it was not permitted
to have     any great share in the direction of his son's career, as he
died when the latter was only eight years of           age.    Two years after
wards his mother followed.
    It  was also at Dunbar that young Gray received his school educa
tion, and his master,     Mr Lyon,     is known to have entertained a        high
respect for the promising abilities of his pupil.
    His   career as a man of business may very briefly be sketched.
At    the age of fourteen he entered the        branch of the British Linen
Company Bank at Dunbar, in which he served as apprentice for four
years.     He  then, at the age    of eighteen, entered the service of the
City of Glasgow Bank, and two              years afterwards left Dunbar,        on
obtaining     an  appointment     at the head-office     of the same bank in
Glasgow.
    In Glasgow    he served successively in his bank as secretary's        clerk,
teller, and inspector of branches, finally becoming agent at the St

                                   Obituary      Notices.                             xvii
 Vincent Street Branch,          where he remained          until, in March 1874, he
 removed to Edinburgh           to take up the office of Inspector of Branches
 in the Bank of Scotland.              Eight    years    afterwards he received        his
 last promotion, namely, to the office of cashier in the same bank, for
 only  five years afterwards, in 1887, the post was again vacant through
 his lamented death.          The steadiness of his promotion, and the popu
 larity and   respect    in which    he was always held both by his superiors
 and inferiors in official rank, are ample evidence that, notwithstand
 ing his other    tastes, Robert Gray was not slothful               in business.
    Mr Gray formed          no exception to the rule, that a taste for natural
 history   usually     displays     itself   at   an    early   age.     As a boy      he
 commenced       to form a collection        of natural history specimens,           and,
as is also usually the case, his first studies were not confined to any
particular speciality, but commencing with birds' eggs, he went on
to birds' skins, which he taught himself to prepare, and soon                    he, also
included     fishes,   shells,   en stacea,     and    insects,   in the attic which
served him      as a museum.         We    have also the usual complaints about
his bringing "stinking           beasts"    into the house, made by the lady-
housekeeper,      who managed the domestic affairs of the family after
the early death of his parents.
    Gradually,     however, his attention became concentrated                    on   the
subject    of ornithology,        and by his appointment               to  the  post   of
inspector of branches of the City of Glasgow Bank, his opportunities
for study in this direction             were    much increased.           Ho had now
frequent opportunities         of travelling, especially in the western parts
of Scotland,     and    the method which           he systematically        pursued on
those journeys        was, first, of course, to settle his business            with the
agent of the branch in the place                  he    was   visiting,   and then to
inquire whether there was any bird-stuffer in the place, or any other
person    who was interested in the study of birds.                    In this  way he
gained many ornithological friends throughout the country, acquired
many specimens          of birds, filled many        a   note-book with notes and
sketches ; and to those journeys              the work by which            Mr Cray      is
best known      — tho Birds of        the   West    of Scotland — owes its origin.
This delightful      book, published in 1871, is now long out of print, and
copies at present      fetch five or six times the original published price.
   During the       last   few years of his life         Mr Gray      was engaged, in
conjunction with his friend Mr William Evans, in collecting material

xviii        Proceedings   of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
for a companion book on the      Birth of   the  East of Scotland.           The ap
pearance    of this work  has been eagerly looked forward to              by British
ornithologists, and all   will  be glad to know that          Mr Evans intends
to complete and to publish it with as little farther delay as possible.
    Mr Gray was one of a small number of friends of congenial tastes,
who in 1851 founded the Natural History Society of Glasgow,                            a
Society of which he became secretary about the year 1860.                      Under
his guiding influence, the Society increased in numbers and              prosperity,
and he himself contributed many papers            to  its Proceedings, but on
his taking up the post of agent of the St Vincent Street Branch                      of
his bank, he felt constrained to resign the secretaryship, as                 incom
patible with the duties of his new office.
    Two   years afterwards, on his removal to Edinburgh,                 he   entered
on a new sphere       of usefulness in connection with Society                 work.
 Having joined both the Royal and the Royal Physical Societies                     of
 Edinburgh, he soon was elected first        a  Councillor       and then a     Yice-
 President    in this, the former Society,       and    the    interest which      he
 took in the entire work of the Society,         as  well   as    his success as a
 chairman at the evening meetings,       are   in the  remembrance          of us all.
 But it is more especially with regard to the Royal               Physical Society
 that his influence for good made itself felt.             This old Society, —
 the   oldest scientific society in Edinburgh          with the exception of
 the Royal     Medical, — in   whose   meetings     men   like Fleming, Hugh
 Miller, Goodsir, and Wyville-Thomson            had taken        an active part, a
 Society with which was incorporated the celebrated                Wemerian, and
 whose special function in the encouragement          of scientific work cannot
 fail to be recognised, had fallen into one of its periodic fits of depres
 sion.    In  1877 the secretaryship became vacant,          and fortunately for
 the   Society and its work in Edinburgh,          there was now no official
 objection to his undertaking the work.           Accordingly        he was elected
 secretary,  to the inexpressible satisfaction of all those who wished
 the Society well, and,      in fact,  the effect upon its prosperity             was
 magical.     He speedily    gathered   around him        a knot        of energetic
 friends determined to raise the Society again to its proper position,
  new rules were drafted,       passed,   and    put in force,        the meetings
  became more largely attended,      papers of a higher class than formerly
  came in, and    every year saw the publication          of    a  still handsomer
  fasciculus of Proceedings,

      This   infusion    of new life into the Royal             Physical    Society was
entirely     due to    Mr Gray, and        affords    admirable illustration     of some
of    those personal qualities which distinguished him                 as an  individual.
!No doubt       he could have         effected   little by himself, without       the aid
of     those friends      who zealously worked with              him, but they were
 drawn     together by his personality, in which seemed to be concentrated
 the qualities desirable in          the secretary     of a  Society of the kind.
      For   he was,    in  the first place, a good         man   of business, and the
 Royal Physical Society was at the time sorely in need of such a one
 to guide it through its troubles, financial and otherwise. Then he
  was not only eminent in one branch of natural history which he
  had adopted       as   a  speciality, but his general scientific sympathies
  were extensive.         But it   was more      especially his human sympathies
  which gained for him          the   willing co-operation of       the older members
  of the Society, and excited the interest of the younger, for the love
  and respect       which     he diffused      around him       acted    as a powerful
  incentive     to others     towards aiding him in furthering               the objects
  which he had at heart.              Mr Gray      was   one of those very few men
  who are loved by all who know them.                    It unfortunately falls     to the
   lot of  most    people    to know that though they may have on the one
  side those who look          on them with         sympathy and approbation, yet
   on the other stand those who regard                  them   with jealousy and dis
  like.    But Mr Gray's warm and open-hearted geniality, his sterling
   integrity of purpose, his equable            temper,     and his gentle affability,
  disarmed     the  hostility of    those who might have been opposed to him,
   and left him, as a friend of mine lias remarked — " a man                  with many
   friends and no enemies."
       And if Mr Gray's personal             qualities attracted towards him the
  love and admiration of those who knew                   him, so also did he return
   the affection     of his friends with overflowing             interest.     He   was   a
   genuine    Lowland Scotsman in his faithful and true-hearted                    nature,
   and his amiable tendency was               rather to magnify the virtues            and
    deserts of his friends, than to criticise or            think lightly of them for
   their faults and their failings.
       During the last five years of his life              Mr Gray had       one or two
    severe attacks of illness, and his relatives and friends began to observe
    with sorrow and concern that his bodily health was no longer what
    it had been    in earlier days.         Nevertheless, on the very morning of

xx              Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
the    day on which         the   fatal blow       descended,      he    seemed    to   the
members       of his family to be in better spirits than usual.                    On the
16th February 1887, he was found unconscious                          in   an  apartment
of his house used by one of his daughters                  as a   studio for painting,
and on the morning of the             1 8th he breathed his last, and so passed
from amongst us one whose                  place  in the scientific circles of our
city, and in the affections of all who knew him, may never again
be filled.
         Asa Gray.         Born 1810, died 1888.                  By Professor
                               Frederick O. Bower.
    It   rarely happens that the death            of  a  prominent        man leaves    the
world with an unanimous opinion                 as to  his merits      :  yet such  would
seem to be the case on the death of Asa Gray ; the familiar stricture
 " de mortuis      nil nisi bonum "                                                 for  all
                                          appears to be here unnecessary,
agree in according to him the highest position, not only as a scientist,
but also     as a man.      It  was the good fortune of many men of science
in this country to have been acquainted with him, and that especially
at the time of his last         visit   to Europe in 1887       :   none    could fail to
be struck       with his combined geniality             and simplicity of manner,
while those who knew his work recognised that the placid surface
covered      the greatest    depths of intellect.
    He     was born in 1810, of a family settled              in Sauquoit Valley in
the far west, and devoted to rural               rather than intellectual pursuits.
His     father,  soon recognising the           bent of his son's mind, gave him
such      opportunity    of schooling        as  the country afforded, and subse
quently young Gray entered on the study of medicine.                           Though he
graduated       as  doctor,   he never practised, but following               his natural
 inclination     for purely scientific work,           which had already declared
itself, he became in 1831 instructor               in Chemistry, Mineralogy, and
 Botany, and performed such              duties in various colleges and schools.
 In  1833 his appointment as assistant                to Professor        Torrey, in Xew
 York, marked        an important era        in his  progress.      His interest was at
 first chiefly mineralogical, and it was in this subject that he first
 appeared as a writer ; but during his period of work                    with Torrey, his
 attention was diverted more exclusively to botany, while the literary
 influences which then surrounded him may be recognised as con
 ducing to that excellence of style which subsequently distinguished

him as     a   writer.      In    1838    he accepted              the chair         of Botany in            the
University of Michigan,                  with    the    stipulation            that he should                 be
allowed first to spend one year abroad                         :    this led to the first of his
European        journeys,         of which the last is so fresh in the memory
of many,        having        been     made      in    1887,        and completed only                      four
months before his death.                   On his return to America                       after his first
journey        to Europe he never actually lectured at Michigan,                                       but was
appointed to the chair of Natural History in Harvard College, and
went into residence               in Cambridge in                  1842.       Here he lived and
died, exercising for a period of forty-six                             years     an almost creative
influence upon American                   botany.        It        is true others had worked
before,    but it was chiefly owing to Gray that a common understand
ing was thoroughly established                   between           the systematists of Europe
and those of America.                  During his tenure of                 office the exploration
of the flora of North America was pushed rapidly forward                                           :   not only
did   he receive          and work up the collections of others,                               but he also
travelled and collected himself.                       His private herbarium gradually
grew      till in     1864,      he    offered   it,   together with his library, to the
College, on condition that              it   should be placed in               a   suitable building           :
this condition was fulfilled, and his herbarium of 200,000 specimens,
and his library of about 2200 works, then became the foundation
of what        is   now the most representative botanical                                 institution          of
America.         To   have brought together and arranged such an herbarium,
and to have organised              a   botanic garden, would have been                         a       sufficient
occupation          for    most       men;    but      Dr Gray             was       also      engaged         in
constant lecturing up to 1872, and in producing such                                           a   volume of
literary work as few could equal                        As    the result of his teaching, lie
has   left behind him             a    whole generation of capable                        botanists, who
not only follow in his special line, but have differentiated in their
branches of study, so that the whole area of the science                                       is      now fitly
represented in his University of Harvard.                                  Those who knew him
personally can well imagine how firm                               a   hold his winning manner
and ready sympathy would take upon the mind's of his students,
and this       is   one of the first elements of success                           in teaching.              But
not    only are the wide interests of                        Dr Gray to              be traced            in the
fact that he left behind him among his pupils men who followed
other lines in the science than his own specialty                                ;   it   is   patent from
his writings, and those who look over the comprehensive list of his

published works will feel that though                             his greatest             contributions
were to geographical distribution,                     classification, and morphology, he
was no mere          specialist in these              lines.      He was           one of those           ¦who
quickly pick up               the   spirit of the time in which they                        lire ;   in     no
matter was this more conspicuous than in his view of the                                     Darwinian
theory, when         it   was first brought forward.                  He took it up         at once,      and
                                                         subject,
was one of its first prominent adherents: his essays on the
now collected in the volume entitled Danciniana, will perhaps be
his work best known                  to the general public               :   written       by one     who
professes      to be       an acceptor of " the                  creed       commonly called              the
Xicene," they will go far to resolve those religious difficulties                                    which
have obstructed the progress of Darwinism.                                   At the   same time,       the
main     points of the theory of evolution                        are stated          in   these     essays
with     a precision          and appreciation            too     often wanting              in articles
designed       for    the general public,                 while       fresh illustrations             were
supplied from the rich stores of facts at the disposal of their author.
Doubtless he himself will have regarded                               these     contributions         as    a
bye-play in the main work of his life, which was to produce                                                a
" Synoptical Flora " of North America : after thirty-five years                                            of
preparation for this great undertaking, the first part was issued                                          in
187S, the second              in    1881   :    he did not live          to complete          it,   though
the     work was left in such                  a   position that       it    can be taken up           and
finished by others.                 His influence       as   a   teacher upon the botany                   of
his time was extended beyond his own lecture theatre                                       by means of
his tert-books;           his Elements of Botany                 appeared        as early as 1836,
and this book formed the foundation                          of his Botanical Text-Book of
1842, which          ran through numerous editions.                           In    accordance        with
the progress     of the time, this work has outgrown its original                                    form,
and in    iU   latest editions was planned to consist of four volumes                                 ;    of
these that on morphology was by Gray.                            It   is

in this country to require any description                                          in itself

sufficient evidence of the author's didactic power.
   It   would be impossible here to do more than mention the most
important of Gray's writings.                       Through      a    period of over fifty years
his prolific mind was continually producing fresh work, original mono
graphs,     text-books, works on classification and distribution, reviews,
obituary notices          :     the very list of them                 covers over forty closely
printed pages.            He lived        a    strenuous, active life, inspiring                with his

own energy and thoroughness those with whom he came in contact.
He almost died in         harness,  after an illness of only short duration       ;
he had,      however, the satisfaction of knowing            that his work   was
appreciated by the men of his time, for on his last visit to Europe
the highest academic         honours were showered upon him, as a due
recognition of the services of America's greatest botanist.
    Dr Samuel Drew.              By    Arthur Jackson,         Esq., M.R.C.S.
    Dr Samuel Drew of Chapeltown, near Sheffield,                was an excellent
type of a body of men, who in the past have done good work for
the    couatry, but       who are now,       we grieve      to say, rapidly   dis
appearing.       The well-educated practitioner         in the country, who is
over    ready to take up with new ideas             and with fresh modes of
thought, who perseveres          to the end of his     life with his education,
has had great opportunities of conferring benefits upon those around
him beyond the ordinary work of his profession, and has in the past
 wielded an influence in his district, second only to the vicar of the
 parish.     Such was the position occupied by        Dr Drew in Chapeltown.
     Educated in Edinburgh and Paris, his clear intellect enabled             him
 at once to perceive       the advantages     of being a student in those far-
 famed centres        of education   ;  and there he laid the foundation        of
 his knowledge of medicine and science, which added to the happi
 ness of his      life in after years, and which was of such advantage
 to his neighbours.
     He took     the    customary degrees in Edinburgh and London               in
  1852 ; proceeding to take the         M.D. of Aberdeen in 1859;       the B.Sc.
 and D.Sc. of Edinburgh            in 1875 and 1877       ;  and the Cambridge

     He   was a conscientious and able          practitioner,    commanding the
 respect    and confidence of his patients without having recourso              to
 those artificial aids which       are so common     at the present time.      He
 identified himself with the public work in his district, enjoying in
 his spare moments his well-chosen library, and contributing to the
  pleasure    and benefit of his fellow medical men in Sheffield, by the
 part he took in the meetings           of the Medical Society, of which he
 was   in 1878-9 the President.

         William Dickson.           By  Josiah Livingston,            Esq.
   William Dickson       was born in    Edinburgh in       1817, being    the son
of  a very much respected merchant.
   After going through with distinction            the High School and          the
Arts    course   at the University,     he was      offered   a  position in the
Commercial Bank         of Scotland,    where    he acquired much        business
experience,     and gained     the  respect   and esteem        of those in     the
management      — one of the juniors in the establishment being Sir
William Fettes Douglas, P.R.S.A.
    Mr Dickson found it his duty, after          several    years' service  in the
Bank, to come to the assistance of his father in the extensive paper
business which he carried on, ami, along with his younger brother
David, he joined       the firm, of James     Dickson      & Co., in which the
talents and energies of the two brothers were eminently successful.
    Diligence     in  business    did not, however, prevent him from
engaging in other studies, and he showed by his works in oil and
water colours that his pencil wanted only practice to place him                in a
 high position among artists.
    In   1852    Mr Dickson      made    a  lengthened tour in          Syria  and
 Palestine, districts    then comparatively unknown, and on his return
 his   descriptive    lectures were      eagerly    sought, and       gave    much
 instruction    and profit and delight to many and crowded audiences
 throughout      Scotland.     He    brought     from     his   journeyings     the
 materials for the formation of a museum descriptive of the Holy
 Land, its products, and the manners and customs                  of the inhabit
 ants, which collection is of very considerable value, illustrating            in a
 most attractive manner the       Holy Scriptures.
    Mr Dickson       was elected   a Fellow in 1869, and           he took much
 interest in the proceedings of the Royal           Society, although modesty
 prevented him from any active part in its discussions.
    He was an enthusiast in the cause of education, to which for
 upwards     of forty    years   he  devoted his       enlightened     talent and
 unwearied energies.
    He died    on the 15th    April  1889.
