     1. On the    Colours of Natural Bodies.                   By Sir David
          Brewster, V.P.R.S. Ed.
   The only Theory of the Colours of Natural Bodies that has met
with reception in modern times, is that of Sir Tsaac Newton, who
considers them as identical with those of thin plates, and as vary
ing with the size of the ultimate particles of the body.
   Although this theory, ingenious as it            is,
                                            be liable to many great
objections, and be not capable of explaining the phenomena, even
ifits postulates be admitted   yet the author of the present paper
                                      ;
does not assail    with
                      itany arguments of this kind.    He has, on
the contrary, attacked      in its stronghold, and has endeavoured to
                               it
bring    to the test of direct experiment.
          it
   Sir Isaac Newton considers the green colour of plants (the most
general colour which nature presents to us) as      green of the third
                                                          a
order of periodical colours, and has also given us the exact com
position of this particular colour.
     Inorder to determine the composition of the green colour of
plants, the author dissolved their colouring matter in alcohol; and
having analyzed   by     fine prism, he found
                        it     a                to have, in every
                                                          it
case, the same composition.   The portions of the spectrum, how
ever, which entered into its compound tint, were totally different
from its theoretical composition, as assigned Sir Isaac Newton
                                                          by                          ;
and had no relation whatever to the colour of their plates.                         The

                                        4
  green colouring matter exercised an arbitrary specific action upon
  different parts of the spectrum, and its green colour was owing to
  its having absorbed a certain number of rays, which, when sub
  tracted from the white light, left the colour under consideration.
      In order to render this result more general, the author examined
  an immense number of coloured solutions, obtained from plants and
  artificial salts, and a great variety of coloured solids, either formed
  by art, or obtained in nature      ; and in all these cases, he found no
  indication whatever of periodical colours.         The colours    were inva
  riably produced by the absorption of certain definite rays taken
  arbitrarily and unequally from different parts of the spectrum ;
  and, excepting in the case     of certain imperfectly transparent and
  opalescent   fluids, there never    was the slightest trace of a reflected
  tint similar to that which might have been expected had the New
  tonian theory been true.
      2. Notice respecting the Determination of the Geogra
         phical Positions of the Village of Chamouni, and of
         the Convent of the Grand St Bernard. By James D.
         Forbes, Esq., F.R.SS.L.& Ed.
     The author undertook the determinations of these positions at
 the suggestion of Professor Gautier of Geneva, who informed him
 that they had not been        fixed by any direct observations.            The
 great discrepancies of the best maps of the Alps in laying them
 down confirm this opinion ; and the author has quoted the lati
 tudes and longitudes, given by the best authorities,          at tho end of
 his paper.
     The   new determinations     give for the positions —

                        ....

         St Bernard,                45°    50'   16" .  . .   28™     19'
     The latitudes were determined          by successive   altitudes of the
pole star, taken with an altitude and azimuth circle, upon Captain
Kater's construction, the circles being 4£ inches in diameter, and
divided to 15".        The position of St Bernard is the best deter
mined, eight altitudes of the pole star having been taken, the re
sults of seven of which agree closely.
    The longitudes were determined chronometrically,             in the   first
place,   by comparisons with the Geneva Observatory clock, and in

 the second, by the time at the two places, calculated from altitudes
 of the   sun taken with the instrument just mentioned.      Though
 the rate of the chronometer was wonderfully steady, considering
 the shocks to which it was exposed, the author does not conceive
 that the longitudes are determined with very great precision.

   1.  Researches on the Conducting Power of the Metals
      for Heat and Electricity, tending to establish a New
      Analogy between these prineiples.            By James D.
      Forbes, Esq., F.R.SS.L. A: Ed.
   The paper began by pointing out the very limited class of bodies

                                             (i
to which observations of the kind alluded to have been extended.
The author            was led to a careful examination        of the existing deter
minations of the conducting powers of the metals for heat, by some
collateral trains of experiment in which he was occupied two years
ago.   He points out the degree of confidence which may be placed
in the arrangement            of conductors given by different authors           ;   for
we appear to be            far from reaching      a correct estimate of their nu
merical values.  In viewing those of M. Despretz as the best, he
remarks, that the position of platinum, which is certainly errone
ous, shews how imperfectly we can depend upon experiments on
this point, made with even more than usual care.        Platinum is
placed by   this writer almost at the top of the list, between gold
and silver, whilst the commonest experiments                       serve to shew that
it is really a very imperfect conductor.
   In order to verify the conclusions of previous observers, and to
determine the position of some metals upon which no experiments
seem to have been made, the author employed Fourier's Thermo
meter of Contact, an elegant instrument,               which he believes has not
before been practically  applied. His experiments, however, being
only intended for the illustration of a subject of collateral inquiry,
were not made with              the detail that they would otherwise have
been,  nor are they presumed to be perfectly accurate.     They
served, however, to confirm previous experiments on the order of
the metals as conducting substances ; to restore platinum to its
right place, and to fix the positions of antimony and bismuth.
From      these and other data, he considers the following as the most
probable arrangement of conductors of heat, beginning with the
best : — Gold, Silver, Copper, Brass, Iron, Zinc, Platinum, Tin,
Lead, Antimony, and Bismuth.
   In like manner, by          a careful comparison of the results         of Harris,
Becquei     and Pouillet, including some experiments on antimony
                ol,
and bismuth, made at the author's request      Mr Harris, he con
                                                             by
cludes, that the arrangement of the metals as conductors of elec
tricity  the following, which he observes
          i;-
                                          probably better esta
                                                        is
blished than the corresponding one for heat — Silver, Copper,  :
Gold, Zinc, Brass, Iron, Platinum, Tin, Lead, Antimony, and
Bismuth.   He observes, that the deviations from  common ar           a
rangement only occur « here       agreed,
                                       it   is           by
                                              experiments on both
points, that the metals are extremely closely allied as, for exam    :

pie, Gold and Silver, Iron and Platinum.              His general conclusion
is this  ;   That   the    arrangement of conductors       of  heat  does   not
differ more     from     that  of conductors of electricity, than either ar
rangement does alone under the hands of different observers.

    The following communications were then read : —
    1. On the Super- Sulphuretted              Lead of Dufton.       By  J.  F.
       W. Johnston, Esq., A.M., F.R.S.E.
    The object of the author of this paper             was to shew that     the
mineral alluded to is not a new atomic compound, but that it con
sists merely of common sulphate of lead, with a portion of pure
sulphur, varying from 6 to 10 per cent.
    2. The reading of Dr Knox's paper on the Natural His
       tory of the Salmon was concluded.
    The object of the author was a careful examination of facts in
the Natural History of the Salmon, which hitherto have been
taken merely upon opinion.              He watched and carefully     observed
personally the deposition of the ova or eggs of tho salmon under
the gravel, — -its long confinement in that situation, — its growth
into a fish       about an     inch   in  length, — its ascent   through the
gravel, and rapid growth              whilst in the rivers :    the journals
of observation wore partly read            to the  Society.    Twenty   weeks
was the period          from the    time of deposition to their bursting
the outer shell       ;   for nine days longer they continued under the
gravel     as fishes,   drawing their nourishment from the yolk of the

                                      8
 egg, which is of course   attached to them by the umbilical vessels,
 or more properly, by the ompholo-mesenteric vessels.                During
 this period they do not eat or grow much, but without doubt
 acquire strength.     When the yoke      on which they have been feed
 ing becomes     nearly exhausted,    they rise from their sandy and
gravelly bed, making their way to the surface, through a thickness
 varying from one to two feet, and at lust gain their new habitat in
 the waters.     In ten days they may bo caught in the rivers, very
 considerably grown, and in twenty days have             attained a length
 varying from six to nine inches.
    An extensive personal inquiry       shewed that they are nevor the
 prey ol trout; and a more limited       one renders   it doubtful if they
 ever become the prey     of kelt, or spawned salmon, on its return to
 the ocean. It is probably to avoid the effects of severe frosts, that
 the salmon selects the bed of the running stream as the spot for
 the favourable deposition of the ova. The beds of rivers, he con
jectures,    must vary somewhat in temperature           ;  and the author
supposes     that extreme frosts are less likely to reach the gravel
under the stream than under the pool. Frequent experiment has
convinced the author, that the opinions of Sir Humphry Davy,
Jacobi, and others, —opinions which maintain               that the gravel
 below  the stream is selected    by the  salmon,   on  the ground of the
 better aeration of the ova, have no real foundation whatever.
    The   food of the fry has been determined        precisely,   and   their
whole habits, by repeated anatomical examinations made by him
 self.
    The salmon     seems to hybernate somewhat in certain seasons; a
great number of salmon and trout do not enter into the spawning
condition, and consequently may be got in first-rato order as food
at any time, provided they have the means of subsistence : now,
this the salmon can always get at in the ocean, which is his true
feeding ground.      He cannot get food in rivers of the kind he de
sires.    1 ho salmon-trout,   on the contrary,    even at the mouths of
rivers, will take to the fry of other fishes, to small fishes, and
to worms ; and in rivers, he will feed on the larvaj of insects, in
sects themselves, and, in short, on the ordinary         food  of trout.
    Tho true salmon prefers      a  peculiar   kind of food, the ova of
the echinodermata,      and takes    with great reluctance any other.
Hence,     the moment     he  enters    rivers,   having    abandoned     his

                                   9
natural feeding-ground, he deteriorates constantly, refuses all kind
of food, loses weight and flavour, and gets, in short, entirely out
of order.    Nor can   he ever recover from this state   till he has re
visited the feeding-ground in the ocean.     It is easy to perceive in
these few statements, how entirely they alter the whole question
of  the salmon-fisheries.
    These inquiries led the author to examine into the history of the
herling.   They resemble in their habits the salmon-trout, haunt
ing the feeding-ground of the salmon ; and when fed on the pecu
liar food of the salmon, their flavour is excellent ; but they take
readily to coarser food, as small herrings, fry, sand-eels, and the
fry of any other fishes.     Their stomach and intestines get loaded
with putrescent debris, their flesh loses its flavour, and their con
dition, as articles of human food, has changed materially.       No two
conditions can be supposed more opposite than the herling pre
sents when fed on salmon food,      and when fed on fishes.        They
differ, therefore, from salmon-trout in this respect, that, when feed
ing on the food of the salmon, they attain almost the flavour of the
salmon, which the salmon-trout      never does.
    The author discovered and exhibited the     food of the Vendace of
Lochmaben,      which had never been seen before by any one        ; ex
plained the reasons why this fish could not be taken with bait ;
proved the vendace to be male and female, and offers suggestions
for the stocking of the various lakes in Britain with this exquisite
fish, pointing out first the necessity of locating its natural food,
without which it cannot live.        The discovery of these circum
stances with regard to the vendace, led the author immediately to
think of the herring, whose food and natural history generally ho
believed to be unknown.
    It was ascertained that the  herring resembles the vendace in its
habits, as to food more particularly ; and that whilst feeding on the
incredibly minute entomostraceous animals, which it moro espe
cially affects, the condition of the herring is excellent, rendering
it an extremely desirable food for man. In this state, the sto
mach seems       as if almost altogether empty     (as in the vendace),
though at the moment full of minute animals, to be discovered
only with the microscope, and on which the animal has been feed
ing.    The intestines also seem as if empty ; the tunics of the
 whole digestive canal are fine and semitransparent, and as free of

                                    10
 intestinal and putrescent debris found in the stomach and intes
 tines of animals, as if the herring actually fed on nothing but air
 and water.    When     he approaches    the shores, thus quitting the
 proper feeding-ground,    he takes to other and coarser food ; his
condition alters, and his flesh becomes       soft and tasteless.    Tin;
stomach and intestines are found loaded with putrescent remains,
and gutted or ungutted, this fish could never be brought into the
market as equal to the product of the Dutch fisheries.

Account of some Optical Phenomena                 observed upon the
    Rigi,  on the 16th October 1832.            By James D. Forbes,
    Esq., F.R.SS.L.&Ed.
    The object of this paper was to describe an example of a class
of phenomena, which is imperfectly understood.           The author ob
served an indistinct mass of reflected light, surrounded by a faint
glory, on the surface of a stratum of thick white clouds, 1000 or
1200 feet below him, when descending from the Rigi-           The centre
of the coloured circle was the point diametrically opposite to the
sun, and consequently varied with the position of the observer.
As   he approached the level  of the cloudy   ocean, the colours became
brighter, and the circle more distinctly formed, and the shadows of
the author and his companion were thrown with distinct outlines

                                    11
upon the    illuminated surface.   The diameter of  the red   ring of  the
corona was about 18°, and he ascertained, by experiment, that the
distance   of the plane on which it was formed, was only 70 feet.
The red occupied the interior of the prismatic circle. When com
pletely immersed in the cloud, tho shadow of the observer assumed
a new appearance, owing to the want of a definitely illuminated
surface upon which it could be thrown ; and the continuation of
the shadow towards the interior of the cloud, presented the aspect
of shadows when a sunbeam is admitted into an atmospheric space
filled with light dust   ; and, by the effect of perspective, gave an
appearance of a true convergence of rays, such as is occasionally
observed on a great scale opposite to the sun.
     The author pointed out that the theory of the coloured rings
suggested      by Mr Fraunhofer is untenable.     It supposes the in
flexion of rays by watery particles round the head of the observer,
whilst experience shews, that these effects are produced when the
observer stands in a perfectly pure atmosphere, and even at the
distance of 1000 feet from the cloud.       The theory of Dr Young
 was also noticed, which     presumes a quadruple reflection in the
interior of the aqueous drops ; an opinion which, perhaps, it may
be difficult to reconcile with the great brilliancy of the colours
displayed.

     The principal object of this paper was to defend some interpre
  tations of words in the ancient language of Etruria, proposed by
  Lanzi, and attacked by Niebuhr ; as well us to point out some new
  analogies with othor dialects.      The languages which the author
  proposes   particularly  to call to his assistance  are, Greek, Latin,
  Anglo-Saxon,     and Cambrian or Welsh.        The paper concluded with
  an application   of  these aids to a  variety of words in the Etruscan

    On the Gradual Elevation of Land in High                  Northern
       Latitudes.       By  J. F. W.    Johnston, Esq., F.R.S.Ed.
    In this paper, the author     shewed,   by a number    of phenomena
observable within the coasts of Sweden, chiefly around Stockholm,
and on the shores of the Lake Macler and its arms, that the con
clusion of the Swedish surveyors in 1821, that       a  change of the re
lative level of the land and w ater along the coasts of the Baltic had
in many localities taken place, could not reasonably be disputed.

                                          13
He then considered if it        were possible        that the level of the Baltic
could hare fallen, being, by its connection with the North Sea, a
branch of the great ocean ; and concluded, from the permanency
of the respective level of the land and water on the coasts of Po-
merania, among the Danish islands, and at some points on the
shores of Finland, that the level of the Baltic Sea had undergone
no change of level for the last six hundred years.     The change
observable on the coasts of Sweden, therefore, must be due to an
elevation of the land, now gradually, though                  insensibly, in pro
gress.       This rising    is estimated to proceed at present at the rate
of   about   one foot in twenty-five      years.
     The   absence   of any record of violent volcanic action in the Scan
dinavian Peninsula, renders it improbable that the rise is due to
such a cause.        The author referred        it,
                                          therefore, to the gradual
cooling of the crust of the earth, which,      causing  by
                                                         contractiona
and compression in parts where the cooling was a maximum tend
ing to elevate other portions of the earth's surface at points or in
lines of minimum resistance.
     The centre of the action in Scandinavia, he                considered   to be
in   the mountain chains which traverse               Norway and Sweden, and
Finland, respectively    and which are mutually connected beyond
                            ;
the head of the Bothnian Gulf: and attributing the original ele
vation of these chains, with Elie de Beaumont, to the secular re
frigeration of the earth, he found in the rise still observable in
Scandinavia    relic only of that once powerful action by which
                a
these mountain ranges were originally            projected.    He   suggested     the
probability, also, that on other coasts whore high mountain ridges
ran parallel with the sea, accurate measurements of the mean level
of the water, in reference to the scarped rocks on thu coast,   re           if
peated at certain distant intervals, might make known other gra
dual elevations still in progress, similar to those observable on the
shores     of the Baltic.

     1. Observations       on the Anatomy of the Rorqual (a
        Whalebone Whale of the largest magnitude), drawn
       up from the dissection of a specimen found dead off
        North Berwick.         By Robert Knox, M.D., F.R.S.Ed.
    This paper,   composed chiefly  of anatomical details regarding the
anatomical structure     of  the Rorqual, scarcely admits of abridge
ment.      The author has described the skeleton of the cavity for
receiving the brain, and the mechanism of the larynx, at greatest
length.      The entire length of the whale, measured by a straight
line,  drawn   on the sand from the nose to the middle part of the tail,
and making a slight allowance for the curved position in which the
animal lay, was 80 feet.          Length of the head 23 feet.       The
girth of   the carcass at the pectoral extremities (though the animal
had beon ten days on the beach, and was much collapsed) 34 feet.
Breadth of the tail from tip to tip 20 feet.       The author describes
the appearance of the mouth, lined with whalebone, as very sur
prising.      The whole surface of the palatal plates of the superior
maxillary bones, each extending to 14 feet in length, was covered
with a mass of what appeared to be well-teased baked hair, of a
clear and shining black.        This was the whalebone, arranged in
the most regular manner, and composed of many thousand plates ;
the number as seen in profile, and which aro the largest plates,
amounted to upwards of 650.           It weighed nearly two tons while
soft.     The whole skeleton weighed nearly thirty-two tons, and
was removed to Edinburgh with much difficulty.            The weight of
the brain, calculated by Sir William Hamilton's method, from the
capacity of the cranium, must have been about fifty-four lbs.
     The larynx is quite simple, and totally unlike that of the Dol
 phin and Porpoise.       The nostrils are filled by two enormous car
 tilaginous masses,    acted on by muscles occupying the centre of
 the superior maxillary bones.      When the animal breathes, they are
 withdrawn sideways to      admit of the passage of air.    This extra

                                   15
ordinary structure the author considers as unique, and that it had
not fallen previously   under the notice of any scientific observer.
   2.  Dr Knox verbally communicated       some new observations on
the structure  of the Foot of the Horse.     He demonstrated the na
vicular bone    of the horse's foot not to be a sesamoid   bone, nor a
peculiar structure formed expressly for the horse, but the Epi
physis of the Os pedis or coffin-bone.      This was proved satisfac
torily by  a direct appeal   to structure.   Besides anticipating   re
sults of practical consequence from this discovery,      the author   is
led to observe,   that an organ may be displaced and employed to
perform   different functions in different animals, — that the epi
physes of bones are intended by nature to form separate bones in
a vast variety   of animals, — and that they may often lead to the
discovery of the type of the skeleton in fossil remains of extinct
animals.

       certain   vibrations which take place between Metallic
       Masses having different Temperatures."             By James D.
       Forbes, Esq., Professor of Natural Philosophy in the
       University of Edinburgh.
    The vibrations  here referred to, are those which, with their accom
panying sounds, were first observed by Mr Arthur Trevelyan, and
communicated to this Society in a paper published in the 12th vol.
of their Transactions.     The author of the present paper undertook
the inquiry as soon as the remarkable       fact was announced by     Mr
Trevelyan, and was induced to prosecute it to a considerable extent
experimentally, in consequence of being dissatisfied with the only
plausible explanation yet offered, — that of tho successive expansions
of the cold metal by the hot one at the point of contact at each sue

                                                     18
 cessivo vibration,       which       was   conceived          to afford         the    necessary   im
 pulse or maintaining              power.
    In this paper, the phenomena of sound are first discussed, which,
 with Mr Faraday, the author imputes solely to the number of vibra
 tions taking place in a given space of time. This seems completely
 proved by observation, and the note depends upon the frequency
 of the oscillations, which have been observed as hio-h as between
 700 and 800 in a second, and must often                             be greatly more         frequent.
 The phenomena of vibration are next considered as affected by the
 nature of the metals, by the form of the masses, and by temperature.
 The order of        the metals as vibrators,             is the following,            meaning that
the cold metal must always stand lower in the list than the hot one,
 and that the         force or intensity of vibration                      is,
                                                                     generally speaking,
 proportional       to the space intervening              between two metals on the list,
Silver, Copper, Gold, Zinc, Brass, Platinum, Iron, Tin, Lead, Anti
mony, Bismuth.     Antimony and Bismuth are placed at the bottom
of the list, because          no other         metal      is    capable, under any circum
stances which have been examined, of producing vibrations in con
junction with those two metals   they are the only metals yet ob
                                                 :
served which, when heated, do not vibrate on cold lead.
     From experiments detailed at considerable length in the paper,                                 the
author      is   led to the following practical                conclusions, which, whatever
may be the fate     of the hypothesis which he   disposed to found up is
on     them, will, he conceives, be viewed as valuable in themselves.
1.   As far      as has been       observed,     the vibrations          never take place be
tween       substances    of the same          nature.          2.   Both substances must be
metallic.         3. The vibrations         take place with an intensity propor
tional,within certain               limits, to the difference of the conducting
powers of the metals for        (or electricity,*) the metal having the
                                     heat
least conducting power being necessarily the coldest.      4. The time
of contact of two points of the metals (between which the oscillations
take place) must be longer than that of the intermediate                                    portions.
5.  The impulse       received
                         is                 by
                                    distinct and separate process at
                                                 a
each contact of the bar with the block, and in no case     the connec                  is
tion of these points in any way essential.  6. The intensity of vibra
                                                                  of
tion   (under certain exceptions), proportional to the difference
       is
temperature of the two metals.
  From these data, the author first endeavours to show, that the
hypothesis of expansion      untenable,
                                     is    tracing closely the process
                                                           by
of communication   of heat, and  proving that    must lead to severalit
conclusions totally at variance with experiment, and particularly
 *   See the abitract    of   a   former paper on the identity of those arrangements.

                                      10
that as far as conducting power for heat is concerned, both the hot
and the cold metal should possess it in the highest degree.               The
author is led by the striking analogy of the powerful repulsive action
of electricity in passing (tom a good to a bad conductor, to infer a
similar property in heat, which, without entering into any specu
lations as to the nature of those principles, appear to have a repul
sive character in common indicated        by a tendency to     diffusion  and
equilibrium.     He conceives, that while some very delicate experi
ments in France have given indications of the actual force exerted
by heat equally diffused through two adjoining             masses, that the
energy in this case is produced by the accumulated repulsive power
in the last particles of the good conductor, the current (without
meaning any thing hypothetical by the term) being suddenly cut
short by the resistance opposed     by the inferior conductor to its pass
age.     The destructive energy of electricity indicative of its repulsive
force,  is never exerted in a state of equilibrium,     but by the accumu
lation of separate repulsive energies which take place in the transi
tion from a good to a bad conductor, or during its passage through
the latter.
       2. On the   Equations of Loci traced upon the surface of the
           Sphere, as expressed by spherical co-ordinates.                 By
          T. S. Davies, Esq., F.R.S.E.
    This paper   is intended   as a necessary   supplement     to the   paper
bearing the same title already printed in the Society's Transactions,
though but an abridgment of a larger one which the author had pre
pared on the subject.      Particular circumstances induced him to alter
the plan he had     originally contemplated, and instead of a complete
development in detail of his researches and his views, he has only on
the present occasion given so much of his results as were necessary
to bring the system of polar spherical co-ordinates to a state analo
gous to that in which plane polar curves has long been stationary,
one point of the analogy excepted, viz. where the author has extend
ed the method of treating tangents and normals,          and the consequent
investigations   dependent on these, by giving      the polar    equations of
those lines, instead of merely examining        the   relation  between    the
radius-vector,   and perpendicular     upon the tangent.      In   a note the
equations of the tangent and normal, to plane curves, is given from
first principles ; and the analogy botween plane and spherical curves
is shown to be remarkably close.

                                                20
   Amongst          the properties    of spherical turves, the following curious
one occurs.
   If     the pole of      a   loxodrome       to rhumb     « be made   the centre of
another equal sphere, the visual cone under which the loxodrome will
appear, will cut the second           (the eye being at centre of first
                                        sphere
sphere) in a curve, whose     equatorial subtangent is constant, and
equal to * : and if conversely, the polo of the spherical logarithmic
(the equisubtangcntial curve just mentioned) be made the centre of
an equal sphere, the  visual cone of this logarithmic, seen from the
centre of its own sphere, will cut the second sphere in a loxodrome
whose rhumb is equal to tho subtangent of the logarithmic.
   The author          expresses     his     intention   of discussing in     a separate
work the singular points of spherical                curves, certain new systems of
co-ordinates, and other classes of research, which, on account of the
length to which they necessarily extend, were                    not adapted     to the
Transactions of the Royal Society.
          3.    Experiments and Observations on the Arterialization
               of the Blood. By William Gregory, M.D., F.R.S.E.,
               and W. J. Irvine, Esq.
   The object of        these experiments was to ascertain somo of the              cir
cumstances under which the blood changes                    in colour, from the dark
venous to tho florid arterial hue.
   Dr Stevens first           that the venous clot deprived of its serum
                           showed,
by washing, remained dark even when in contact with oxygen ; and
t hat the addition of a salino solution caused it immediately to become
florid.        Ho   stated also, that a strong saline solution would cause this
change  in an atmosphere so highly charged with carbonic acid as to
prove rapidly fatal to animals.
   It appeared to the authors necessary to ascertain whether this
effect took place in pure carbonic acid containing                no free oxygen, as
the atmosphere used            by   Dr Stevens       most  probably did; and they
also proposed         to extend      their    observations to other gases, likewise
free    from oxygen.           They accordingly prepared pure nitrogen, hy
drogen, and carbonic acid, removing the last traces of oxygen by
means of potassium.  The water with which the clot was washed,
and the saline solution used in the experiments, were deprived of at
mospheric air by being boiled and allowed to cool in close vessels.
The clot                        into the gasos over mercury, and as
                was then introduced
soon as the strong saline solution came in contact with  the colour,    it,
in all the three gases, changed from black to bright red. and the
same change          was   found to take        place in the   Torricellian Vacuum.

                                      21
It  was obvious, therefore, that a strong       saline solution could change
the colour of     the blood from venous    to arterial    without the contact of
oxygen, or indeed of any gas whatever.
    But in blood, the colouring matter is in contact, not with a strong
saline solution, but with a very dilute one, viz. the serum.                It was
necessary,   therefore, to see whether the washed clot, placed in con
tact with serum or a weak solution of salt, in the same gases, would
change its colour.       On repeating the experiments, both with serum
and a solution of salt in water of equal strength             to the serum, no
change whatever took place, until atmospheric air or oxygen                gas was
admitted.
    The conclusions of Dr Stevens, therefore, must             be somewhat mo
dified.   It  is true, as he states,  that the presence      of saline matter     is
essential to the change of colour : But it is obvious, that there is an
essential difference between that change as it occurs in the lungs,
where serum is present, and as it appears out of the body when a
strong saline solution is employed.          In the former case, oxygen is
necessary : In the latter, the change of colour is independent of the
presence of any gas whatever.         We must, therefore, be cautious how
we reason by analogy from the one class of phenomena to the other.

    1.  Observations       on the Lines of the Solar Spectrum, and
       on those produced by the Earth's Atmosphere, and by
       the Action of Nitrous Acid Gas. By Sir David Brewster,
       LL.D..F.R.S.
    The author      was ltd, in prosecution of his researches      on the absorp
tive action of transparent       media   of light, which have        bnen    partly
communicated         in previous  papers   to the Society,       to examine     the

                                       22
 influence of coloured gaseous bodies.         Iodine vapour was one of
these, and its action was found of a similar character to that of fluids
 having a similar tint.     Nitrous acid  gas presented  a  far more extra
 ordinary phenomenon.
    The Spectrum of Newton, and of all the philosophers of the 18th
century, was a parallelogram of light with circular ends, in which
the seven colours gradually shaded into each other without any inter
 ruption.    The illumination was a maximum in the yellow rays, and
the light decayed by insensible degrees      towards the red and violet
extremities.     In the year 1808, Dr Wollaston       conceived  the happy
dea   of examining a beam of day-light that passed through an aper
ture only the 20th of an inch wide, and he was surprised to see it
crossed by seven dark lines, perpendicular to its length.
    About   ten  or twelve years afterwards,      the celebrated optician,
Joseph    Fraunhofer,   without    knowing what had been done by Dr
 Wollaston,   observed the spectrum formed by the s,un's light trans
 mitted through small apertures ; and by applying a telescope be
 hind the prism, he discovered about 600 parallel dark lines travers
 ing the spectrum.      As no such lines appeared in the spectra of
 white flames, Fraunhofer considered them as having their origin in
the nature of the light of the sun.      The strongest of these lines were
seen in the spectra of the Moon, Mars, and Venus ; and by means
of very fine instruments,    he was able to detect one or two of them
with other new lines in the spectra of Sirus and Castor.
     Upon examining with a fine prism of rock-salt, with the largest
 possible refracting angle (nearly 78°), the light of a lamp transmit
ted through a small thickness of nitrous acid gas, whose colour was a
pale straw-yellow,    the author was surprised to observe the spectrum
crossed with hundreds     of lines or bands far more distinct than those
of the solar spectrum.      The lines  were sharpest and darkest     in the
 violet and blue spaces, fainter in the green, and extremely faint in
the yellow and red spaces.       Upon increasing, however, the thickness
of the gas, the lines grew more and more distinct in the yellow and
red spaces, and became broader in the blue and violet, a general ab
sorption advancing from the violet extremity, while a specific absorp
tion was advancing on each side of the fixed lines in the spectrum.
It was not easy to obtain a sufficient thickness of gas to develop the
lines at the red extremity,     but the author   found that heat produced
the same absorptive power as increase of thickness, and by bringing
a tube containing a thickness of half an inch of gas to a high tempe
rature, he was able to render every line and band in the red rays
distinctly visible.

                                          23
     The power of heat        alone to render a gas which is almost colour
less as red as blood without decomposing              it,   is   in   itself   a    most singu
lar result     ;                        in rendering the same palo
                   and the author succeeded
nitrous acid gas so absolutely black by heat, that not   ray of the            a
brightest summer's sun was capable of penetrating it.   In making
the experiment,          the tubes    frequently    exploded  using   ;    but      by       a
mask of mica and thick gloves, and placing the tubes in cylinders of
tinned iron with narrow slits to admit the light, there little danger       is
of any serious accident.
   The author then points out various practical applications which
may be made of this discovery, especially its substitution for the
more difficult process, when Fraunhofer's lines in the solar spectrum
are employed, of determining the dispersive powers of substances.
Since     the absorptive       action,   by   increasing         the thickness           of the
medium, generally enlarges the lines already defined, these may be
rendered as distinct as may be required, which      impracticable to
                                                                 it   is
do  with the solar lines, and hence the difficulty of applying these to
useful purposes.      The lines in the sun's light, and those of the
nitrous acid gas spectrum, when directly compared, have a strong
analogy    but in order to establish
           ;                            completely, the author found
                                               it
Fraunhofer's map of the solar spectrum insufficient, and was induced
to undertake the laborious task of going over the whole ground.
By dint of perseverance, and by the use of some original methods,
he has been enabled, with            very inferior instruments, to distinguish
about     2000      lines, instead   of the 354 which Fraunhofer had laid
down.
     The author watched narrowly the state of               the defective solar lines
at different       seasons of the year, in order to observe                 if   any change
took place in the combustion by which the sun's light   generated,             is
or in the solar atmosphere through     which    must  pass.  Such
                                                             it
changes he found to be very general in every species of terrestrial
flame.   The definite yellow rays which exist in almost all white
lights, flicker with variable lustre, and analogous rays in the green
                         a
and blue spaces proceeding from the bottom of the flame, exhibit the
same inconstancy of illumination.    In the course of the winter obser
vations, he observed         distinct lines and     bands in the red and green
spaces, which at other times wholly disappeared   but diligent com
                                                                 ;         a
parison of these observations soon showed that these lines and bands
depended on the proximity of the sun to the horizon, and were pro
duced    the absorptive action of the earth's atmosphere.
          by
  The atmospheric lines, as they may be called, or those lines and
bands which are absorbed by the elements of an atmosphere, have

                                       24
 their distinctness a maximum when the sun sinks beneath            the hori
 zon.     The study of them consequently becomes exceedingly difficult
 in a climate where the sun, even in a serene day, almost always sets
 in clouds   ; but the author has been able to execute     a tolerably accu
 rate delineation of the atmospheric spectrum.
     Most of the lines thus widened by the atmosphere, are faint lines
 previously existing in the spectrum.
     The author's observations, whilst they indicate   the remarkable fact,
 that the same     absorptive elements which     exist in nitrous acid gas
 exist also in the atmospheres of the sun and of the earth, lead us to
 anticipate very interesting results from the examination of the spec
tra of the planets.      Fraunhofer had observed in the spectra of Venus
and Mars some of the principal lines of the solar spectrum.            This,
 indeed,   is a necessary  consequenco   of their being illuminated by the
sun ; for no change which the light of that luminary can undergo is
capable of replacing the rays which it has lost.        But while we must
 find in the spectra of the planets and their satellites all the defective
lines in the solar spectrum, we may confidently look for others aris
ing from the double transit of the sun's light through the atmospheres
which surround them.
        2.  Notice relative to the Pigmentum Nigrum of the Eye.
           By Thomas Wharton Jones, Esq.
    The objects proposed by the author of this paper are, —
     1. To correct certain opinions prevalent with regard to the mem
brane of Jacob, this having been frequently confounded with ano
ther, the structure of       which forms the immediate subject of the
paper.
    2.  To show that the Pigmentum Nigrum is not a mere mucus or
varnish exhaled by the surfaces on which it is found, but is deposited
in a membrane distinct from the choroid, which possesses a peculiar
structure hitherto unknown.        This membrane, being the      seat of the
pigment, but not the pigment itself, which may or may not be pre
sent, the author proposes to call the Membrane of the Pigment.
    If  a portion   of this membrane be examined by the aid of the
microscope, it is seen to consist of very minute hexagonal plates, in
which are deposited numerous black particles, which are to be consi
dered as properly constituting     the pigment, but not essential to the
hexagonal plates composing the membrane, because these may, and
do, exist without the black particles.
    In  the eye  of the Albino Rabbit, the author found,      as he had a
priori expected, the membrane of       the pigment to exist.     The  plates

                                     25
composing which, however, are still less developed than those of that
part of the membrane which lies over the tapetum, in the eyes of the
horse, ox, &c.      They are in fact not hexagonal, but circular, a struc
ture similar to which the author has found in the eye of a very
young human foetus.
   Behind and around the ciliary processes, and on the posterior sur
face of the iris, the membrane of the pigment ceases to present the
hexagonal structure, although still composed of small irregularly
rounded masses of about the same size as the hexagonal plates, to
which they are evidently analogous.
   This change in the structure of the membrane of the pigment,
which is only partial in the eyes of the Mammiferea, the author has
found to obtain in its whole extent, in the eyes of those animals
lower in the zoological scale which he has examined, except in the
eye of the Cuttlefish, in which there is an approach to the hexagonal
structure in that part of the pigment which lies on the posterior sur
face  of the part in which    the crystalline  lens is fixed.

        Johnston, Esq., F.R.S.E.
    This paper described the composition of some crystallized slags
from Birtley Iron-Works, in the County of Durham.               These slags,
like those from Wales described by Professor Miller in the Cam
bridge Transactions, had the form of the olivine, and in composition
were nearly pure silicate of iron, containing about 0*4 per cent, of
foreign matter, chiefly magnesia.         The author also gave a short ac
count of a method by which the magnet might be made available in
giving immediately very near approximations to the quantity of iron
contained in the basic silicates of iron.
   At    the Birtley Iron- Works, the author stated that beautiful crys
tals of titanium had likewise been found.

        The following Communications were then read                      : —
    1.   On a New Species of Coloured Fringes developed between
        certain pieces of plate-glass, exhibiting a new variety of
        polarization, and a peculiar property which renders them
        available for the purposes of Micrometry.                       By Mungo
        Ponton, Esq.
    The author, when he first observed these fringes, found that they
 presented the appearance of three rectilinear bands, each consisting
 of black, white, and coloured stripes ; but the central band was after
 wards found to be composed of two united into one.                    There is thus
a band for each of the four surfaces of the plates, the two side ones,
appertaining to the uppermost and undermost surfaces, and the cen
 tre ones to the surfaces which are approximated.                  The peculiarities
 by which they       are distinguished     are as follows   : —

                                      32
    1st, They  are confined    to certain specimens of glass, but not to
perfectly parallel plates.
    2d, They are exhibited while the plates are at a considerable dis
tance from each other, provided their surfaces are preserved as nearly
parallel as possible ; and they are not affected even by the interposi
tion of another plate between those by which they are formed.
    3d, They are destroyed by the application of Canada balsam or
oil of turpentine to any one of the four surfaces.
    ith, They are of uniform breadth and appearance, so long as the
disposition of the plates remains the same, and are not affected by
pressure in whatever manner it may be applied.              The Newtonian
fringes, on the other hand, are affected, both     in breadth and direction,
by the manner in which the plates are pressed together, so that they
can be produced at right angles, or in any other position, with re
spect to the new bands.
    5th, The fringes under consideration        are produced   by the light
which is returned inwards upon the plates by reflection from their
anterior surfaces, so that the rays suffer three reflections and four
refractions before reaching the eye.
    6th, They present phases of revolution which follow a different
order according to the surfaces that are placed together, and varying,
as the revolution    is made, from right to left or from left to right.
Thu bands revolve only at half the rate at which the plates move
during the first semi-revolution ; and during the last quarter of revo
lution, when certain faces are together, there is a complete breaking
up of the rectilinear fringes, which spread themselves in curvilinear
forms over the whole surface of the plates.
    7th, When viewed by homogeneous light, the fringes appear as
light and dark stripes, covering the entire surface of the plates, and
of uniform breadth which cannot be altered, except by changing the
arrangement of the plates ; but by turning one of these, both the
breadth and direction of the stripes are changed.             Their number
varies from 10 or 12 to nearly 2000.
    8th, The plates which exhibit the fringes do not display any symp
toms of possessing the doubly refracting structure, when viewed by
polarized light.    The appearance of the bands, however, is the       same
as  that of the fringes, produced by crossing wedge-shaped plates of
sulphate of lime, and passing polarized light through them, as de
scribed by    Dr Brewster.       It is therefore probable, that the new
fringes   are occasioned    by  the  intersection of oppositely polarized
pencils of light, whose polarity is induced by the repeated reflections
and refractions which they undergo in passing and repassing through
the plates — and   it would   seem as   if each surface exerted an inde

                                          33
pendent and peculiar polarizing           effect    on the rays, — a hypothesis
-which appears necessary to account for the phenomena attending a
change      in the disposition of the surfaces.
  9th, They possess a peculiar property, which the author conceives
will render them available for the purposes of micrometry.                      When
the surfaces of the plates are parallel, two of the bands are united
into one at the centre  ; but if a film be introduced between the plates,
so as to cause them  slightly to diverge, the two bands in the centre
will be separated, and move laterally from each other, still preserving
their perfect parallelism.     A film, xoryti1 of an inch in thickness,
causes the central bands to separate to a distance of an inch, so that
every -^th of an inch of separation is equivalent to 10^0<)th of an
inch of thickness.    When smaller thicknesses are to be measured,
recourse must be had to the side bands, which are affected by a much
slighter degree of divergence than the centre ones.                A   thickness    so
minute as that of gold leaf may be rendered sensible                    by the side
bands, and a scale for micrometry might be found, by introducing
successive leaves of gold of a known thickness.
   2.      Communication        relative to the Fresh-Water Limestone
        of Burdiehouse, near Edinburgh, belonging to the Carbo
        niferous Group of Eocks.  By Dr Hibbert.
   Inhis paper, the author explains that the limestone in question,
which is confounded with the common carboniferous or mountain
limestone of marine origin,         is,
                              in his opinion, of fresh-water origin.
   On an irregular line extending from Joppa on the coast of the
Firth of Forth, in south and south-west direction to the Fentland
                          a
Hills, strata of mountain or carboniferous limestone crop out at
intervals; and their marine origin    indicatedis              by encrinites,      the
Productus, &c., and corallines. This limestone                is   developed with
least interruption between Edmonstone                and Muirhouso, where          it   is
from twelve to twenty feet thick.    At this part of the line may be
seen fractures and elevations of the strata of limestone and superin
cumbent shale and sandstone, evidently occasioned by                a   sudden and
violent uplifting force acting from north-east to south-west, and
causing the uplifted strata to dip south-east at an anglo of 25°.
These uplifted beds, between Edmonstone and Muirhouse, and sub
sequently to Burdiehouse, form the strata which dip under the coal-
measures of Gilmerton, Loanhead, and other sites.
   At Muirhouse Quarry the           same mountain limestone           is   seen, but   a
 covered state of the ground succeeds          in the   same south-west direction
 for   a   mile,   in which no outcropping strata    are observable, except some
 beds of sandstone about the middle of that space, dipping with the

                                        34
other strata towards the south-east at an angle of 25°, and situated
higher than the limestone.
    At  the south-west termination of this space is situated the Quarry
of Burdiehouse.      It is difficult to determine, from the covered state
of the ground, whether the hed of limestone here seen is lower or
higher than the mountain limestone hitherto described ; possibly the
mountain limestone may here thin off, and be replaced by the Burdie-
house bed.      The appearance of the strata, however, which crop out
between Burdiehouse        and Loanhead, dipping near the former site
towards the south-east at an angle of 30°, and towards the latter at
a less   angle in the same         direction, shew that      the limestone   of
Burdiehouse, in common with the mountain              limestone cropping out
between Edmonstone and Muirhouse, is lower, and therefore of older
formation, than the coal-measures of Gilmerton and Loanhead.             Hence
the limestone of Burdiehouse and the mountain limestone of marine
origin, are jointly referable to one common epoch of formation.
    The Burdiehouse limestone, however, is clearly not of marine, but
of fresh- water origin.     It   forms a bed of twenty-seven feet in thick
ness, composed     of strata about four and a-half feet thick, dipping
south-east at angles of 23° and 25°, with the seams of stratification
regular and continuous,         and also with intersecting      vertical seams.
The bed is surmounted by bituminous shale, with which very thin
layers of limestone occasionally alternate.          The colour of the lime
stone is grey, brown, and occasionally purple           ; its fracture conchoi-
dal, but often slaty, from the intervention of thin striae of vegetable
or bituminous matter     ;  its texture hard and compact ; its aspect dull,
and it is not crystalline     like the limestone of neighbouring quarries.
 It is tolerably pure, shewing little foreign matter except what is bitu
minous ; and this is often disposed between the layers of the lime
 stone where its structure is slaty.        But its most remarkable charac
 ter is the nature of the organic remains contained in it.            These are,
 in the first place, plants belonging to the oldest vegetation of the
globe; among which the Spttenopteris affink, Spltenopterk bifida,
 Leiridostrobus variabilis of Mr Lindley, and various kinds of the L&-
pidodendron, seem to be ascertained.          The   species are numerous and
 distinct, so as to afford the most beautiful      specimens that can be con
 ceived, and a rich store of observation in fossil botany. But, second
ly, the animal remains are even more interesting.              One fragment of
a fish, which, when entire, must have measured a foot in length, is
 closely allied to the fresh-water species of the family of Cyprinidw.
 Innumerable minute animals referable to the fresh-water Enlaaw-
 straca are also to be seen       ; one of these is probably a Cypris, and
 indications have been found of minute Conchifera, and of coprolites
 in great abundance.

                                               35
  The inference          appears to the author          irresistible,      that the Burdie-
house limestone is of fresh-water origin.                   The neighbouring         moun
tain limestone abounds in corallines, encrinites, and shells, all evi
dently marine. These are in vain sought for in the limestone of
Burdiehouse ; which, on the other hand, presents the remains of
Fishes apparently inhabiting fresh-water, and of Ferns, Lycopo-
diaceous plants, and such aquatic vegetables as flourish most among
fresh-water lakes and marshes.   This limestone, then, is the memo
rial of some inland fresh-water lake or tank, within the waters of
which it was elaborated.

        The following communications were read                          :  —
   1.   "A       General View of the Phenomena   displayed in the
        Neighbourhood of Edinburgh by the Igneous Eocks in
        their relations with the Secondary Strata with reference        ;
        to  more particular description of the section which has
             a
        been lately exposed to view on the south side of the Castle
        HilL"        By the Eight Hon. Lord Greenock.
   The author referring, in the introductory part of his paper, to the
views taken by Hutton of the structure of the earth's surface around
Edinburgh, explained, — That the prevailing rocks are strata of sand
stone and shale of the coal formation, with occasional beds of lime
stone and interrupted by insulated as well as grouped hills of igneous
     ;
origin, rising abruptly through them, — That the latter or trap-rocks,
seem in many quarters interstratified with the former, as          they             if
had burst while in    stateaof fusion between the strata of the second
ary rocks, — That fragments of the secondary rocks are often seen
imbedded in the trap, as        they had been broken away from the
                                          if
strata to which they belonged, and been hurried along by the fused
 erupted mass,      — And     that the trap-rocks often present very different
 appearances       in   the same hills, shewing that they were erupted under
 varying circumstances at different periods of time. The author far
 ther explained, that the environs of Edinburgh seem to constitute                            a
 great basin, surrounded by trap-rocks, which dip outwards in all

                                       36
directions from a common centre, — the Pentland           Hills, forming the
southern boundary, the rocky coast of Fife at Burntisland the north
ern, and Salisbury Craigs and Corstorphine Hill the eastern and
western limits.    .
  The paper then proceeds to describe the       appearances    presented by a
late section of the southern face of the Castle   Hill, where several of the
phenomena referred to above are very well illustrated. The great mass
of the Castle Hill rock is a dark compact greenstone.    Towards the
south- west point, altered rocks are seen resting on the trap in a highly
inclined position ; and within the Castle wall, fragments of sandstone
are imbedded    in the greenstone, shewing that the latter must have
burst in a state of fusion through the strata of the former.   But at
the south-east point of the rock, beyond the walls, the section lately
made in cutting the new south-west road has displayed appearances,
which, in the author's opinion, supply strong evidence that, subse
quent to such eruption, the secondary and trap-rocks           had been up
lifted together by a common cause, probably acting on a great extent
of the face of the country.  This section shews five or six beds of
sandstone, with alternate layers of slate-clay or marl.    Signs of
great confusion are found in these strata, more especially as they
approach the point of junction with the trap rock, — their eastern
extremity being thrown upwards, while their western portion is cast
down, so as to lie unconf ormably on the upturned strata ; and near
the point of junction with the greenstone, the ends of the strata of
sandstone and slate-clay are shattered, and have actually fallen over,
so as to come obliquely        in contact with the tabular     masses     of the
greenstone.    Yet it is remarkable, that the sandstone and shale pre
sent no appearance of semi-fusion or intermixture, where they are
in contact with the greenstone ; nor does the greenstone hero pre
sent any imbedded masses of the secondary rocks, nor send out any
veins among their adjacent strata.          At the time, therefore, when
the dislocation of the sandstone strata occurred at the point of junc
tion with the greenstone, the latter could not have been in a state of
fusion ; and the only rational explanation which occurs          is,   that both
rocks were raised, in a solid state, by some common cause, above the
level of the waters under which they were originally formed              ;   and
that the fault or dislocation in the sandstone strata was produced by
some subsidiary        disturbing power acting at the   same period.
   2.   Eesearches on the Vibrations of Pendulums                  in Fluid
        Mediums.         By George Green, Esq.          Communicated         by
        Sir G. Ffrench Bromhead, Bart.
   The author proposes in this paper to resolve         a   particular case of

                                    37
 the motion of fluids, not previously noticed, and susceptible of prac
 tical application, namely, the circumstances of the motion of an inde
 finitely extended non-elastic fluid, where agitated by   a solid  ellipsoi
 dal body moving parallel to itself, according to any given law   ; always
 supposing the body's excursions very small compared with its dimen
 sions.    The question here stated is considered by the author to ad
 mit of an easy general solution. As the principal object of his paper
is to determine the alteration produced in the motion of a pendulum
 by the action of the surrounding medium, he insists more particu
 larly on the case where the ellipsoid moves in a right line parallel to
 one of its axes ; and endeavours to prove that, in order to obtain the
 correct time of a pendulum's vibration, it will not be sufficient merely
 to allow for the loss of weight caused by the fluid medium, but that
 it will likewise  be requisite to conceive the density of the body aug
 mented by a quantity proportional to the density of this fluid.        He
determines the value of the quantity last mentioned, when the body
of the pendulum is an oblate spheroid, vibrating in its equatorial
plane; and finds, that when the spheroid becomes a sphere, the
quantity is precisely equal to half the density of the surrounding
 medium.      Hence in the last case, the true time of the pendulum's
 vibration is obtained, if it be supposed to move in vacuo, and its
mass be simply conceived to be augmented by half that of an equal
volume of the fluid, whilo the moving force with which it is actuated
is diminished by the whole weight of the same volume of fluid.
 8.  Observations on the Fossil Fishes lately found in Orkney.
     By Dr Traill.
    The geologist has been for some time acquainted with the occur
rence of Fossil Fishes of Caithness, and they have been moro latoly
found also in Orkney, especially near Skaill, the seat of W. G.
Watt, Esq. in Pomona.
    The author describes these fishes as imbedded in a dark-coloured
flag, which lies beneath three feet of soil and loose stone, and eleven
feet of solid beds of Bimilar flag, but destitute of organic remains.
The fishes are contained    in two strata, measuring together about two
feet  in thickness.    The upper stratum contains only fishes belonging
to the   Cartilaginei, and seemingly the genus Raia ; the lower con
tains numerous fishes that belong to the orders Thoracici and Abdo-
minales, most of them with distinct scales.      Almost all of them lie
on their bellies or sides, none on their backs, and their attitudes
generally bespeak the energy of their final struggles.      The fishes of
these two contiguous strata are never intermixed.        The strata dip

                                     38
about one foot in seven to the north-west         The author found only
a   single specimen of a    petrified vegetable with the fishes. It was
the leaf of a canna or a reed.
    The Orkney Islands have much uniformity in their geological
structure. The principal rock is this sort of slate, which is connected
with sandstone, and has occasionally interposed thin beds of lime
stone, that seldom contain any organic remains.
    The only primitive rocks in Orkney are in a limited district around
Stromness, and in the contiguous small island of Graemsey.          There
granite, and gneiss approaching to mica-slate, appear in the surface,
and have resting on them a coarse sandstone conglomerate.            This
last is in immediate contact with the slaty rock described above.
The highest ridges in Orkney are the mountains of Hoy, which are
composed of thick beds of sandstone, in which the author lately
discovered a vast bed of trap. This sandstone, as well as that which
occurs in the other islands, belongs to the old sandstone ; and the
slaty rock is probably a newer part of the same formation.
    There are not any distinct traces either of the mountain limestone
or of the coal formation     in Orkney, unless we    are disposed to con
sider this slaty rock as the oldest member of the mountain limestone.
But from its connexion with the sandstone, it is safer to reckon it      a
member of the old red sandstone series.
    Specimens were exhibited to the Society illustrative of the author's
statements.
     4. Notice   of further Discoveries       at Burdiehouse.     By Dr
        Hibbert.
    The author announced that, since his former paper was        read, on
the organic remains of the limestone quarry          at Burdiehouse,  dis
 coveries of still greater interest had  been  made.    These chiefly con
 sist of the remains probably of a large animal of the Saurian tribe,
 namely, what appears to be the epiphysis of one of the vertebrae,
 presenting, when broken across, the cancellated structure of bone —
 several large scales obtained by     Mr Connell, —and, in particular,   a
 large and beautifully perfect tooth, two inches and a quarter long,
 and covered with its enamel, which is quite entire.         The remains
 here alluded to were exhibited and presented by the author and        Mr
 Connell to the Society's Museum.

          Sir T. M. BRISBANE,             President, in the Chair.
       The following Communications            were read   : —
    I. On the Investigation of Magnetic Intensity, by the Oscil
       lations of a Horizontal Needle.          By William Snow Harris,
        F.E.S.
    The chief disturbing causes by which the magnetic intensity, as
ascertained by the oscillations of the horizontal needle, are effected, are
1. Variations in the air in which they are performed ; 2. The influ
ence of changes in the mechanical conditions incidental to the mode
of suspending the needle      ; 3. Changes in the disposition and intensity
of the magnetism of the needle from heat and other causes.
    These causes of disturbance the author proceeded to investigate.
    L He compared the oscillations of the needle vibrating in air,
with those of the same needle oscillating in vacuo ; and he minutely
described the apparatus which he had contrived for allowing the
needle to vibrate freely in an exhausted receiver, and his mode of
determining the arcs of vibration.          This apparatus enabled him to
appreciate the resistance of air to the oscillations of the needle, and
its effect in rendering unequal the duration of vibrations performed
in long and in short arcs.         Hence he inferred the impossibility of
ascertaining the alleged diurnal changes of magnetic intensity by the
common apparatus.
    II.  The second   source  of disturbance he endeavoured to obviate by
a more accurate mode       of suspending the needle ; by which its^centre
of gravity and point of magnetic neutrality should be made to coin
cide.     This the author proposes to accomplish by greater care in
finding its true centre, and in adjusting its horizontality by means
of small sliding counterpoises of platinum on each arm.
    IIL The influence of increase of temperature on the magnetic
 needle has generally been considered as lowering the tension of its
 magnetism ; and it has been represented as again restored by cold :
 but the author's experiments seemed to prove the contrary, when the
 comparative     experiments were made in vacuo.         He considers, how
 ever, that  if the needle be prepared, by being previously exposed to
 a variation   of temperature from 212° to      0° of Fahrenheit, its tension
 will not afterwards    be affected  by ranges of temperature within these
 limits.
    One of the most interesting parts of      Mr Harris's paper is his mode
 of determining changes of magnetic tension in a particular magnet.

                                          40
It   is well known that      if   a   needle be made to vibrate within a ring
of copper, it     willbe more speedily brought to rest, than if vibrating
in open     space.   The influence of the ring of copper, therefore, might
be employed to detect changes            in tension, provided the force which
induced motion in the needle, and that force by which it would eventu
ally be reduced to rest without the ring, were both constant quantities.
This, however is not the case ; but the author proposes to reverse
the experiment, and cause the ring to vibrate round the needle, placed
within      it,
           so as just not to touch the ring.     This will afford    com   a
parative  measure of the force of the  needle at its poles,   we  observe
                                                                   if
the influence of the needle in reducing the ring to         state of rest.
                                                                   a
A convenient mode of doing this he has given, and has deduced                  a
general formula for estimating the differences in magnetic tension
thus detected.
     The author has also examined the influence of bright sunshine on
the suspended needles        ;   and has shewn that the difference observed
in the oscillations of the needle in sunshine and in the shade, may
be made nearly to vanish in the exhausted receiver and he has      ;
rendered      probable, that the slight differences observed in bars
             it
oscillating in the sun's rays,         are not altogether dependent on mag
netism.
   Lastly, the author endeavoured, by an artificial electric aurora in
a luminous conattctor, six feet long and four inches wide, to ascer
tain whether there was any effect produced on        finely suspended
                                                               a
needle, placed within eighteen inches of the conductor         but the ;
oscillations of the needle were not affected by  stream of electricity

                                            a   machine   in this appa
ratus.
     2.    Experiments on Magnetic Intensity made at Liverpool
          and Manchester.  By Dr Traill.
  Dr Traill made   report to the Society of experiments made by
                         a
him in 1832 at Liverpool and Manchester on magnetic intensity,
measured by the oscillations of the horizontal             needles belonging to
the Society, which had been sent to him for that purpose.  The
reporter also stated the result of  series of experiments made
                                               a
by Professor Oersted and himself               in Liverpool in 1823, which     is
important, as having   been made use of by Professor Hansteen in
constructing his isodynamic magnetic lines for Great Britain.
  The result of Dr Traill's experiments is, that Hansteen has esti
mated the magnetic intensity of England        little too high, as Mr
                                                       a
Dunlop found he had that of Scotland     and the reporter concluded
                                                   ;

                                              41
that this arose from the experiments on which Hansteen founded his
calculation being affected by some degree of local attraction, from
the confined spaces in which the experiments were made.
   The magnetic intensity, as deduced from the time of 300 vibra
tions in the reporter's experiments with the Society's needles,                                 is,
with Hansteen's cylindrical needle —
                     At Liverpool, mean of three series = 798\21
                     At Manchester, from one series     = 798 .82
                                                              .
    With Dollond's flat needle—
                     At   Liverpool,   mean of three series         = 1052.83
                     At Manchester, from      one series       .   = 1051.76
    The reporter also stated, that the magnetic dip at Liverpool, as
ascertained by several experiments made there by Lieutenant Allen,
RU. and himself, with needle furnished by the Board of Admi
                                   a
ralty, for the late expedition up the Niger,     = 72°    24".     is           2'
   The experiments on the dip, as well as two other series on mag
netic intensity with    horizontal needle belonging also to the Admi
                             a
ralty, were made on the same spot as those with the Society's needles,
viz. an open space in the Botanic Garden at Liverpool.
    3.   Description and Analysis of Mineral from Faroe, not
                                                       a
         before examined. By Arthur Connell, Esq.
  The mineral in question was put into the author's hands by Mr
Rose, mineral-dealer of this city, as  substance supposed to be
                                                      a                                         a
variety of mesotype.     Mr Rose obtained       from Count Vargas  it
Bedemar of Copenhagen, who had brought       from Faroe.       it
  It has pure white colour, with some opalescence and translucence,
            a
a glistening vitreous lustre, and somewhat greater hardness than fluor.
Its texture imperfectly fibrous but the fibres in some places diverge
                is                          ;
with considerable regularity, shewing an approach to                             a    crystalline
structure.       The specific gravity        is   2.362   ;   it   is   remarkably tough and
difficultly frangible, so as to require much time and labour to                         separate
a mass of    itinto smaller fragments.
    It   gives off water at       a    red heat   ;   and     is   fusible per   se   before the
blow-pipe only on the edges, without any swelling up. With soda                                it
fuses with effervescence into semi-transparent glass with borax and
                                        a                                   ;
salt of phosphorous, gives colourless glasses and, with nitrate of co
                                                               ;
balt, presents no alumina reaction. It gelatinizes readily with muria-
atic acid when reduced to powder.       The analysis was effected by
this reagent. After separating silica, the metallic oxides were thrown
down by ammonia, and the lime by carbonate of ammonia. The

                                        42
 alcalies were separated from one another by chloride of platinum, and
 the water was determined by ignition.          Its composition is as follows :
                   Silica                                67.69
                   Lime                                  26.88
                   Water                                 14.71
                   Soda                                     .44-
                   Potash                                  .28
                   Oxide of Iron      •    -     -    -     .32
                   Oxide of Manganese         -     -      .22
                                                        100.44
    This composition differs from that of all other minerals,           so far as
the author's knowledge         extends;    and shows the substance under
analysis to be a hydrated quatersilicate of lime, conformably to the
formula, 9    S«C   + 16     Aq.
    Sir David Brewster, who possesses        a mass of the mineral     which ho
received from Count Vargas Bedemar,           has observed crystallized faces,
but   so near the general surface, that they cannot be separated.             He
has also found that      it possesses double refraction ; that      it reflects a
bluish light, and consequently transmits a yellowish one ; and that
it possesses no pyroelectricity.        He has no doubt that it is a new
mineral.
    The author proposes to distinguish it by the name of Dysclasite,
 [Svs kXoo)], as expressive of its remarkable tenacity and difficult fran-
gibility. It will, of course, be arranged with the Zeolites.
    The Secretary read an extract from a letter, giving a short descrip
tion of the Stalactitic Caves recently discovered in the county of
Tipperary, and exhibited various illustrative drawings.
    Several additional      specimens were exhibited       from    Burdiehouse
 Quarry ; and Dr Hibbert read a short notice relative to the position
of the limestone there, and the relation it bears to the mountain-
limestone of Muirhouse and the neighbourhood.                  His observations
were to the effect that, by examining some sections of the strata be
tween Burdiehouse and Loanhead, he had now satisfied himself that
the limestone of Burdiehouse lies beneath the great bed of mountain
limestone formerly described by him as traversing the country from
Joppa towards the Pentland Hills!            The order of the strata between
them is as follows     : —Burdiehouse    limestone — shale and thin beds of
the same limestone,      —  sandstone and shale, — sandstone, coal blaes,
ironstone bands, and thin seams of coal — Mountain limestone — lime
stone blaes  — Coal    measures.

The following Communication                was read   :—
    On the Principle of           Vital Attraction and Kepulsion, with
        some    applications to Physiology and Pathology.              By Dr
        Alison.
    The object of this paper was, to state and estimate the scientific
value of a variety of facts, which have been recorded by various
physiologists ; and many of which have been verified by personal
observation, in proof of the proposition,          — That the fluids of living
bodies, or in immediate          contact with them, are in many instances
liable to movements, — dependent on the vitality of those bodies,
but    independent       of any vital     contractions  of their solids, — and
which can hardly be conceived              to be effected  otherwise than by
certain attractions and repulsions, peculiar to the living state.
    Five   classes   of observation, perfectly distinct from one another,
were stated in proof of this general proposition.
    L   The first   are those made on the regular progressive movements
of juices (made visible by whitish globules) in many kinds of vege
tables, to which the name of Rotation has been given in the case of
the cellular plants, such as the Chara and Caulinia, and that of Cyclose
in the    case of cellular plants    with emitting juices, such  as the differ
ent species      of Ficus, — movements which         go on nearly uniformly,
 under    considerable    variations  of  temperature, and of other external
 circumstances, while life continues         ;  and which are not only unat
 tended with any visible contractions of the parietes of the cells or
 vessels containing      the fluid, but are of such a nature, as no contrac
tions    of these     parietes appear capable of producing, as appears
 particularly from the elaborate inquiries of Schultze, Amici, Niebet,
 and Cassini         This conclusion is the more important, as it is pro
 bably applicable to nearly all the movements, peculiar to life, in the

                                          4o
  fluids of vegetables, although       the observations on which it rests can
  be   satisfactorily made on those only which contain opaque globules.
      IL   The second set of facts are those connected with the visible
  currents, which take place in water, in contact with many living
  bodies ; as ascertained, first, By the observations of Dutrochet and
  of Dr Grant on living sponges ; secondly, By those of Dr Sharpey,
  M. Quillot, and M. Raspail, on many aquatic animals, chiefly mol-
  lusca and the larvaj of reptiles ; and, lastly, By those of M. Easpail,
 and of many others, on certain animalcules, chiefly of the genus
  Vorticella. In all these instances, facts seem to be established,
 which are altogether inconsistent with the supposition of the move
 ments depending merely on contractions or vibrations of any living
 solid textures.
     III.  The third class of facts adduced on this subject consists of
 those which show, that, in the fcetal state of animals, different parts
 are successively developed from the semi-fluid         matter of the ovum    ;
 and the particles of that matter must therefore have been much and
 variously    moved     before the heart acts, or any contractile     vessels
 have been formed       ; and farther, that the human ovum itself, during
 the time when      it is surrounded on all sides by the shaggy chorion,
must draw its nourishment          from the semi-fluid   matter contained in
the uterus, through the filaments of the chorion, without the aid of
any contracting       vessels   in  these  filaments.  These points   appear
established by the observations of Prevost            and Dumas,   Breschet,
Velpeau, Baspail, and others.
    rV. The author considers the existence of attractions and repul
sions, peculiar to the living state, among certain of the particles of
the blood of animals, to be established by due consideration of the
following facts :
     1. By the phenomena of the coagulation of healthy blood, and
the utter absence        of any contemporaneous mechanical or chemical
change, adequate      to  explain the change of aggregation of the particles
of the fibrin, on which that process depends.
     2. By the great retardation of that process, when blood (although
its circulation is arrested) is confined within a healthy living texture.
    3.   By the great acceleration of that process, when the living tex
ture, in which blood is contained, is severely injured.
    4. By the total suspension of that process, when death is pro
duced by a sudden and violent cause, especially by a causo which
at the same time destroys the power of contraction after death in
muscular fibres.
                                                                 a 2

                                                46
  5.    By the different modifications of that                  process,   which   are ob
served in inflammation.
  6.    By the phenomena which                  are observed      in those portions of
blood which are extravasated in inflamed parts.
  In    proof of these points, the author refers partly to personal ob
servation, and partly to the works                   of Hunter, Hewson,       Thackrah,
Scudamore,         Prater,     Schraeder    van      der Kolk, Velpeau,        Gendrin,
Eoyer-Collard, and Kaltenbrunner.
   V. The last set of observations adduced in support of the general
principle, are those which, in reference to more complex questions
in physiology, are the most important, viz. those which indicate
                        in the capillary vessels of living animals,
that the blood circulating
and examined by the microscope, exhibit a variety of movements,
and changes of movement, which no visible or conceivable vital
contractions of the heart and arteries are adequate to explain.
  Most of these facts, as to tho capillary circulation, were accurately
described, and the conclusion, which appears inevitable from them,
as to the existence, in the living state, of a peculiar cause of move
ment inherent in tho blood itself, or at least independent of any im
pulse from contracting            solids, was stated and carefully limited by
Haller.     In     regard to the rest, the author refers, not only to per
sonal observations, but chiefly to the authority of Dollinger, Wede-
meyer, and Kaltenbrunner in Germany, and of Quillot and Leuret
in France.
  The analogies which may                            principle which
                                          be traced between the
seems thus established, and other ascertained laws both of living
beings and of inorganic matter ; and the applications which may be
made of     it,
            to the explanation of the more complex phenomena of
the living body in health and disease, were reserved for       future          a
communication.

      1.  Notice of some recent discoveries in Organic Chemistry.
             By William Gregory, M.D.
      The author in this paper communicated to the Society an ac
  count of Creazote, a new organic principle lately discovered by M.
  Reichenbach,      which   possesses    remarkable     antiseptic properties, and
  is the source of the antiseptic        power of wood-smoke, empyreumatic
  pyroligneous vinegar,      and  other empyreumatized substances ; also of
  a very volatile fluid, lately put into his hands by Mr Enderby of
  London, which is obtained by the destructive distillation of caout
  chouc, and possesses in a higher degree than any other menstruum
  the property of dissolving        that substance    ; and lastly, of three new
  crystalline bodies which have lately been discovered by M. Kobi-
  quet, and other French chemists, in opium, and which are named
  Karceine, Meconine, and Codeine.               Specimens of the several sub
  stances were exhibited.
     The author stated, more particularly in regard to the last of these
 principles, that although in common with the two other newly dis
 covered principles        of  opium,     it constitutes an extremely        small
 proportion of that drug, it may be obtained in a tolerably large quan
 tity from the muriate of morphia of commerce, which appears to con
 tain about a thirtieth of codeine.
     From experiments made on various healthy individuals with co
 deine, obtained in this manner, he is led to infer, that in the dose of
 three, four, or five grains, it is distinctly stimulant in its action, and
 to suspect that     it may be in part the       cause  of the disagreeable excit
 ing   effects produced    by opium in      some particular   constitutions.
     2.   On the Structure,          Position, and other particulars of a
            Fossil Tree found in Craigleith Quarry in the month of
            October last. By H. T. Maire Witham, Esq.
     The author describes this fossil        tree as lying at an angle of sixty
 degrees    and   a half, with   its  direction   between S.E. by E. 10°, and
N.W. by W.          10°.   The strata in which it is imbedded dip at an
angle of      20°  towards the S.E,        This tree differs from that which
was found in the same quarry in 1830, in being much less flattened,
indeed      nearly    cylindrical  ;  and this difference appears to be ac
counted for by its almost vertical position, in consequence of which,
the pressure of the surrounding medium would act in an equal degree
all round the      stem.

                                         48
   About fourteen feet of the stem have        been exposed,-and the thickest
part measures three feot in diameter.          The internal structure consists
of uniformly elongated cellules, with medullary rays or plates, and
the concentric circles, if any exist at all, are very indistinct.          In the
transverse section, the woody tissue presents the appearance of a re
gular radiating     series of four-sided      or subhexagonal     colhdes, with
the usual medullary lines intervening.          Two of the walls of the elon
gated cellules, those facing and parallel to the medullary plates, are
regularly reticulated     with two, three, or more        series of contiguous
subhexagonal areolae.
   The areola; in both Peuce and Pitus are separated             and roundish,
whereas in the Piniies they are subhexagonal and continuous.                 This
is the caso with the fossil plant under consideration,              which must
therefore be referred to the last mentioned genus.
   The constituents, according        to an analysis  by Dr Walker, are car
bonate of lime 50-36, carbonate of iron 24'65, carbonate of magnesia
1 7-71, coal, silica, and a little water 6-15.

   1.  Analysis of Coprolites from the Limestone                     of Burdie-
         house.      By Arthur Connell, Esq.
   These coprolites, as well as the limestone where they are found,
contain a trace of animal matter, as ammonia is disengaged at a red
heat.
   Muriatic acid dissolves the greater part with slight effervescence.
Ammonia throws down from the solution a copious gelatinous pre

                                          4fl
cipitate of phosphate of lime        ; and   in the remaining fluid, oxalate of
ammonia throws down oxalate of lime.               The matter left undissolved
by the muriatic acid is inflammable, leaving a small siliceous residue,
and appears to be bituminous matter derived from the matrix.                    There
 is no magnesia, sulphur, nor fluorine.
    The analysis of two coprolites, measuring from two inches to two
inches and a half in length, and containing each a few fish scales,
gave the     following numerical results       : —
        Phosphate of Kmc with    a little oxide of iron,   85 -08       83 '31

        Silica,                                             0-34          0 29

    The proportion of phosphate of lime appears thus to be pretty
uniformly 5-6ths of the whole. The variation in the proportion of
carbonate of lime may probably be influenced by the matrix, from
which also the bituminous matter is derived. The limestone, when
dissolved in muriatic acid, leaves a dark bituminous matter, in the
proportion of 2-5 per cent.
    2.  Notice relative to the Polyzonal Lenses belonging to
       the Commissioners of the Northern Lighthouses.                             By
       Alan Stevenson, Esq.
    These lenses, which were exhibited to the Society by               Mr Steven
son, are three      in number.     One, a plano-convex          lens, two feet six
inches square, was made by M. Soleil at Paris, under the superintend
ence   of the late M. Fresnel.         Another is a double-convex circular
lens of flint-glass, three feet in diameter, which was constructed by the
Messrs Gilbert of London, at the suggestion of Sir David Brewster.
The third is a circular plano-convex lens two feet six inches in
diameter, cast in one piece as originally proposed by Buffon.                    This
lens has been executed for the first time by the Messrs Cookson,
plate-glass makers, Newcastle.
    The author, with the       assistance     of Mr John Adie, jun., made           a
numerous set of observations, to determine the relative value of these
lenses, and     for this purpose ascertained, first, the     mean focal distance
of the central lens, and the several concentric rings of each, compar
ing the results with the focal distance of its           aggregate    surface ; and

                                            no
secondly, the mean diameter of the spectra produced in the focus, hy
the central lens and several zones separately, comparing this result
also   with the spectrum formed by the whole compound                                lens.      The
general results are as        follows : —

  The conclusion at which he arrives                is,
                                           that the Newcastle lens                                is
scarcely inferior to the lens made in Paris and that the Messrs Cook-
                                                       ;
son aro undoubtedly entitled to the merit of having successfully com
bated the difficulties which attend the making of polyzonal lenses in
one piece, — difficulties previously considered insurmountable, but
which they have overcome at the first attempt. The author expects
that some of the particulars of the method by which they effected
their purpose     will    be communicated           to the British Association                    at
their meeting at Edinburgh in September next.
   3.   Additional notice relative to the Fresh-water Limestone
         in the vicinity of Edinburgh, belonging to the Carboni
            ferous Group of Rocks.               By Dr Hibbert
   In   this paper,    Dr Hibbert explained the progress which had                              been
made, since he first pointed out the existence of plants as      well as of
fish    and saurian animals,        in the fresh-water limestone of Burdie-
house, towards     a   farther investigation        of these animal remains.
  The following         representation of the first saurian relic dis
                         is   a
covered in the limestone of Burdiehouse by the author —                          :

                                             51
   The collection of specimens has been subsequently carried on by
the Royal Society of Edinburgh, through their General Secretary
Mr Robison.
   The more important animal relics, which the limestone quarry
has since yielded, are various kinds of fish, some of them referable
to the extinct race of the Palaeoniscus, large scales, evidently Sau
rian, exhibiting a most brilliant lustre, and presenting in remark
able abundance what seem to be the epiphyses of vertebrse, numerous
fragments of bones much broken, and teeth which, in their internal
structure, give evidence of the dentition               that is peculiar to animals
more or less resembling the Crocodile, or Gavial.
                            a                 b                e
  The above figures represent the section of a tooth, obtained by Mr Robison, which
had been accidentally broken In a longitudinal direction.
  a shows the base of the tooth.
  b is the reverse side of the same, in which a small internal cavity may be observed,
       indicative of a newer replacing tooth in an incipient state of growth.
  c Is the larger fragment of the tooth in which the newer tooth of a conoid form
       (protruded from its alveolus) is contained.
  The cavities of the new tooth, and of the intermediate space of the old tooth, arc a
present filled with earthy substance.
   The author then          proceeded      to point out other localities in which
beds of fresh-water limestone crop out.
   At    East Calder, and to the south-west of                Mid Calder, the lime
stone which is there quarried appears, like that of Burdiehouse, to
 have a fresh-water origin.            Its strata have undergone great derange
 ment, and dip in various directions.               In one of the quarries of East

                                        52
 Calder, where a good section is exposed, the lowest rock is said to be
 sandstone, above which the following strata may be enumerated in
 an ascending order:     — A yellowish     coarse limestone, 16 feet   thick ;—
 limestone, 43 feet thick, in which vegetable remains are contained,
 such as are usually found in coal-fields, and, along with these, scales
 of saurian reptiles ; — 9 feet of a very bituminous shale, part of
 which burns readily, mixed with ironstone ; — shale (named Blaes)
 16 feet; — and, at the top of the series, an alluvial covering of clay
 sand, &c., in which large boulders occur.
     Another site, where a fresh-water limestone crops out, is Kirk ton,
 situated a mile or more east of Bathgate.            Very interesting pheno
 mena are here exhibited.           The chemical action under which the
 deposit was elaborated, appears       to have been so powerful as to have
 caused    such miscellaneous earthy matters as are found to enter into
 the composition of an impure limestone, like that of Kirkton, to
 separate    into laminre, and to assume        a sort of striped or ribboned
 disposition,    resembling what the author has occasionally noticed in
 Auvergne, where Tertiary strata have come into contact with vol
 canic rocks.      The strata, for instance, of Kirkton quarry, are com
 posed of distinct and alternating thin laminae, some of them being
of remarkable tenuity, variously consisting either of pure calcareous
 matter, of translucent silex, resembling common flint, or of a mixed
argillaceous substance, approaching porcellanite in its character, or
of ferruginous, or even of bituminous layers          ; and the surface of the
two latter description of laminae has often a sort of blistered appear
ance, as    if from the    effect  of heat    Frequently also, in the purer
limestone, a globularly concretional           structure is observable.     The
whole of the strata of        Kirkton quarry show       a kind of warping or
curvature, which is to be traced no less in small detached specimens
of the rock than in the contortions or wavings which are exhibited
among the strata upon a large scale.*
     All these appearances,     in connection with the remarkable circum
stance,    that greenish-coloured beds of trap-tuff of igneous origin
originally perhaps ejected in the form of a hot tufaceous mud, are
interposed among the strata in divers places, ono of which has ac
quired the thickness         of 9 feet, lead to the      conclusion,   that the
calcareous beds of      Kirkton in their elaboration were in immediate
    *
      This limestono is extensively quarried for burning, and the author     has
understood that, although very impure, it possesses qualities which particu
larly recommend it to the use of the agriculturist.     These are well deserving
of further investigation .

                                          53
contiguity with       some volcanic focus, and that          in their original de
velopment they must have exhibited               the phenomena of hot springs
charged with      earthy matters,  principally calcareous, such as are
familiar to the geologist at the present day, in districts where the
volcanic agency is still in activity.
  From this fresh-water          limestone        the author      collected     several
plants, viz. Ferns, &c. of the same kind as are usually found in the
carboniferous group of rocks.        No remains of fish,          as far as he could
learn, have yet been detected in the deposit, nor, considering                      the
circumstances under which the limestone was formed, could they
perhaps be reasonably expected        ;    but he is inclined to suspect that
relics of some amphibious animal allied                to the tortoise have been
occasionally discovered.
  The upper strata of this deposit             are either alternated   with, or sur
mounted by, hods of argillaceous shale, mixed with seams of iron
stone.     The whole of the strata dip to the west or north by                    west,
and are succeeded,       as far as can be learned         from the covered state
of the ground, by alternating beds of sandstone and shale, which, at
the distance of less than half a mile from Kirkton quarry, underlie
thick limestone beds containing marine shells and corallines. Lastly,
all the beds of this vicinity seem to have been surmounted by masses
of feldspar rock, occasionally columnar.
   The inference to be drawn from these observations                     is,   that the
fresh-water deposit of       Kirkton, like that of Burdiehouse,                 has an
earlier date of origin than the marine limestone of the district, and
that important geological changes, probably of               a   gradual nature, had
contributed     to depress    the lacustrine deposits which had thus been
formed, beneath the level of some subsequent invading ocean.

      1.  On a New Kegister Anemoscope.                  By Dr Traill.
      The author's      object was to obtain an instrument           which might
  register the changes of the wind in the absence           of the observer. For
  this purpose he connected a vane with a vertical axis, at the lower
  end of which the horizontal revolution was changed to a vertical revolu
  tion by bevelled wheels ; and the axis of the vertical wheel carried an
  index and pencil ; which described on a vertical dial of slate, or of
  polished porcelain, all the changes experienced by the vane above.
  In this    manner, however, the instrument             registered    the changes
  occurring     during     only one revolution      of  the vane.      In  order to
  obtain the registration         of a greater variety of changes, — when the
  wind has blown all round the compass more than once, the following
  addition was made : — Each bevelled wheel containing 42 teeth, a
                                "
  pinion of 21 leaves was fitted to the axis of the vertical wheel,
  which pinion plays in the teeth of a smaller wheel with 42 teeth
  also provided with a pinion of 21 leaves.            This last moves a second
 small wheel      of  42    teeth   which again turns round the axis of the
 primary     vertical  wheel.      The  last small wheel moves a second index
 which turns round the dial-plate once, while the vane and primary
 index make four complete revolutions.              The second index carries a
 stud, which moves         in  either direction a pair of hands concentric with
 the   indices,  but  not   attached  to their axis. This stud, then, will carry
 one of the hands through           90 degrees, while the vane has made one
 complete revolution ; or the hands are capable of indicating four
 entire revolutions of the vane.             The face of the instrument has
 three concentric graduations.            The interior is the rhumbs        of the
 mariner's compass       ;  the second has the degrees of a circle ; and the
 outer scale has four series of 360 degrees."                               *
     2.   On the force of the Latin Prefix                ve  or  vae.    By the
            Rev. John Williams.
     The author, after describing shortly the history of the philology
of the Latin language, and alluding to the corruptions which were
introduced into the science during the dark ages, proceeded to show
that the prefix ve or vae must always be regarded either as an adjec
tive signifying small, or an adverb having the force of the Latin
parum or minus.

                                        55
     The term is to    be found,   in the opinion of the author, in most of
  the cognate languages of the great Caucasian branch        of the human
  race, and  still remains in Scotland under its Latin form ve, for the
  Latin V was undoubtedly pronounced like our W, [ve, wee].
     The words explained were the following. Ve-coes, a small heart
 in opposition to largeness of heart, synonymous with wisdom.           Ve-
 SANU8, not sound,      parum   sanus,   insane.  Ve-dius, Pluto, the god
 of darkness, parum dins, not luminous.          Ve-jovis, the small jovis,
parum juvans, not aiding.           Ve-pallida, not pale, parum pallida,
 flushed.    Vescus and Vesculus, having little to eat, parum escce.
 Vb-sbius, the local and ancient name of Vesuvius,          hardly extinct,
 parum <r/3c<rroo-, a name given to it by the Greeks, on their first arri
 val on the Campanian coast, when Ischia, called by them Inarine,
 was the active scene of the volcano.          Ve-sioa, a small sack.   Ve-
 spa, a small  <r<f»i£ in opposition to the hornet. Ve-spera, the period
 when objects become less distinct, — parum spicere, — in opposi
 tion to the morning-star, lucifer.        Ve-stibulum, a small standing-
 place between the street and the house-door, — parum stabidum.
 Ve-stigium, a small impression, a small point, vestigium temporix,
 a point of time.      Ve-grandis, not well grown, parum grandis.
     3. Dr D.  B. Reid exhibited some experiments on the heating
          power of the radiant caloric from the lime-ball light of

     1. Notice of Experiments on the Diminution of Intensity
          sustained by the Sun's Eays in passing through the
          Atmosphere.        By Professor Forbes.
    This subject, though in itself deeply interesting, and leading to
conclusions of much importance for elucidating many obscure ques
tions connected with the constitution of the Universe, has hitherto
received but little attention.        Bouguer attemped to fix the actual
amount of diminution approximatively,            by comparing the moon's
light with that of wax candles at different ascertained elevations ; and

                                      56
 in this way obtained data, from which he inferred, that about       a fifth
 part of the entire rays of the sun is absorbed in traversing the atmo-
  sphere vertically.    Lambert    concluded,    that the loss sustained is
 much greater.     By observing at two altitudes of the sun, the differ
 ence of temperature indicated     by a thermometer in the shade and
 exposed to the sun's rays, and, determining by theory the proportion
 of air traversed at  these altitudes, he inferred the loss at a vertical
 incidence to be -^ths of the whole.        On these slender foundations
 some philosophers have ventured to found most important conclusions
 on various subjects of transcendental speculation ;— such as the tem
 perature of the sun's surface, and the temperature of planetary space.
    Facts, however, of much greater value may be looked for, since the
 invention of Sir John HerschePs actinometer. Proceeding like Lam
 bert on the principle, that the heating and illuminating powers of
 the sun's rays are proportional, this instrument measures the light
 by measuring the heat they produce.        But, avoiding the great defect
 of Lambert's method, viz. the assumption that the stationary condi
 tion of the thermometer is proportioned to the heating cause, a law
 which would only hold, if the cooling influence on the thermometer
were invariable ; Herschel     proposes to ascertain, by an extremely
delicate thermometer, first, the velocity of heating in the sun's rays,
or the number of degrees passed       though in a given short space of
time, and then, secondly,   the rate of cooling in the shade.    The  alge
braic difference of these expresses     the excess of one effect over the
other.    These data   will obviously supply the      means  of measuring
the true intensity of the sun's rays ; since the velocity of changing
temperature is known by Newton's law to be the measure of the pro
ducing cause.
    Having  made these preliminary    explanations, the author proceeded
to observe, that, at the request of    Sir John Herschel,    he had made
some observations    with two instruments       entrusted to him by that
gentleman during his visit to the Continent in 1832.         Twenty series
of observations were made on six different days in Switzerland at
various altitudes, the comparative observations being made by Pro
fessor Kamtz of Halle in the overland of Berne.         The columns of air
varied from 5000 to 7000 feet.      On one day, observations were made
every hour from sun-rise to sun-set.         Every observation indicated
increased radiation at the higher station, and the general diminution
appeared to be not less than £th for the thickness just mentioned,
which is a far greater proportion than was assigned even by Lambert.
    The author found, by an extensive series of experiments made at

                                               57
the    Observatory          of Paris, that, in favourable          circumstances,   the
numerical        estimate of     radiation     by Herschel's instrument may by
relied on to                 of its amount
  2.       On the application of the Microscope to the examination
             of the minute phenomena of chemical action. By the
             Eev. Edward Craig.            Communicated by           Dr D. B. Reid.
  Dr Eeid read                       Edward Craig, of some modes
                         a notice by the Rev.
which he had adopted for examining by the microscope, the pheno
mena of chemical action, by means of which, the most minute changes
of appearance attendant on the contact of the smallest visible quanti
ties of substances maybe observed. The method was described to be:
   1. The laying two or more substances on two thin flat plates of
glass, and bringing them in contact with each other ; so that the whole
matter is spread in one thin level between the two glasses ; and the
several processes of union, decomposition, and crystallization may be
accurately watched in a field of view of -s-5Vir*;n °f an in°b-
  2.       By using longer      glasses which project beyond the port-object,
and applying a          small spirit-lamp underneath, the processes of boiling
and evaporation may be observed
  3.  By using only one glass-plate and a lens of smaller power, so
that it may be raised above the vapours which would rise and con
dense upon        it,   the galvanic battery may be applied, and its effect on
substances seen.
  4.       By laying    a   thin plate of tourmaline on the port-object, beneath
the object to be examined, and            a    similar plate above the object-glass,
crystals may be examined microscopically in polarized light
   These methods of observation seem to present facilities for the
incipiont       processes    of analysis, which may be       a    guide to subsequent
experiments of          a   more measured      kind
      3.   On    a   Register     Barometer         for indicating Maxima and
             Minima.          By Dr Traill.
  The author         gave an account      of   a   new, easy, and economical method
of ascertaining the maximum and minimum of the oscillations of
the barometer during the absence of the observer. It consists of two
tubes, the diagonal and rectangular barometer of the author, fixed in
the same frame.    A piece of thick iron wire     introduced into the
                                                             is
upper part  of the former, and   similar piece into the horizontal arm
                                          a
of the latter.          These pieces of wire are pushed before the mercurial

                                        58
columns, and when the mercury recedes, they remain behind, like the
index in Rutherford's      thermometer.      That in the diagonal barometer
will give the maximum, the wire in the rectangular barometer will
indicate the minimum.           The portions of steel are to be replaced at
the extremities of the mercurial columns, for a fresh observation, by
means of a magnet.        The author has constructed an instrument on
these principles, and found it to work well.

     1.  Remarks on the remains of an Oak dug from a Peat-moss
            near Lanfyne, Ayrshire. By Thomas Brown, Esq.
    The oak described in this paper is believed by the author to have
 fallen into a small isolated lake, which had been subsequently filled
 up by the growth of aquatic plants, so as to form a peat-moss, in
 which the upper part of tho tree has been completely preserved, with
 its bark entire.     The   tree had grown 500 feet above the level of the
 sea.    The trunk     was  48J feet long, without any      appearance   of root.
 As it must therefore have been actually        even longer, and the remains
 of other oaks were found        near,  it must have grown in a wood, pro
bably forming a part of that division of the Caledonian forest, which,
 previous to the 1 4th century, covered Avondale and the upper part
of    Ayrshire. It must have contained 534 feet of measurable
timber.      The author conjectures, that the destruction of the forest
commenced during          the wars of the succession about the year        1 300,
and the contests between Edward I. and            II. and Baliol and Bruce ;
for  a number     of silver pennies of the two Edwards had been found
in the neighbourhood, but no coins of          a later date.    It  is probable
                                                                       B

                                         60
 that these had been deposited by English soldiers soon before the
 battle of Bannockburn       in 1314.
    The author annexed some remarks on the remains of an unde-
 scribed Eoman camp in the neighbourhood ; and on a cairn of stones
 which had formerly been heaped on the spot where the battle between
 Eobort Bruce and Aymer de Valence was fought in 1307.
    Some observations were also made on the small size and present
 neglected state of our oak-woods in Scotland, and on the idea that
 the oak is excellently suited to the moist climate of the west of Scot
 land.
        2.  Analysis of Levyine.            By Arthur Connell, Esq.
    A few years ago, this mineral was described as a new species by
 Sir David Brewster, on account of peculiar optical properties ascer
 tained by himself, and its crystallographic characters, as determined
 by Mr Haidinger.      Berzelius, however, inferred from the analysis of
 a specimen sent to    him by Sir David Brewster, that it is merely a
 variety of chabazite, its chemical constitution appearing to be, Silica
 48, Alumina 20, Lime 8-35, Magnesia 0-4, Potash 0-41, Soda 275,
 Water    19-30.   But,     from   a subsequent     explanation,    it seemed
probable that Berzelius had analyzed not the true levyine, but a
mixture of this and chabazite, constituting the specimen which was
sent,   The author therefore considered it desirable to execute         a new
analysis of the mineral      in question, which he has found to yield the
following results : —
                       Silica,                     46 '33
                       Alumina,     .              22 '47
                       Lime,                        972
                       Soda,                        1-55
                       Potash,                      1-28
                       Oxide of Iron,     .         0-77
                       Oxide of Manganese,          0-19
                       Water,                      19-51
                                                  101-77
    The specific gravity is 2-198, the fundamental crystalline form a
rhomb 79° 29', as stated by Mr Haidinger, while that of chabazite
is 94° 46'.   Sir David Brewster found the crystals to possess one axis
of   double refraction,    like other rhombohedral crystals, while the
optical properties  of  chabazite     are very anomalous.    It is impossible
therefore, to consider the two minerals to be the same, without dis
regarding several marked differences.

          Dr Hibbert.
   The author    gave a summary of the discoveries       which had taken
place during the course of the session relative to the ossiferous beds
of the basins of the Forth and Clyde.         The additional    information
contained in his paper comprised, in the first place, an account of the
older class of strata upon which the carboniferous group of rocks (in
which saurian remains had been found) were supposed, in an uncon
formable position, to rest.      Some of these were referred to a system
of beds,   which geologists consider   as of a newer transition     class, in
termediate to grauwacke schist and coal strata.         Thus, it was found
that a peculiar hard and grey sandstone, containing mica, and occasion
ally alternated with siliceous schist, — which in Shetland succeeds to
clay -slate ; which, near Loch Ness, succeeds to a transition granite ;
and, on the north of the Tay, to grauwacke schist, — was thrown up on
the south of the Forth, near North Berwick,        in the form of immense
severed beds or fragments, showing that this transition-rock          (an im
portant one in the series     of Scottish  strata) is to be regarded as     in
some places fundamental to the coal-measures         of the district.    This
older grey sandstone is also alternated, either with aluminous strata
of the same general character, or with a hard sandstone of a reddish
colour.
   The carboniferous deposits inclosing saurian and other remains,
which rest in an unconformable position upon these strata, were for
merly shown to contain inferior beds of sandstone, shale, and fresh
water limestone, together with very thin seams of coal and ironstone ;
and to be succeeded,    first, by a limestone containing     marine shells,
encrinites, corallines, &c., and afterwards by extensive coal-measures,
which formed the upper beds of the series. This is shown in the fol
lowing general section of the strata connected with the limestone of
Burdiehouse.
                                                              2 B

                                                                               The ESK.
                                               Scale of one English mile.
    In  arguing from these appearances,    tho author considered that, at
the commencement of the Carboniferous epoch, the coal-beds of the
Forth and Clyde did not, agreeably to receivod theories, indicate an
Archipelago of islets, like those of the Pacific, little elevated above
the level of the sea, but, on the contrary, an unbroken                   expanse,
bounded on the north by the elevated ranges of the Grampians, and
on the south by the high ridge of grauwacke schist which runs from
St Abb's Head to the Mull of Galloway         ; and that     while the higher
lands    might   have encouraged the growth of coniferre,              the ferns,
equiseta,    and  other   monocotyledonous      plants     of   our coal-fields,
flourished    amidst marshes,   or on the borders of fresh-water lakes,
tenanted by entomostraca, conchifera, and fish, and to which resorted
various saurian animals.     This land, as had been previously remarked,
 appears   to have undergone      a  depression, probably          of a gradual
nature, by which     it became liable to the inroads of the       sea.     Eventu
ally, however, (as the extensive coal strata lying above the marine
limestone sufficiently indicate), the land became once more elevated
 above the ocean, and again afforded a soil to the Flora of tropical
 climates.
    The author next remarked, that he had found a fresh-water de
 posit, like that of Burdiehouse and Calder, to extend to Fifeshire,
 where it existed as a thinner bed ; and that, in addition to the co-
 prolites and fish discovered more than     a  year ago by Lord Greenock
 and   Mr Trevelyan in the ironstone nodules of Wardie^Mr Robison,

                                         63
General Secretary of the Royal Society, had procured saurian remains
from the coal-field of Greenside near Glasgow, and had discovered
large coprolites     in the shale which is   associated   with the sandstone of
Craigleith quarry.*
    Some remarks were made           upon the remains of saurian animals,
which had       been    more recently obtained for          the Royal Society's
Museum from the quarry of Burdiehouse, chiefly through the exertions
of   Mr Robison, and to which new acquisitions are daily adding.
Among      these,   three distinct kinds seem to have been ascertained.
The larger animal, the author thinks, rather approaches in char
acter to the Steneosaurus of M. St Hilaire ; but he suspects, at the
same time, that such marks of difference exist, as must eventually
authorize the assignment of the Edinburgh aavpos to an entirely new
genus.     The other remains were supposed to resemble most those of
the two kinds of Pterodactyli described by Cuvier.              Bones also which
appear to have belonged to a Trionyx have been discovered.
   Lastly, the author adverted to prior notices of the actual discovery
of saurian remains in the Carboniferous group of rocks. Whitehurst,
who wrote in the year 1778, and Pilkington, in his History of Derby
shire, 1789, have each spoken of the remains of crocodiles and alligators
which had been discovered in the limestone of Ashford in Derbyshire,
from which locality the author has in his possession a specimen of fresh
water limestone, like that of Burdiebouse, containing plants.                 Four
years afterwards, namely, in the year 1793, saurian remains like those
of Burdiehouse, found in a bed above a seam of coal, were actually
figured by the Rev.       Mr Ure in his History of Rutherglen, near Glas
gow, through      he  was not aware of their real character. And very lately
the discovery of a saurian vertebra in the mountain limestone of
Northumberland,          by the Rev. Charles Vernon Harcourt, has been
recorded by Mr Lyell in his " Principles of Geology."
    The author, in concluding, expressed his reluctance to allude to
other occasional notices which had been published, regarding the dis
covery of similar remains on account of their having been mistaken
for those of fish. But, if found necessary, he will complete the
history.

bricated), which will, of course, be described by himself.

   2.   Account of the Dissection of a Young Rorqual, or short
          Whalebone Whale (the Balasna Rostrata of Fabricius) ;
           with a few Observations on the Anatomy of the Foetal
           Mysticetus.  By Dr Knox.
  In    February 1834, a young Whalebone Whale was taken near the
Queensferry,  in the Firth of Forth. After being exhibited for a
short time by the proprietors, it was dissected by the author as care
fully as time and circumstances would permit. The term Rorqual is
employed throughout this memoir in the sense employed hy M.
Cuvier, as designating
                       " Whalebone Whales, with longitudinal folds
under the throat and chest."     He thinks the present specimen quite
                                " Great Rorqual," (the Bakcna boops,
distinct, specifically from tho
jubarte, musculus, &c.), and not as M. Cuvier seems to think                         it,   a
mere variety.   Among other distinctions, the Great Rorqual has 13
dorsal, and 43 lumber, sacral, and caudal vertebras             ;   while the indi
vidual now under consideration has only            11   of the former, and       36 of
the latter. There are, therefore, at least two species of Rorquals in
habiting the North Seas, viz. the Great Rorqual, and the one now
under consideration,  specimen of which was described by Fabricius
                            a
(Baloena   rostrata)   ;   another dissected by Hunter, and         third casually
                                                                    a
observed by James Watson, Esq., who sent                a   drawing of the same to
Dr Traill, by whom   was communicated to
                            it                          Mr Scoresby.
   The author had not leisure to examine the osteology with sufficient
care the following results have, in the meantime, been attained.
    ;
   Internal and External Character. —'Eight distinct bristles, ar
ranged in perpendicular rows, were found in the extremity of the
snout, in both jaws.            The lower part of the mouth      is  a   huge pouch,
which, in the Great Rorqual, must at times contain  vast volume of
                                                                 a
water.   The tongue was free towards the apex and the inside of the
                                                            ;
mouth of    apale rose or vermilion colour.
   The whalebone was about         inches in length, varied from
                                      2\                            pale        a
rose colour to  adull-white, and 614 large external plates were counted.
No vestiges of teeth were found in either jaw; but                  not    it   is
improbable that they exist in the foetus of this species, as well as in
that of the Mysticetus, in the lower jaw of which, lying imbedded
below the gum,     series of teeth was discovered by M. Geoffrey St
                    a
Hilaire several years ago and in which the author of this paper has
                                 ;
since observed themin the upper jaw.
   Brain and Nervous System. — The cranium, besides containing the
brain and its membranes, incloses           a   very large mass of        a   vascular

                                    65
substance, closely resembling an     "  erectile tissue."   This forms an
exception to the hitherto uniformly observed law of coincidence, at
least in the Mammalia, between the configuration of the inner table
of the skull and the contained brain.        The erectile tissue filled a
large proportion of the interior of the cranium, also three-fourths of
the spinal canal, where it surrounded the spinal marrow and nerves ;
being in some places       nearly  2 inches   in thickness.    The whole
cerebral mass, comprising      2 inches  of the spinal chord, weighed
3 \  pounds ;  while the cerebellum, pons, and 2 inches of the chord,
weighed only three-fourths of a pound.
   Respiratory Organs. — The mode of breathing, and the structure
of the nostrils, was precisely as in the Great Eorqual. Two bolster
like substances rilled the nostrils, which are withdrawn from them
at the moment of breathing by muscles provided for that purpose.
There are turbinated      bones in the nose and olfactory nerves, as
large at least as the human.        The author thinks it impossible for
water to be   habitually spouted through the nostrils.     The -Whalebone
Whales have complex nostrils, and smell and breathe precisely as
the higher orders of the Mammalia.
    The Stomach, composed of four compartments, contained no food.
The middle tunic of the ureter was composed of distinct longitudinal
muscular fasciculi
    The author then proceeded to consider at some length, a question
which has lately arisen relative to the structure and functions of the
abdominal glands of the Cetaceae, and which has been six or seven
times before the French Institute in the course of the late and pre
sent session,  — viz. whether these glands are mammiferous        ?  M   St
Hilaire conceives that they are not mammae, and do not secrete milk,
but that they are probably similar to those of the Ornithorhyncus
paradoxus, which he thinks are sexual, specific, and odoriferous, but
not mammiferous.
    The author first observed, that the question ought, in strictness, to
be limited to the Whalebone Whales among the Cetacea ; because
the great group of the Delphinus was proved to be mammiferous long
ago by    Mr Watson, an extract of whose observations is given in
" Scoresby's Greenland." He next stated, that his own observations
left, in his opinion, no doubt whatsoever, that the similarly situated
glands in the Balama rostrata are also true mammae           An elaborate
anatomical examination showed that they resembled the lactiferous
glands of other Mammalia in their structure.        A cursory examination
of the  foetal Mysticetus, led to the same conclusion     in regard to that

                                   GO
 genus ; and the author was farther informed    by a former pupil, Mr
Auld, that in the young Mysticetus     harpooned, he had seen a fluid
of a cream colour and consistence,    and oleaginous taste and smell,
issue abundantly from the mouth ; and, in the full-grown      females,
ho had forced out several pounds of a similar fluid from the orifices
of the glands by pressure of the foot on the abdomen.
   The specimen of Balcena rostrata examined by the author was
9 feet 11 inches   in length, 3 feet from snout to ear, and 4 feet
8 inches in girth at the termination of the plicae and folds.

of two gaseous compounds of phosphorus and hydrogen, — one spon
taneously inflammable, the other not so. Of late, Rose of Berlin has
ascertained that both gases are identical in composition, and has con
sequently been led to infer that the existence of two phosphuretted
hydrogens, differing so much in properties, and yet similarly composed,
constitutes an example of isomerism among gaseous bodies.
   Mr Graham,       however, shows    in his paper that this inference is
not borne out by the facts of the case, — that there are not two phos
phuretted hydrogens, — and that the spontaneous inflammability of
the gas obtained by heating together phosphorus, lime, and water, is
an accidental property, which may be removed by a variety of agents,
without altering the constitution of the gas, and which may also be
restored to such gas, as well as communicated to that which is not
in the first instanco spontaneously inflammable.
   The    agents which exercise the most remarkable power in destroy
ing the property of spontaneous inflammability are, in the first in
stance, various other gases, such as hydrogen, sulphuretted hydrogen,

                                   71
defiant gas, nitric oxide   gas, carbonic    acid, nitrogen, ammonia, or
muriatic acid gas, which, in a proportion varying from a twentieth of
a volume to five volumes, will at once take away the property in ques
tion ; — secondly, certain porous bodies, more especially charcoal ; —
thirdly, various acids, such  as sulphuric, arsenious, phosphorous, and
phosphoric acids; — fourthly, solution of caustic  potass and potassium   ;
—fifthly,   alcohol, ether, naphtha,    and the various essential oils.
These substances produce their effect sometimes in most minute pro
portions, commonly in a very short space of time, and without neces
sarily occasioning any change in the volume of the gas, or any other
alteration whatever, except simply the loss of the property of kindling
spontaneously on its coming in contact with the air.
     The only agent which the author has found to possess the power
of restoring spontaneous inflammability to gas which has been de
prived of that property, by keeping or otherwise, is nitrous acid va
pour.     A large proportion of this vapour has no such effect, but a
small proportion, varying between a thousandth and a ten-thousandth
of the gas, will immediately communicate the property of kindling
spontaneously in the air, even    to the phosphuretted      hydrogen pre
 pared by heating hydrated phosphorous       acid, which  variety of gas is
 well known to be always naturally destitute of this remarkable cha
 racter.
     Gas which has been rendered spontaneously inflammable in this
 way is similarly acted on by keeping, by other gases, by acids, by
 potassium, and by the hydrocarburets,     as the common phosphuretted
 hydrogen, prepared from lime and phosphorus.
     The author concluded his observations by stating, that the analo
 gous action of nitrous acid, and the circumstance that the agents
 which take away the property of inflaming spontaneously are chiefly
 deoxidating substances, would lead to the conjecture that this pro
 perty is owing to the accidental presence of a minute trace of a com
 pound of oxygen and phosphorus not hitherto known, but analogous
 in composition to nitrous acid among the compounds of oxygen and
 nitrogen.    On account of the extremely minute proportion in which
 it exists in the spontaneously inflammable phosphuretted hydrogen
 gas, he was unable to insulate it.    But an important additional rea
 son for believing in its existence appears to the author to be the fact,
 that while the compounds of phosphorus and of nitrogen severally
 with oxygen coincide in composition in other respects, an oxide of
 phosphorus has not yet been discovered which coincides in composi
  tion with nitrous acid among the oxides of nitrogen.

    2. On the    Fossil Fishes of the Limestone of Burdiehouse.
                                By Dr Hibbert
    In this paper the author gave an account of a communication re
ceived by him from M. Agassiz, Professor of Natural History at Neu-
chatel in Switzerland,      relative   to the remains     of fishes   which had
been discovered in the limestone of Burdiehouse,           and which had been
submitted to his examination.           As many of the fish discovered would
be explained in his     "  Recherches sur les Poissons Fossiles," an opi
nion upon a few only was requested.
    The genus found in greatest abundance had been referred                by  Dr
Hibbert   to the Palaeoniscus,     which view was confirmed by       M. Agassiz,
who, in pointing out its distinction        from the Pahconiscus angustus of
Autun, which it      most resembled, regarded it as a new species.          This
very   characteristic  fish  of the  limestono   of  Burdiehouse,    Dr  Hibbert
has named Paloeoniscus Robisoni,          in honour of   Mr  Robison, General
Secretary of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.             Another fossil fish of
a new and extraordinary           genus, received the name of Eurynotus
crenatus.     A third,    which was the first animal relic discovered by
Dr Hibbert in    the quarry of Burdiehouse,        was named, at his request,
 tho Pygopterus     Bucklandi.
    The bony rays, of immense dimensions, and beautifully configu
rated, in the possession of tho Royal Society of Edinburgh, M. Agas
siz refers to a new genus of fish ; and he proposes to name tho indi
vidual to which they belong the Gyracanthus formosus.                  He is also
 inclined to refer to the same individual certain teeth found in another
 locality near Edinburgh.        This genus belongs to his Placoidan order,
 and to the family of Cestraciontes, so named from their approach to
 the Cestracion of New Holland.           With regard to tho alleged Saurian
 character of tho teeth, scales, and some of the large bones discovered
 in the quarry of Burdiehouse, M. Agassiz was induced to consider
 them as Sauroid, rather than exactly Saurian, and to assign them to
 a large sauroid fish, akin to tho extant Lepidosteus.              In the form
 of its teeth, and in a very near resemblance of its scales to those of
 a reptile,  the   Lepidosteus      agrees   with Crocodilian    families.    Nor
 does this general correspondence fail, even with regard to tho inter
 nal structure of the animal.         M. Agassiz    has described the result of
 an investigation of the swimming bladder of a specimen of the Lepi
 dosteus spatula, preserved in spirits, from the dissection of which he
 was enabled to demonstrate not only that it is a real lung, but that
 it even approachos closely to the structure of tho lungs of reptiles,

                                            73
having characters in common with the lungs of salamanders, and of
the reptiles improperly called doubtful reptiles. The lung or swim
ming bladder of the Lepidosteus is not only cellular, but has also a
trachea, which extends the whole length of its anterior surface, and
communicates with a glottis, surrounded by ligaments, intended to
open and shut    constituting an apparatus even more complicated
                    it,
than what   found in many reptiles.
              is                      M. Agassiz also adds, that the
heart has not the appearance of that of a common fish                  ;   it   is   destitute
of the inflation named bulbus aorticus, so characteristic                   of fish, and
hence has much more the aspect               of the heart of     a reptile.
   With this fish, in its well-marked external characters, M. Agassiz
has compared the sauroid relics discovered at Burdiehouse,                           and, in
this inquiry, he has been assisted by the entire head of                  large fos
                                                                           a
sil fish, preserved in the museum of Leeds.                   From the aid thus de
rived, he has been enabled           to establish    a   new genus    under the name
of Megalichthys.           With regard     to the scattered and disjointed              bones
found at Burdiehouse,          it   is   conceived    that they indicate        a     distinct
species, to which         M. Agassiz     has some timo since given the name                 of
Megalichthys       Hibberti.        To the remains of another          species         of the
same genus discovered near Glasgow, and distinguished                       by   a    greater
flatness   of its teeth,    M. Agassiz      is   disposed   to assign the appellation
of Megalichthys       fulcatus.
   In concluding the account of this investigation, Dr Hibbert made
some observations on the importance in geology of selecting for pur
poses of close comparison and analogy, animals subsisting in recent
times, which may be adjudged to bear the nearest affinity to races
long since extinct. In the present instance, the discrimination and
talents of   M. Agassiz had          been enabled to rescue          from obscurity         a
sauroid fish dwelling among the lakes and rivers of the most thermal
regions of America, and to render   elucidative of ono of the earliest
                                             it
statesof our planet, when, in the language of this naturalist, fish
united in their particular organization the character of reptiles be
longing to that class of animals which only appeared                    in far greater
numbers during     later epoch.

    1.  General Remarks on the Coal Formation of the Great
       Valley of the Scottish Lowlands.                   By Major-General
       Lord Greenock.
   In this paper the author stated, that although there is sufficient
evidence    in the mechanical origin and organic contents of the beds
(somo of them of extraordinary thickness and extent) which form the
coal-measures, to prove the pre-existence of much larger tracts of dry
land, in connection with each other, than could possibly have been
afforded by the older portions of the present countries ; such proofs
are altogether wanting when we endeavour to restore,            in imagination,
what might have been the probable extent of that land, the greater
part of which may now lie buried beneath the ocean, or have since
been covered      by more recent deposits.       It appears, however, to have
been clothed with a luxuriant tropical vegetation, and sufficiently
elevated to have given rise to the rivers and torrents, by which the
materials for composing the coal strata had been carried down into
the lakes or estuaries, where to all appearance they were deposited.
   The circumstances in which the large fossil trees are seen imbed

                                       7.',
tied in the strata of    the coal-measures, and other    similar phenomena,
have led the author to suppose,       that these  rivers and their estuaries
may have heen of greater magnitude than would probably have been
the case   if  they had been situated in small islands, according to       the
opinion of many geologists.        The intermixture of terrestrial and ma
rine remains in the same beds, is a strong evidence in favour of their
fluviatile   origin  ; and the fact frequently     observed, of these     beds
being covered      by, or alternating  with, others containing only marine
 remains, may, with great probability, -be referred to changes in the
relative level of the land and sea that may have taken place while
these deposits     were forming.
    In the author's opinion, it is still doubtful whether any beds have
 yet been discovered in this series which may be considered to be ex
clusively of fresh-water      origin, unless an exception should be found
 in the limestone noticed by Mr Murchison at Ponterburg in Shrop
shire.     M. Agassiz     has shown, that neither    the Burdiehouse    lime
 stone, nor any    of the other  beds of the Scottish coal-fields with which
we are at present acquainted, is of that character ; nevertheless the
limestone at Burdiehouse is a very remarkable deposit ; and the dis
coveries of Dr Hibbert with reference to that locality, are of the
highest geological importance.
    The author then proceeded to describe the limits within which the
coal appears to have been deposited in the Scottish Lowlands,         which,
 with  the exceptions pointed out by        him, may, according to Williams,
be indicated by a line drawn from the mouth of the Tay, passing
 through Stirling, to the northern extremity of Arran ; and another
 nearly parallel to it from St Abb's Head on the east coast to Girvan
 on the west.       Although coal may not have been equally distributed
 in every part of this district, — the deposition of the vegetable matter
 from which it was derived, having probably been more or less in
 fluenced by local circumstances, which may also have caused occa
 sional varieties in the mineral structure and organic contents of the
 associated strata, — yet, in the opinion of the author, there are suffi
 cient grounds to justify the conclusion, that the whole series origi
 nally constituted one great formation, the strata of which it is com
 posed appearing to have been deposited continuously, more or less, in
 a horizontal     position at the bottom of the sea, that must then have
 covered at least the whole of that portion of the Lowlands, forming
 either a strait or channel between two islands, or porhaps a vast es
 tuary in which the rivers of the neighbouring primeval countries dis
  charged their waters.       The ripple-marks observable on the surface

                                      7(3
 of most of these beds give much additional probability to this suppo
 sition.
     This original continuity of the      beds  occupying the carboniferous
 district, appears to have been subsequently interrupted by the intru
 sion of the igneous rocks and hills so universally prevalent in that
 formation, by which they have been separated into the fields or basins
 where they are now found. The effects of Plutonic action, by which
 these   hills were produced, seem to have been        the chief agents em
 ployed in modifying     tho extornal surface of this important district,
and occasioning those chemical changes          and combinations in the in-
 terior of the earth, by which, when elevated above the waters, it was
 destined to become a more suitable habitation for tho human race.
     Tho Pentland, Campsie, and Ochil hills, as well as many others
of a similar description within the limits specified, afford striking
examples of the effects produced by their intrusion among the coal
strata, at periods subsequent to the consolidation of the latter, of
 which    some   instances were noticed by tho author.          In   fact, the
whole country occupied by the Scottish coal-measures, displays more
or less the influence of such igneous hills, or of the dykes connected
with them.       A  certain degree of parallelism     may be traced between
tho principal ranges, their general bearing being from the eastward
of north to the westward of south, which corresponds with the gene
ral strike of tho fossiliferous strata ; but they often appear to havo
been protruded through tho surface without           any order or regularity,
and the dykes are found to proceed         in every direction from the prin
cipal masses.
    Tho author farther remarked, that rivers, estuaries, or portions
of the sea, now flow through or cover strata of this coal formation,
which, from the appearances on their opposite shores, were in all pro
bability, once continuous.      The connection between the Lothian coal
fields and that of Fifeshire is very apparent, both in tho general di
rection of the strata, as seon by their outcrop on the opposite shores
of the Frith of Forth, and in the number and thickness of the beds
of coal in each, which exactly correspond.           The appearance of the
carboniferous series in Arran, and at Campbelton in Kintyre, as well
as the indications of its existence at Ballycastlu, and other places on
the Irish coast, within the prolongation of tho lines before adverted
to, seems fully to establish the geological connection in this, as well
as in most other respects, between the west       of Scotland and  the north
east  of Ireland.
    In regard     to tho age of tho Scottish coal-measures as compared

                                       77
with those of England, tho author observed that no formations of a
more    recent date than the coal series have been met with            in the
Scottish Lowlands, for the red sandstones of that district do not ap
pear in any instance to havo been identified with the new red sand
stone    of England.       Professor   Sedgwick and Mr Conybeare have
stated some strong reasons,       which incline him to refer these Scottish
coal-measures to the lower beds of the carboniferous limestone group;
and Mr De la Beche has been led by similar considerations to the
conclusion,   that at tho period when tho carboniferous limestone of
the south of England was produced in the sea, there was probably
dry land in the part of the European area not far to the northward
of the present Tweed, and that a gradual riso of the land was effect
ed, by which      means    terrestrial  vegetation travelled   farther  to the
 south,   so that   its remains became abundantly entombed in that di
 rection, producing the coal now found in southern England and
 Wales, as also in Belgium and northern France, the continuity of
 the whole being superficially      concealed by tho secondary and tertiary
 deposits of those countries.      But, as Mr De la Beche justly observes,
 to trace even the probable extent of dry land over the European area
 at the carboniferous    epoch, would be most difficult, particularly     when
 we recollect   that what we term a geological epoch            may include a
 long series of ages.
 2.   On the composition of the Rangoon Petroleum, with Re
     marks on the composition of Petroleum and Naphtha in
     general.      By William Gregory, M.D., F.R.S.E.
     The author first adverted      to the discovery, nearly about the same
  time, of paraffine by Reichenbach, and of petroline by Dv Christison.
  The former occurred among the products of destructive distillation ;
  the latter was found in the Rangoon petroleum, and they were soon
  found to be identical.       Reichenbach's     researches  on naphtha were
  then   quoted, by which it appears that that indefatigable observer
 could not discover, in the kind of naphtha which he examined, any
  trace either of paraffino, or of any other product of destructive distil
  lation.    On  the contrary,    he found that naphtha to possess the cha
  racters of oil of turpentine, a product of vegetable life ; and he suc
 ceeded in obtaining a precisely similar oil from brown coal by distil
  lation at 212".      These facts had led Reichenbach      to  the conclusion
  that naphtha in general is not a product of destructive distillation,
   and, consequently, must have been separated at a comparatively low

                                        78
temperature.       The author showed that Dr Christison's discovery of
paraffine, of which Dr Reichenbach was necessarily ignorant, is in
consistent with this view ; and detailed some experiments, by which
he   has  rendered highly probable          the   existence   in    petroleum   of
eupion, another of       the  products of destructive      distil'.ation.    This
substance   is a liquid of sp. gr.   0-655, boiling at 110°, and very fra
grant. The author obtained from the Rangoon petroleum a liquid of
sp. gr. 0'744, boiling at 180°, and rather fragrant.               The oil of tur
pentine,  as  is well known,   boils at 280°,   and  has a sp. gr. of 0 860; so
that, at all events, the naphtha from the Rangoon petroleum is not
oil of turpentine.       This was farther proved by the tests of nitric
acid and iodine.      Similar experiments on one or two other species of
naphtha led to similar results.         They all yielded a liquid of sp. gr.
about 760, and, consequently, could not be oil of turpentine.                 The
kinds of naphtha        tried were    Persian naphtha, obtained from Dr
Thomson, and commercial naphtha, sold by M. Robiquet of Paris.
    The author concluded, that if the naphtha examined by Reichen
bach were genuine, there must be at least two kinds of naphtha ; one
a product of destructive distillation, the other the oil of turpentine
of the pine forest of which our        coal-beds   are formed, separated by a
gentle heat, either before or after their conversion into coal.              It is
obvious that our common coal-beds have never yet been exposed to a
heat sufficient lor destructive distillation, since they are destroyed by
a moderate heat, and          wo may     therefore    expect the petroleum of
these coal-beds to    be  of the kind described     by Reichenbach; while the
Rangoon and Persian petroleums, being products of destructive dis
tillation, must have their origin, if in coal-beds at all, in such as have
been exposed     to a high temperature, and must, consequently, be very
different from the ordinary coal-beds.            In confirmation of this view
it  may be stated, that     Dr Christison could find no paraffine either in
the petroleum of St Catharine's,          or in that of Trinidad or Rochdale.
    The author finally directed attention         to the application of the pa
raffine as a material for giving light, as, when pure, it burns with a
clear bright flame, like that of wax, and might doubtless be obtained
at a cheap rate in the East.

 tain hydrates of salts and of acids, had been established by the author
 in the case of the phosphates.          The peculiarity of phosphoric acid
 is its capacity to unite with water as a base in several proportions,
 while all other acids combine with water as a base in one proportion
 only,    so  far as is yet known.    By the author's discoveries in regard
to phosphoric acid, the ordinary conceptions entertained of the consti
 tution of salts were completely deranged.            The salts called biphos-
 phate     of  soda, phosphate    of soda,   and  subphosphate of soda, were
 proved to be all tribasic salts.        The common idea of a super-salt      is
 inapplicable to any of them.
     In   certain salts the author has subsequently found water to exist
  in a different state, not possessed of a true basic function, being re

                                              80
placeable by    a    salt, and not by an alkaline                base.     To develop this
new function    of water, in the        case   of the sulphates,           was the object of
the present communication.               In    that well-known            class of sulphates,
consisting of sulphates of magnesia, zinc, iron, manganese, copper,
uickel, and cobalt, all of which crystallize with either 6ve or seven
atoms of water, one atom proved to be much more strongly attached
to the salt than the other four or six, which last generally may be ex
pelled by a hoat under the boiling point of water, while tho last atom
uniformly requires a heat above 400" Fahrenheit for its expulsion,
and seems to be in a manner essential to the salt.    The constitution
of crystallized sulphate of zinc, for instance, may be expressed thus                                :
                                      SZH + H6.
The   seven atoms of water are here divided into one                         atom, which is
essential to the constitution of the salt, as we know                      it,   and six atoms
which are not so; and to this last quantity the name                         "   water of crys
tallization" may be restricted.   Now, in the double sulphate of zinc
and potash, the single atom of water pertaining to tho sulphate of
zinc  is replaced by an atom of sulphate of potash, and the six atoms
of water of crystallization remain.    Sulphate of magnesia combines
with sulphate of potash after the same manner, and so do all the
other salts of this class. The constitution of the crystallized sulphate
of zinc and potash, which may be taken as the type of this family of
double salts,   is   therefore represented by the following formula                       : —
                                    !3Z(SK);-r H8;
which differs only from the previous formula in having the sign of
sulphate of potash         (SK)    substituted for the sign              (H) of the      essential
atom of water.
   From    a   contemporaneous examination   of the supersulphates, the
conclusion proved to be inevitable that they also are double salts                               ;
that the bisulphate of potash, for instance,    a sulphate of water and
                                                             is
potash, and that its formula           is   as follows   —
                                                         :
                                       SH(SK),
with or without water of crystallization in addition.     There    like                   is
wise  provision in the constitution of hyd rated sulphuric acid for the
      a
production of such         a   doublo salt, as in the case of sulphate of zinc.
Hydratod sulphuric          acid of specific       gravity 1-78 contains two               atoms
of water, and       is   capable   of crystallizing    at    a    temperature       so   high as

                                      81
40- Fahrenheit.      It  is the only known crystallizable   hydrate of sul
phuric acid, and may be represented thus        : —
                                     siiri,
w hich may be compared with the formula for sulphate of zinc, with
out water of crystallization —
                                      szii.
This  second atom   of water present in hydrated sulphuric acid is re
placeable by sulphate of potash, a salt ; and the bisulphate of potash
results from the substitution.       But the first atom of water in the
acid hydrate   can be replaced only by an alkali or true base.         The
function of the first atom is basic, but a new term is required to dis
tinguish the function of the second atom. The application of the
epithet saline to that atom of water may perhaps be permitted, to in
dicate that it stands in the place of a salt. The hydrate of sulphuric
acid in question contains, therefore, an atom of basic, and an atom of
saline water.    It is  "  a sulphate  of water with saline water," as hy
drous sulphate    of zinc is     " a sulphate of zinc with saline water."
The bisulphate of potash is also " a sulphate of water with sulphate
of potash," and corresponds with the sulphate of zinc and potash,
which last is  " a sulphate of zinc with sulphate of potash."
    Sulphuric acid of sp. gr. 1*78 is therefore the primary salt, and
gives the character of the sulphates.       This acid hydrate corresponds
closely with the sulphate of magnesia, which is the reason they do
 not combine together.      Hence there are no acid or supersulphates of
 magnesia, zinc, &C
    Of the two atoms which hydrated sulphate of lime, or gypsum,
 contains, one is expelled at 212° in vacuo ; and the other, which is
 the saline atom is not retained at a higher temperature than 300°.
 Hence sulphate of lime has less disposition to form double sulphates
 than the sulphate of magnesia, &c.

     1.  On the Refraction and Polarization              of Heat.       By
                             Professor Forbes.
   Tho   First    Section of this paper contains an account of a variety
of experiments undertaken with the thermo-multiplier of Nobili and
Melloni, the instrument exclusively employed in the subsequent re
searches.     By a comparison of its sensibility with that of air-thermo
meters, the author concludes that one degree of deviation of the
needle of the multiplier corresponds to an effect indicated by about
one-fiftieth   of a centigrade degree on the others.          Without increas
ing the dimensions of the multiplier, by which its sensibility would
be impaired, he has been enabled, by an optical contrivance, readily
to measure one-tenth       of  one of its degrees, corresponding to one-five-
hundredth     of  -a centigrade    degree.      From  an experiment    intended
to detect the heat    of the lunar rays, concentrated by a polyzonal lens,
thirty-two inches in diameter, and acting upon this instrument, he
concludes that the direct effect of the moon upon an air-thermometer
probably does not amount to one-three hundred thousandth                 part of
a centigrade degree.
   After mentioning his repetition of M. Melloni's experiments upon
the refraction of heat, the author proceeds, in the Seconh Section,
to give an account of his own researches on the action of tourmaline
on heat.      At first  he found (as    it afterwards   appeared     M. Melloni
had done) that no more heat was stopped when the tourmaline plates
had their axes crossed, or transmitted least light, than when they
were parallel,    or transmitted most.        He afterwards   detected a fallacy
in his mode of operation, and proved the polarization             of heat, whe
ther luminous or obscure, by tourmaline.
   The   Third Section       treats of the polarization of heat by refraction

                                       83
and reflection.     The former method the author found by far the most
convenient, employing thin plates of mica, arranged at the polarizing
angle, and through which even dark heat was very freely transmitted.
The results    were so marked that they were verified in a great variety
of ways, and with heat from        sources   extremely different, as that of
an argand lamp, and of water below 200° Fahr.                The polarization
of non-luminous heat by re/lection was also established, though with
much less ease and simplicity.           In this form it was announced by
Berard about twenty years       ago, but hitherto    his experiment does not
appear to have been repeated with success.
    The  Fourth Section       considers the modifications which polarized
heat undergoes by the action      of doubly refracting crystals. The ana
logies here are derived entirely from those of light.         Very numerous
experiments are quoted to show that the effects are quite analogous,
even when the source of heat is water under the boiling point.             The
doubly refracting substance used to depolarize was generally mica.
Out of 157 recorded experiments on depolarization, with three dif
ferent mica plates, only one gave a neutral and one a negative result.
 Yet, of  these 157 experiments,      no less than 92 were made with heat
 unaccompanied by any visible light.          One very striking experiment
is quoted in illustration of the marked nature of the effects. When
the   polarizing and analyzing      plates were situated so as to transmit
least heat to the pile, and a    thin film of mica    was interposed between
the plates in such a position as would depolarize         light under similar
circumstances, the film was found to        stop more heat than it depolar
ised, or the needle moved toward          zero ;  but  if a mica film much
thicker (so much thicker as to stop more than twice as much common
heat as the first) was similarly placed, that film depolarised more
than it stopped, and the needle moved in the opposite direction to the
former one.       The investigation of the laws of depolarization given
in this section are hardly capable of abridgment.
   The following are the general conclusions        : —*
    1. Heat, whether luminous or obscure, is capable of Polarization
          by Tourmaline.
   2.  It  may be polarized by Refraction.
   3.  It  may be polarized by Reflection.
   4.  It may bo depolarized by Doubly Refracting Crystals. Hence —
   5.  It is capable of double refraction, and the two rays are polar
          ized.    When suitably modified, these rays are capable of
          interfering, like those of light.
  * These conclusions were stated nearly in these words (except the 6th) to the
Royal Society on the 5th January.

                                         84
    6. The characteristic law of polarization in the case of light holds
           in that of heat; viz., that the intensities in rectangular po
           sitions of the polarizing and analyzing          plates are comple
           mentary to each other.
   7.  As    a necessary  consequence     of the above, confirmed by expe
           riment, heat is susceptible of circular and elliptic polariza
           tion.
   8.  The undulations of obscure heat are probably longer than those
           of light. A method is pointed out of deducing their length
           numerically.

       Esq.
   Since the author's former communication             to the    Society, he has

a fossil fish which has been designated by M. Agassiz, Gyracanthus

   He has also analyzed       a portion  of the fossil scales embedded          in the
limestone.      These scales belong to a fossil genus of fish, to which the
name of Megalichthys         has been given by M. Agassiz, and which is
supposed to approach in character to the Lepisosteus, or Lepidosteus
of Agassiz.       The  scales were about three-fourths       of  an inch long by
somewhat less in breadth, and possessed a fine lustre, and the usual

   If we   suppose the animal matter to be replaced           partly by siliceous
matter and partly by carbonate of lime, the composition of the recent
and of the fossil bones becomes very similar.
   The ratio of the phosphate of lime to the carbonate of lime in the
Coprolites,   according to the analysis formerly         communicated to the
Society, does not differ much from the proportions in the above ana
lysis of recent fish bones.        The Coprolites may therefore be viewed
as aggregated masses       of fish-bone earth, the animal matter having
decayed    almost without any substitution, from fecal matter not pos
sessing that structure and solidity which seem usually essential to
the proper process of mineralization          by infiltration.       Since his for
mer communication,        the author has found a trace of fluoride of cal
cium in the Coprolites.
   It  is remarkable    that the limestone      matrix   itself contains    a very
decided trace of animal        matter, doubtless derived from the great
quantity of animal remains which           have been entombed in it.

    Dr Traill stated,  as the result   of  a careful  examination of the

arches by the Greeks, that we must abandon all hope of solving
this disputed point,   by a reference to those authors        ; and be in
stanced the danger of inferences from such uncertain data, by com
paring the description of the Treasury of Minyas, given by Pausa-
nias, with the still remaining kindred edifice, the Treasury of the
Atridae at Mycenae.      He also noticed the loose sense in which the
ancient Greeks employed the terms       S»Ao5,        'a^'f-

the Temple      of Apollo Didymaeus, in the territory of Miletus, and
that  of Apollo Delphineus at Athens         ; but he pointed out reasons
why the Greeks never used the arch       as a conspicuous member    of their
architecture, though these examples shew that they were not igno
rant    of the principle of the arch.
   In reviewing the specimens of early Italian art,        he shewed that
the arch was well understood by the ancient Etruscans.             He con
tended, from ancient authorities,        and the peculiarity   of the ma
sonry, that in the Emissary of the Alban Lake, the Cloaca Maxi
ma at Rome, the substructions of the Temple of Tarpeiau Jove, and
probably also in the body      of the Pantheon itself, we have genuine
specimens     of very ancient Etruscan art, in which arches form con
spicuous members;        and he shewed that, in the walls of Cortona,
Fesuhe, and Volterra, in the ruins       of the Theatre of Arezzo, in the
Piscina of Volterra, and in the sepulchres of Perugia and Tarquinii,
we have undoubted and very ancient specimens of Etruscan
arches. In the temples of Egypt we have no examples of any arch,
one of the arches figured      in Belzoni's tenth plate being evidently
Saracenic, and the others a mere hole, with a rounded top, cut in a
wall  ;  but the author exhibited specimens of both round and pointed
arches, lately delineated by     Mr George Hoskins junior, in the        an
cient royal tombs       of Naputa and Meroe, which shew that arches
were perfectly understood by the singular people of ancient Ethiopia.
   The author next shewed that the pointed arch was long employed
in eastern architecture before it was known in western Europe ; a
position which he illustrated by a collection of sketches from va
rious authors.
   He concluded this Essay by some observations on the extraor
dinary architecture of the ancient inhabitants of the table land of
Anahriac, or Mexico, in which arches are distinctly visible ; as may
be seen in the designs of Dupaix, published in the magnificent work
of Aglio ; though the domes in the stupendous tombs of that peo
ple are constructed on the same principle as the Treasury of Atreus
at Mycenae.

  2.     On the application of the Hot Air Blast in the Manufac
          ture of Cast-iron.   By Dr Clark, Aberdeen.
  The author first gives           a general account         of the process of manu
factureof cast-iron previous to the recent improvements, stating
the quantities of the various materials put into the furnace, namely,
of the Ore, the Fuel, and the Flux. He next states the method
suggested first by Mr Neilson of Glasgow, and tried at the Clyde
Iron- Works, for increasing the product of the furnaces with the
same expense  of materials, which consists in previously heating the
air thrown into the furnace, in order to accelerate combustion.
The method is found to produce a vast saving both in the fuel and
the flux, although a certain portion of fuel has, of course, to be sepa
rately consumed for the purpose of heating the air, which is done
by causing it to traverse a recurved                 pipe placed within a suitable
furnace. During the first experiments, in 1830, the air was heated
to 300° Fahrenheit. In 1831, Mr Dixon of the Calder Iron- Works
thought of substituting raw coal for the coke which had hitherto
been employed for fuel, at the same time that the air was still far
ther heated to 600° Fahrenheit, and with complete success.                              The
result    is,   that tpree times as much iron         is   now made      by   the use   of     a
given weight          of           The following are the results of
                        coal as formerly.

 In    1829,    111   tons of iron were produced from 403 of coke, or 888 of coal.

  Dr Clark endeavours to point out the source of advantage thus
obtained, from the enormous quantity of air which  thrown into           is                    a
furnace        in   full action, which      is   not less than six tons weight in              a
minute, and which,             therefore,        must exercise    the most important
influence upon the mean temperature of the furnace.

      1.   The conclusion of Dr Traill's paper on the Ruins of
             Babylon.
     The author, after noticing the ancient writers who have left us
 any description of Babylon, mentioned the short accounts of Ben
jamin of Tudela, of Rauicolf, Pietro della Valle, Pere Emmanuel,
 Niebuhr, and Beauchamp, from which little information is to be de
 rived, compared to what may be gathered from a succession of
 British travellers ; among whom, first in point of time and import
 ance, is Claudius           James Rich, late British consul at Bagdad, whose
 steps     have been successively followed by Kinneir, Ker Porter,
 Buckingham, Keppel, and Mignam.
     He next gave a general description of the ruins, and a more de
 tailed one of the Kasr, the MujeUibah, the Embankment, and the
 Birs Nemroud. The first he considered as the ruins of Nebuchad
 nezzar's palace         ;  the second as belonging              to the palace, or to its
                  "

 hanging gardens     ;                 with the hill of Amran, he
                          the Embankments,
believed to be a part of the defences of the city toward the river :
and the Birs Neraroud, he considered with Rich as the ruins of
the tower of Belus.  He discussed at some length the arguments
advanced by Rennell and Mignan against this latter opinion, chiefly
founded on the account        of Ctesias, that there were two palaces,       one
on each bank    of the river, and that the principal one was on the
western   bank, and that the tower of Bolus was on the opposite side.
Ctesias being the only original writer who mentions two palaces,
and his account not being confirmed by Herodotus, or any other
ancient authority, and the glaring inconsistencies of his narrative in
other respects entitling him to little credit, when he is not confirm
ed by other authors, it was concluded that we had no good reason
to believe that two palaces had existed, far less that the most con
siderable was on the western bank            of the river, especially   as no re
mains, which can at all be regarded as the ruins of a palace, exist
on that side ; while in the Kasr we have remains of a pile, sump
tuous in its material,     of the finest furnace-baked brick, and magni
ficent for its extent, occupying a central position among the con
spicuous ruins on the eastern bank, and enclosed on their sides by
immense embankments, answering to the description left us by
Herodotus of the strong interior wall which surrounded the palace.
  The author next endeavoured to shew, that the Birs Nemroud
answers better than any other         of tlie remains to the description of
the tower     of Belus.
  He next shewed, that the remains of reeds found between the
courses of sun-dried bricks, correspond           to Herodotns's   description
of reeds being used in the lower part of the Babylonian structures,
— Si« TfiTjxerra ifun irXivSov — " for thirty courses of brick," not as
our translators have made         " between every thirtieth course."
                                it,
  Lastly,                   varying accounts of ancient authors with
              he examined the
regard to the extent of the  walls of ancient Babylon, and shewed,
thatif we adopt the least circuit given to them, that of Ctesias and
Diodorus Siculus,   would make the circuit of the city 41 miles,
                     it
while that of Herodotus would give circumference of 55 miles,
                                             a
either of them vastly greater than any idea we can form by com
parison with the largest of modern cities but the author observed,
                                                  :
that there     every reason to believe that the vast area was not
               is
filled with houses, but contained fields and orchards interspersed            ;
which   is   not only probable from what we know          of modem Asiatic

                                           95
cities, but may be inferred from ancient authors, and especially
from some remarks of Aristotle, who states that Babylon was
rather        "
         a community than a city" like the Peloponnesus.      If we
confine the city to the limits assigned by Diodorus, it will not in
clude all the existing remains; whereas the limits assigned by He
rodotus include all those venerable ruins in the vicinity of Hillah,
that still astonish us by their stupendous dimensions.
   2.       On the Expansibility of different kinds of Stone.                                 By-
                  Mr Alex. J. Adie, Civil          Engineer.
  This paper contains the results of an extensive series of experi
ments made upon different kinds of stone, as well as upon iron and
upon brick, porcelain,           and other artificial substances.                 The instru
ment employed was a pyrometer,                of   a simple construction,               capable
of determining           quantities   not greater than           ~^ of         an inch.      The
length       of the substances generally employed was 23 inches.                             The
general result  of these experiments               is,
                                           that the ordinary building
materials of stone expand  but very little differently from cast-iron,
and that, consequently, the mixture of those materials in edifices                              is
not injurious to their durability.            The experiments from which the
            of the substances was numerically determined, were
expansibility
made between the limits of ordinary atmospheric temperature and
that of 212° steam being introduced for that purpose between
                    ;
the double casing          of the instrument.
   The following results were obtained for the fractional expansion

     1.   On the Action of Voltaic  Electricity on Alcohol, Ether,
              and Aqueous Solutions.   By Arthur Connell, Esq.
   The author was led into the following investigations, from ob
serving that when alcohol, holding a minute quantity of pure caus
tic potash, as yJn part, in solution, was acted on by a moderate
voltaic power, as a small battery of fifty pairs of two-inch plates,
evident marks of decomposition were exhibited, by an evolution of
gas from the negative pole, and none from the positive. The ex
periment recalled     to the author's         recollection a statement made a
few years ago by Dr Ritchie (Phil. Trans. 1832), that when alco
hol not holding any substance in solution, was acted on by a pow
erful battery, gas was given off at the negative pole, which Dr Rit
chie stated to be defiant gas.  The author therefore thought, that
the elastic fluid evolved in his experiment might be olefiant gas ;
but on examining it by chlorine, and in the voltaic eudiometer, it
proved to be hydrogen, mixed, when collected from alcohol in con
tact with atmospherical air, with a variable proportion                        of the       con
stituents    of atmospheric air, which had                been dissolved by the li
quid, but quite pure when the alcohol was exposed to the vacuum
of   an air-pump   and then acted on in             a   close tube.       The    same        re
sult was obtained when alcohol of             sp.   gr. .7928 at         66°   F. was       em
ployed as with alcohol of .830.   When the experiment was made on
alcohol containing  Zgj of potash in a small tube, with poles of pla
tinum-foil placed side by side at a short distance from one another,
and seventy pairs of four-inch plates were used, the liquid became
extremely hot, and even boiled, and became gradually reddish                            ;   and
some carbonate     of potash was precipitated               ;    but it was only when
the action was very energetic            that the carbonic acid was formed.
Small quantities     of other soluble substances,                 such    as chloride         of
calcium and boracic acid, produced                the same effect as potash in
causing an evolution      of     gas,   but to a much less extent.                 It       was
then found that    if alcohol,
                             gr. .7928, holding nothing in solution,
                                  sp.
was acted on by 216 pairs of four-inch plates in a small tube with
platinum-foil poles, brought within  j5 or    of an inch of one an
                                                           j'D
other, gas was evolved, as before, from the negative pole, and none
from the positive    and the gas proved to be hydrogen, as before,
                     ;

                                               97
mixed with a small quantity of atmospheric air derived from the
liquid. The alcohol, after the action, was found to contain a mi
nute quantity   of resinous matter.
     The effect of the presence of minute quantities of foreign                          sub
stances     is to increase the conducting power,                as is shewn        by an in
creased action on the galvanometer.                    The alcohol is thus rendered
more easily decomposable.
     The actiou in these            cases   is conceived      to consist in the voltaic
decomposition           of water contained in the alcohol, apparently                       as
a    constituent, when absolute alcohol is acted on                    ;   the hydrogen be
ing evolved at the negative pole, and the oxygen                             being absorbed
by the fluid, conformably               to those instances of absorption             of oxy
gen which are known to occur in the case                      of the acetous fermenta
tion, in that          of an alcoholic solution of potash exposed to the air,
and in other instances.            The formation of carbonic acid during the
voltaic action corresponds to that of acetic and formic acids in the
other instances alluded to, but shews a more powerful oxidation.
  The positive gas could, in certain circumstances, be made to ap
pear in addition to the negative, as, by diluting the alcohol with an
equal bulk of water, or by dissolving T^ of potash in alcohol of
sp. gr. .840     ;   and also by arrangements producing                    certain electrical
effects,    as by reversing          the battery after  it had been sometime in
action, and also by performing                 the experiment in metal vessels in
stead      of those of glass or porcelain.
     When alcohol, sp. gr. .796, holding               a minute         quantity of potash
dissolved, was compared with water holding the same quantity of
potash in solution,               by passing    the of electricity
                                                       same     current
through both solutions, in the arrangement called by Mr Faraday
the Volta-electrometer,              it was found that the         same quantity      of   gas
was evolved from both negative poles, showing                           that in both solu
tions water was the subject of decomposition.                          The conclusion from
the whole        is,   that water,      as such, enters into the constitution               of
alcohol.
   Pure ether, rectified over chloride of calcium, was exposed to
the action of 216 pairs of 4-inch plates, without the slightest
symptom        of decomposition, or action on              a   galvanometer,         consist
ing of     a   single magnetic needle          7    inches long, in the centre         of 30
circuits of insulated copper-wire.                 Neither was     it      decomposed when
it   held corrosive sublimate, chloride               of platinum, or chromic acid,
in solution.           The author therefore concludes, that ether does not
contain water as            a   constituent.
     Assuming          it   to be proved that alcohol         is   a   hydrate, the author

                                                   98
 considers it most probable                  that it   is,
                                                    Liebig supposes, a hydrate
                                                             as
 of ether        ;    but he conceives that the non-action of the pile on ether
 is    unfavourable to Liebig's view, that ether                       is   the oxide of an un
 known radicle,            because   on that view            it   ought to suffer decomposi
 tion.
       The author was farther led to examine                           the evidence        for   Mr
 Faraday's principle           of the definite action of the electric current,                    in
so     far   as regarded      solutions      ;   and found      fully established with re
                                                                  it
spect to water, as was shown                     by   the constant quantity of hydrogen
evolved from various acid, alcaline, and saline solutions.                              He con
ceives, however, that in solutions of the hydracids,                            the acid   is    not
directly decomposed, and that those cases are merely additional in
stances          of the definite decomposition of water.                     This   he found,     by
connecting the diluted acid with the negative side, and water, pure,
or acidulated with sulphuric acid, with the positive                                side, making
the communication             between the liquids by moistened asbestus                      ;    in
which circumstances,              hydrogen         and oxygen          were evolved        at the
two poles, but no chlorine or iodine was drawn towards the positive
side in either liquid         ;   and   it   was only after a long time, when some
of the hydracid itself had passed into the positive liquid, that chlo
rine or iodine appeared in very minute quantity by secondary ac                a
tion. When the battery was reversed, and the hydrogen made posi
tive, the oxygen was no longer evolved, and the chlorine or iodine
appeared immediately as secondary products.  Analogous experi
ments showed that   the decomposition of the haloid salts was a
secondary effect.
  The author found, that when iodic acid was freed from water, by
keeping  fused init tube till water was quite expelled, and then
                             a
acting on         it by the pile in fused state, the galvanometer was de
                                        a
flected      ;   but as the heat of fusion was alone sufficient to decompose
it,   this may not be         a   true      example      of voltaic action, and conse
quently may not be an exception    from the supposed limitation of
electric action to substances composed of like number of atoms of a
their constituents.

   1.  On the Poisonous Properties of Hemlock, and its lately
          discovered alkaloid, Conia.          By Dr Christison.
   The author      commenced      by stating,    that he had repeated    the
greater part    of the analysis of hemlock lately executed by Profes
sor Geiger of Heidelberg, and bad obtained precisely the same re
sults.    According to his analysis, hemlock contains a peculiar prin
ciple, alkaloidal  in its nature, but differing from the previously disco
vered alkaloids in its form, which is that of an oily-like liquid, vo
latile at a moderate elevation of temperature, and capable of being
readily distilled over with water.            It neutralizes acids, without
however      forming crystallizable     salts.   It contains a considerable

                                           103
proportion of     azote.      It quickly    undergoes decomposition when ex
posed to the air, giving out ammonia, and becoming a dark, resin
ous-like substance.
   The discoverer        inferred,    from     a few experiments         chiefly made
on birds, that this principle, which may be termed Conia, from the
genus of plant        whence it is obtained,           possesses     active poisonous
properties   ;  that it produces        coma, convulsions,         and depressed ac
tion or even paralysis         of the heart    ;  and that its poisonous qualities
are  greatly impaired by combination with acids. The author, how
ever, has been led to conclude, from an extensive set of experi
ments on the higher orders of animals, — that the effects                 of Conia on
the body are increased            rather    than diminished         by neutralization
with an acid, such       as   the muriatic      ;  that it does not produce coma
when administered         either free or combined          ;   that it does not act at
all on the heart     ;  that it possesses        a local  irritant action, and that
its remote     action consists simply in the production                 of swiftly in
creasing paralysis of the muscles, ending fatally by asphyxia from
palsy of the muscles of respiration.                  He farther found it to be a
poison of exceeding activity, scarcely inferior indeed in that respect
to hydrocyanic acid.           Two drops applied to a wound, or introduced
into the eye of a dog, rabbit, or cat,             will sometimes occasion death
in  ninety seconds     ;   and   the same      quantity injected in the form of
muriate into the femoral vein           of   a  dog killed it in three seconds at
farthest.    The author added various reasons for doubting the pro
bability of any chemical antidote being discovered; and suggested
artificial respiration as the most probable remedy, founding on an
experiment in which the heart was maintained in a state of vigo
rous action for a long time by artificially inflating the lungs.
   An abstract was then given of a               set of comparative experiments
made with extract of hemlock             ; from which he inferred that the ac
tion of hemlock is identical with that of Conia.                   Very powerful ex
tracts were used, which had been prepared with absolute alcohol
from the leaves or seeds.             The effects ascribed by some toxicolo-
gical authors to hemlock were not observed                   ;  but simply paralysis,
with intermittent slight convulsions.                From this identity of action
it may be concluded, that Conia is really the active principle of
hemlock, or at least contains it in large quantity, and is not the
product    of chemical action and new arrangements of elements.
   Some remarks were appended as to the probable nature of the
State-poison nsed in ancient times, particularly in Athens, for de
spatching criminals       ;  which has commonly been held to be a prepa

                                       104
 ration of the same plant with the modern Conium maculatum. The
 author shewed, from the descriptions of the Greek xnnut and Ro
 man cicuta,     that this plant could not be the modern conium        ; that
 the account given by Plato of the effects       of the state-poison in the
 case   of Socrates is wholly    at variance with the description by Ni-
 cander and others        of the action of the xuwm ; that the effects
ascribed to the poison in Plato's narrative are such as no poison
 whatever which is known at present can produce           ;  and that conse
 quently either     Plato's description   is an embellished    narrative, or
the ancients were familiar with a poison of most remarkable and
peculiar properties, with which modern toxicologists are no longer
acquainted.

     1.  Notes on the Geology of Auvergne, particularly in con
            nection with the Origin of Trap-Rocks and the Eleva
            tion Theory.       By Professor Forbes.      Concluded.
    The first part of this paper (which accompanied a series of geo
 logical specimens from Auvergne, presented to the Society) relates
 to several specific points which tend to assimilate the evidence for
 the igneous origin of trap-rocks generally, with that afforded by
 the volcanic     district of Central France.      The altered character of
 the stratified deposits with which         igneous rocks have been   inter
 mixed, is one of their most striking features ; yet we occasionally
 find cases where this evidence is far from being so obvious as
 might be expected        ; and this dubious character, which is particu
 larly remarked       in the hill of Gergovia, near Clermont, forms an
 admirable parallel to some cases in trap districts where a like want
of alteration occurs.
    The mineral character of the rocks of Auvergne admits of al
most perfect identification in a majority of cases with that of un
doubted trap-rocks        ; and we may employ the formations     of Central
France     as a medium       of comparison between trap-rocks generally,
and modern         volcanos, from    which the formations of the Monts
Dome are undistinguishable.            The trachytes of the Mont Dor and
Cantal find their counterparts in the districts of the Siebengebirge
and Laacher-Lee.            Varions points of structure were noticed as
important, especially the columnar forms of lavas, geologically

                                    106
speaking, modern, which has been often referred to        ;  and more re
markably     the union    of the tabular, with the polygonal columnar
structure, exhibited     in the undoubtedly igneous trachytes, basalts,
and phonolites of the Mont Dor, which are sometimes so exten
sively slaty as almost to assume the appearance       of stratified rocks.
The very remarkable passage of one rock into another differing in
mineral    character   and structure was also pointed     out, and hence
the difficulty  of pronouncing conclusively upon the relative       age  of
such rocks.
   The second part of the paper referred to Von Buch's Theory of
Elevation-Craters, and professed to give simply the impression
made upon the author's mind by an examination              of the specific
cases  of the groups of the Cantal and Mont Dor, which have been
quoted as examples in support of that theory.       Various views of the
subject were presented, from which the author is disposed to con
clude decidedly in favour of the Elevation Theory in these particular
cases.    The arguments were drawn         chiefly from   the forms    and
magnitude     of the valleys, and the relation of the beds of igneous
rock to one another, in which the valleys are formed.          The author
expresses some doubt as to the utility of the calculations entered
into with regard     to this question by   MM. Elie    de Beaumont and
Dufrenoy, and especially as regards the complicated system of the
Mont Dor, of which he considers it almost hopeless to unravel the
manifold    revolutions.    In general, however, he coincides jin the
conclusions arrived at by those authors.
   2. Notice    of a New Compound of Sulphur, which is probably
         a  Sulphuret of Nitrogen.       By Dr Gregory.
   This substance, obtained among the products of the reaction of
chloride of sulphur on a solution of ammonia, is a solid, colourless,
insoluble in water, soluble in alcohol, crystallizing in cubes.       It is
characterized by producing a fine, but fugitive purple colour, when
brought into contact with potash and alcohol.
   Dr Gregory obtained from it between 92 and 93 per cent, of sul
phur, and from 6 to 7 per cent, of nitrogen.
   3. On another New Compound            of Sulphur, analogous to the
          Mercaptan of Zeise.       By the same.
   The remarkable substance termed by its discoverer, Mercaptan,

                                     107
may be viewed as alcohol, the oxygen of which has been replaced
by sulphur, as in the following formula; :
        C4 H6 02 = Alcohol.            C4 H8      S4 = Mercaptan.
The pyroxylic spirit of Dumas and Peligot being extremely analo
gous to alcohol,    Dr Gregory examined whether this analogy ex
tended to the production      of  a compound     analogous to Mercaptan      ;
and, by substituting pyroxylic spirit for alcohol, he obtained this
compound, which, although in most         of its properties closely resem
bling mercaptan,     is distinguished   from it by    a greater   degree of
volatility, boiling at 70° F., while mercaptan boils at 185° F. The
following formulae exhibit the composition of the pyroxylic spirit,
according to Dumas and Peligot, and the probable composition of
the new liquid    :
     C4 H4 02 = Pyroxylic Spirit.           C2 H4         = New Liquid.
The new liquid has, like mercaptan, a most insupportable alliaceous
odour, and exercises an action on red oxide of mercury similar to
that from which the name Mercaptan          is derived.
    4. On   a  curious Phenomenon observed in the Island of Ce-
         phalonia, and on the proximate cause of Earthquakes in
         the Ionian Islands.      By Dr John Davy. Communicated
         in a letter to Professor Forbes.
   Dr Davy communicates the description of certain streams of            sea-
 water which     appear to be constantly flowing into the interior of
 the earth, by four openings, near the town of Aigostoli, in Cepha-
lonia.   These are now applied as sources of mechanical power. Dr
Davy views this curious fact        as probably related     to the very re
markable     local earthquakes    which   affect the Ionian    Islands, and
which appear to be disconnected with any volcanic appearances, or
even the occurrence of trap-rocks.         Dr Davy conceives that      these
phenomena may be attributable         to the absorption    of this quantity
of sea-water constantly received into the land by the marly beds
which occur in Cephalonia.        This absorption, Dr Davy concludes
from direct experiment, may produce an enlargement of the vo
lume of the marl.      This supposition is supported by the remarkable
fact, that, in the Ionian Islands generally, these earthquakes occur
entirely in the low and marly parts of those islands, and never in
those parts connected with solid rock.

     1.  Some Observations on Atmospherical Electricity.          By Dr
           John Davy, F. R.     S.   Communicated by Professor      For
           bes.
    This paper, tending to establish the chemical action of atmospherical
electricity, is based upon experiments made in Malta between Octo
ber 1834 and March 1835. The mode of operating was the follow
ing : A tube of glass containing a wire of copper was elevated six
feet in all above a turret in   Dr Davys house in Valletta, which rose
just fifty feet from the street. It was not in the highest part of the
 town, and was overtopped by other buildings.*" To the lower part
 of the copper- wire was attached one of gold. The communication
 to the ground was effected through the medium of another' copper-
 wire, connected with a leaden cistern.        Between these two por
 tions of the line of communication from the sky to the ground was
 interposed the decomposing apparatus, consisting of a tube contain
 ing iodide of potassium mixed with starch, and into which two pla
 tinum wires were inserted, until within one-fourth inch of being in
  contact.    It was found that, with this arrangement,     decomposition
  was generally     going forward even in fine weather, —that it in
  creased in windy or cloudy weather, and especially]during the con
  tinuance    of the sirocco or S. E. wind. During thunder storms,
  showers of hail, and also of rain, the effect was notably increased.
      A deposition of iodine was frequently observed on both wires,
  which    Dr Davy attributes to successive changes in the electrical
  state of the passing clouds.      Dr Davy was only once able to ob
  tain distinct indications of the decomposition of water ; in that case
  a strong solution    of salt was employed,    and fine sewing    needles
  coated with sealing-wax,     except at the points, were used as con

                                    109
ductors.     That  these effects were not    owing to any electro-chemi
cal action at the junction of the copper and gold conductors was
proved by substituting     gold throughout.
    Dr Davy very rarely succeeded in affecting         a galvanometer     by
atmospheric electricity    ; nor did he succeed in changing the colour
of chloride    of silver by the light of the most brilliant thunder
storms, as    Mr  Brande is believed to have done by voltaic electri
city.
    On the whole, Dr Davy coincides with Mr Faraday in consider
ing atmospheric electricity as intermediate in its nature between
common electricity and that      of the pile.
    2.  Essay towards establishing the Primary Properties of Pa
          rallel Lines.    By Mr W. Nichol.
    The object of the author in this paper was to find a new method
of avoiding Euclid's assumptions in the theory of parallel lines.
 This he endeavours to do by proving that lines making equal angles
 with a given line cannot recede from one another         ;   but he does not
 effect this without the introduction of the consideration of infinitely
 Bmall spaces.

The following Communications were read                 :
   1.    On the Mathematical       Form of the Gothic Pendant.             By-
              Professor Forbes.
  The author          commenced, by stating the general proofs of the
knowledge         of the principles of equilibrium displayed by Gothic
architects in the structures (especially) of the pointed style. The
adaptation of their edifices was to the combined ends of elegance
and strength     The extension of this principle to the case of the
Gothic pendant is the chief object of this paper.      Sufficiency in
point of strength, without redundancy of material, is considered by
the author as the primary source of architectural beauty ; which he
has demonstrated to be the case when the depending Gothic drop
is generated by the revolution of the logarithmic curve round its
axis.  The condition of maintenance of a depending body              is,
                                                                  that
the increment of the section may be in         constant ratio to the
                                                  a

                                          112
   increment of weight of the body to be sustained.              This  is shown to
   be attained     in the  case  of  bare support, when the modulus          of the
   logarithmic     curve is equal to twice the modulus of cohesion of the
   substance    of which the pendant is composed,         in  feet.   Under these
   circumstances,     the depending     mass would    be   just  within   the limit
   of disruption, but its strength would be uniform throughout, and the
  tendency to separation would at no one point be greater than at
  another.    It  is not imagined that the Gothic architects could have had
  a  mathematical knowledge of a curve, which was not attained                   till
  long after, but the degree of tact by which the eye is guided in the
  selection and adaptation of symmetrical forms seems quite capable
  of explaining such an approximation to theory, which, it is believed,
  has not before been        noticed.    Thus,  a  depending cylinder appears
  overloaded at its inferior extremity, a cone towards its middle, and
  so of  all figures which    are not concave    outwardly.
      2. On the occurrence of the Megalichthys Hibberti in a bed
            of Cannel Coal in the west of Fifeshire ; with Observa
            tions on the supposed Lacustrine Limestone of Burdie-
            house.      By Leonard Horner, Esq., F.R.SS.             L  & E., and
            F.G.S.
      In a fragment of this kind of coal there was accidentally found              a
 very fine specimen of       a  tooth, which the author considers to belong
 to the Megalichthys        Hibberti of Agassiz.       It   is similar to some of
 those found       in the limestone of Burdiehouse by Dr Hibbert, and is
 almost idcntical'with that figured at p. 183 in Dr Hibbert's Memoir,
 in the 13th volume of the Society's Transactions; being about two
inches long, and seven-eights of an inch at the base, longitudinally
striated, and covered with a shining enamel.
     The coal in which         it was found was brought from Halbeath,
about two        miles eastward of      Dunfermline        It  forms one of the
regular coal-measures,       being associated   with sandstones,     shales, clays,
and beds of coal of ordinary qualities           ; the shells abounding       with
impressions of plants.          The strata  are subject to great disturbances
there being five faults         in the  space  of half  a mile.      There are no
trap-dykes, but there is an overlying mass of trap, which the author
believes to be connected with a deep-seated dyke ; and it is pro
bably to the intrusion of this igneous rock that the disturbances in
the stratification are to be ascribed.
     The occurrence of remains of the same sauroid fish that is found

                                       113
 in the limestone at Burdiehouse       leads the author to inquire, whether
there be     any analogy between the two deposits : he thinks they
are   similar; not, however, that he believes there is a fresh-water
formation at Halbeath, but because he is of opinion that there is no
ground for considering that such a formation exists at Burdiehouse,
or that the strata there offer any exception to the usual phenomena
presented by coal formations      ;   that the bed of limestone is not, as
Dr Hibbert maintains, of lacustrine origin, but presents only such
characters as may be sufficiently accounted for on the supposition
of the coal-measures having been deposited in an estuary, which
is now the commonly         received     theory of    the   formation   of coal
deposits   in general.
    Dr Hibbert rests its lacustrine character on the absence of marine
shells; and, in connection with that circumstance, on the abun
dance of land plants ; the presence of what he conceives to be fresh
water fishes ; and a great profusion of the shells of what he calls
a Cypris, one     of those microscopic          entomostraca which inhabit
fresh water.
    The author, on the other hand, maintains that the absence of
marine shells is no proof, because it constantly happens that we find
beds of limestone in which not a trace of an organized body can be
found, alternating with others nearly wholly composed of them.
That the same genera, and many of the same species of plants, are
found throughout       the whole of the carboniferous         series, from the
Old Eed to the New Red Sandstone            ; that there is no ground for con
sidering any of the fishes to have belonged to fresh water; but that,
on the contrary, they are met with in the zechstein of Germany
and the magnesian limestone of England, and frequently                 in other
regular coal-formations ; and       that   the shells    of entomostraca are
by no means a conclusive proof, as the shell of the Cytherina, which
lives in sea water, cannot be distinguished from that of the Cypris.
    3.  Professor Forbes verbally communicated to the Meeting
          that he had succeeded in proving the Circular Polariza
          tion of Heat, whether accompanied or unaccompanied by-
          Light; when polarized heat is made to undergo two
          total reflections within a rhomb of rock-salt, the plane of
          total reflection being inclined 45° to the plane of primi
          tive polarization.

  The award of the Keith Prize to Professor                     Forbes having been

  The prize      founded by our           late estimable associate,         Mr Keith,
whose    ingenious       contrivances       for   self-registering       thermometers
and barometers are recorded in our Transactions,                   is,   by the regula
tion of his Trustees, to be adjudged biennially for the most import
ant discovery communicated to the Royal Society, or in the event
of such being wanting,            for the best paper which shall have been
presented to the Society in the space of two years on                       a   scientific
                         •
                              Printed by order of the Council.

                                       115
subject.    The Council, in discharge of the powers          vested    in them,
have awarded unanimously          the   Keith prize for the last biennial
period, to Professor Forbes, for his paper " On the Refraction and
Polarization   of Heat," which they consider to       come under that class
of communications       which contain discoveries important to          science.
    The Vice-President     then observed, that the subject of heat is one
so important     to man,    and so intimately connected with a variety
of natural phenomena, that it has not failed to command no small
degree   of attention    in all ages.   That an intimate connection sub
sists between Heat and       Light, and that much discordance of opinion
has subsisted respecting the nature of both.            He next     Stated   the
various   opinions    entertained    concerning    them,   and    particularly
respecting heat, and in historic order presented the views of Bacon,
Boyle, Boerhaave, Stahl, and Black, and adverted to the discoveries
of Black respecting latent and specific           heat, and the successive
labours of Irvine,      Crawfurd,   Wilke, Magellan,     Lavoisier     and La
place, Dulong and Petit, in the       same field.
   Heat    presents itself in two        different  conditions]    first   when
combined with matter, pervading bodies slowly, either by communi
cation and conduction       through    and among its particles, or by the
movements of the particles themselves;            secondly, when radiated,
moving through elastic fluids or empty space with vast velocity.
   The first of   these   had been studied by the philosophers already
named,   and not long after by Eumford.            To the   second    of these,
viz. radiant   heat, the subject    of Professor Forbes's discovery called
upon him more especially to allude, and to present a brief historic
view.
   The radiation of cold, and its reflection by metallic mirrors,            was
known    to Baptist,! Porta in the sixteenth         century  ; and observa
tions were made on the radiation of heat, by the Florentine acade
micians, towards the middle of the seventeenth century, and by
Marriotte   in  1682.     About the middle of the eighteenth century,
Lambert published his works on pyrometry and photometry, which
contained some of the first accurate         experiments on this subject;
and the facts of the difficult transmission and reflection of heat by
glass, was pointed    out by the Swedish chemist Scheele.             Pictet of

                                           116
 Geneva extended his experiments on the radiation and the reflection
 of the heat derived from boiling water, and our venerable associate
 Professor Prevost of the same place, established the doctrine of the
 mobile equilibrium        of heat, in    1802.     The triumph of this theory
 was found in the beautiful            experiments    of  Dr Wells, on dew, in
 1813.
    Meanwhile,       the experiments       of   Rumford and Leslie were cor
roborating     and extending       these    general views, even although       the
doctrines of radiation were denied by the latter philosopher                 in all
his writings.       The   passage of radiant heat through solid substances,
such    as  glass,  and through       fluids, such as water, had       long   been
admitted, in the case where light accompanied heat.                   But in the
 case of non-luminous        heat, it was strenuously denied by Leslie and
others.     The experiments of De la Roche proved that such was the
fact, at least in the case of heat derived from terrestrial sources, and
at the same       time luminous.         But this subject has received      a vast
enlargement by the recent experiments of Melloni, who has shown
that substances differ surprisingly in their permeability to heat, and
that while some,        such as     alum, stop almost       every incident ray,
others, as rock-salt, transmit almost the whole of the heat, and that
from whatever source derived.
    The connection of light with heat,           was too obvious and important
to be overlooked.         To Sir W. Herschel the world is indebted for
the   first  great step      in this curious inquiry.         He examined      the
thermometric       qualities of the spectrum formed from the sun's rays
by   a common prism of glass           ; and in 1800 announced the curious
fact, that the heating power increases, not only from the violet to
the red end of the spectrum, but              even beyond  the latter, indicating
the existence of dark calorific rays.             These experiments, though at
first denied by some authors, were afterwards              fully confirmed, and
some     anomalies      which they presented, explained,            by Robison,
Englefield,    Berard, Seebeck, and Melloni.
   Heat, then, even       unaccompanied by light, appears         to be capable
both of reflection and refraction.             But new modifications     of light'
discovered     of late     years,  require us to investigate       how far     the
analogy may        be   pursued.     In 1802, Dr Young announced his

                                                117
remarkable discovery of the interference of the rays of light, or the
power of two luminous rays, properly disposed, to produce darkness
by their union.          About the year 1808, Malus,                     a most     eminent
 French        philosopher    and mathematician, discovered the remarkable
modification which light undergoes by reflection from certain sub
stances       at certain angles.        This modification            may be easiest     con
ceived by stating the fact, that light so reflected                     becomes incapable
of undergoing a second reflection in certain positions of the reflect
ing surface, when common light would be reflected.
     The corresponding experiment in the                      case   of heat was tried by
Berard, along with Malus, about the year 1811, and an account of
them         was published     in 1817, in the Memoires aVArcvsil,                     They
found, that when the solar beam was twice reflected in the manner
just    stated, the heat and         light refused simultaneously to            be reflected
in certain positions of the            second    reflector.      The    same experiment
was repeated         with incandescent bodies, with the                 same result ; and
even, as stated by Berard,            with bodies having temperatures beneath
that of visible        incandescence.           These experiments were probably
discontinued in consequence             of the death of Malus, and the details
were never published,          if,   indeed, they were ever carried to any great
extent.        The result has        been,   that Berard's conclusion            seems not
to have been generally adopted by the scientific world.                        The polariz
ation of heat has remained amongst the doubtful facts in science.
It     has    been adopted      in scarcely any systematic works, whether
British or foreign      :    and, of late years, direct evidence seemed to be
entirely       against it.    Professor      Powell of Oxford,            repeatedly and
fruitlessly, attempted to obtain Berard's result                      Nobili of Florence
(whose recent loss science has to deplore) attempted
                                                                         it   likewise with
the aid       of his thermo-multiplier,         an instrument          admirably adapted
for the measurement of small quantities of heat                  ;    and Melloni having
failed to polarize even luminous heat by tourmalines, concurs in the
conclusions of Powell and Nobili.                The Vice-President then observed
that    it   was under these circumstances that the subject was under
taken by Professor Forbes, who, by means of arrangements differing
from any that had before been used, has succeeded                          in completely
establishing       the polarization of heat under all the circumstances in

                                         118
which light is polarized, namely, by Reflection, Transmission, and
Double Refraction, and that it is for tho establishment of             these facts
that the   Keith Prize has      been awarded    by the Council.
    Dr Hope then       stated that,  in the ordinary     case  of the publication
of papers, the Society holds itself in no degree responsible for the
truth of the facts      stated therein ; but,   in the adjudication of      prizes,
the case is different     ;  and that, with regard to them, the Council are
bound     to be satisfied of the truth of the statements for which they
award their prize.          Several members of the Council          had seen and
satisfied themselves of tho accuracy of           Mr Forbes's leading experi
ments before the        Keith Prize was awarded       ;  and, some days ago, he
deemed     it right to request Mr Forbes           to show him the more im
portant of these       experimental     demonstrations.       This he   succeeded
in doing in    a  way which left upon his mind not the slightest doubt
as to the    truth of his results     ;  the variations    of temperature being
so obviously     displayed, as to prevent the slightest ambiguity            as  to
the true     source     from which they are derived.             The instrument
employed in the research is the thermo-multiplier,                  of which the
invention is due to Nobili, though it has been greatly improved                 for
experimental      purposes by Melloni.        Professor Forbes has likewise
increased greatly its power of indicating the more delicate effects by
employing      a telescopic apparatus,      which enables him to        measure    a
quantity of heat, perhaps not exceeding one fifteen-hundredth                  part
of  a degree of Fahrenheit.
    That the Society may fully understand the nature of the proofs
afforded by     Mr Forbes's experiments, reference must            be made to the
 correlative facts observed in the case of light.
    When light undergoes reflection from              glass  at an angle of 56°,
its physical character is found to be thus far altered, that it refuses
to be a second        time reflected by another plate of glass placed to
receive the ray at the same angle of 56°,            if  the plane of incidence
 on the second      glass   be perpendicular     to the plane of incidence on
the first.    The light is then wholly transmitted by the second plate.
 If  the plane of incidence be tho same for the two plates, complete
 reflection takes place at the second        plate.     This illustrates polariza
 tion by reflection.

                                         119
    If a number    of  glass plates be used, and      light transmitted obliquely
through such      a  bundle of plates, it is in like manner found, that the
emergent light is wholly transmitted               by    a second      similar bundle
placed parallel       to the first,     but   is almost wholly reflected,           and
therefore not transmitted, when the second                bundle is placed so that
whilst the ray falls upon it at the           same angle as upon the first, the
plane of incidence on the second           bundle being perpendicular to the
plane of incidence upon the first bundle.                 This is polarization by
 transmission or refraction.
    Lastly,  It  was observed before the close of the 17th century by
 Huyghens, that certain bodies, as Iceland                spar, endowed with the
 property of double refraction, alter at the same time the character
 of the light in the two refracted rays.                 So that,     if two sections
 similarly   cut   from a crystal of        Iceland     spar be placed upon one
 another in conformable positions, or the respective positions which
 they occupied on the crystal, the two rays             will  proceed     through the
 second slice as they      did through the first, and        be refracted according
to the same laws.         But   if the second slice be placed unconformably
upon the first, or turned round a quarter of a circle, the ray, which
 at first  was   ordinarily refracted, is now extraordinarily                refracted ;
 and the ray, which at first was extraordinarily,                 is now ordinarily
 refracted.     Now, it      has   been  found     that    some     crystals, such as
 tourmaline,    possess     the property, first, of dividing these rays, and
 then  of suppressing or absorbing        one   of them   ; the result of which is
 that when two tourmalines,            cut as we have supposed,             are placed
 conformably, the ray which was not suppressed by the first slice,
 still makes its way through the second              ;   but, when placed uncon
formably, the ray transmitted by the first plate is wholly suppressed
by the second.         In the latter   case, therefore, not a ray of          light can
 penetrate the two plates.          This is polarization produced by double
 refraction.
    Now, all     these    modes of     polarization     have been recognised by
 Mr Forbes in the        case of heat, and even in the case of heat              wholly
 unaccompanied by          light    The Vice-President          announced       that he
 had witnessed this in the most satisfactory manner in the case of
 heat polarized by reflection and transmission,                for which purposes,

                                         120
 instead of glass (which permits scarcely any non-luminous                    heat to
 penetrate    it),   Mr Forbes employs plates of mica, divided by                    a
 peculiar process into extremely thin lamime.
    But the analogies which he       has established between          light and heat
do not stop here.        It has been found       in the   case  of light, that, when
the two reflecting plates before spoken of, or the two crystals, are
placed in unconformable positions, so that little or no light reaches
the eye, we may, by interposing            between the plates or the crystals
a   thin lamina of      a  doubly refracting substance (such as mica) in a
certain position (relatively to its internal structure), cause a portion
of light, which before was incapable of reaching                 the eye, to become
capable    of  so doing.      In other words, the polarized light, which at
 first was incapable of reflection or transmission at the second plate
or crystal, now becomes capable of it          ;  it has lost, to   a certain extent,
its character of polarisation, or it is said to          be depolarized.
    Dr Hope stated, that he had             seen     this to be most completely
effected   in the     case of heat, by    Mr Forbes.         A   lamina of mica is
interposed between the bodies used to polarize heat unconformably
placed.     When the lamina of mica has             a certain position, no effect is
produced beyond stopping a small portion of the heat, which would
otherwise reach the thermometer          ;  but when this interposed lamina
is turned 45° in its own- plane, a portion of the heat which before
was    incapable of reaching the thermometer in consequence                     of its
polarization, is now capable of doing so, and the influx of heat is
instantly indicated.        The most striking exemplification of this result
is found in the fact, which excited so much interest when communi
cated more than a year ago to the Society, that            in certain  cases the mere
interposition     of  a piece  of mica (in the proper situation),          will  cause
an immediate indication of increased temperature, the mica depolar
izing more heat than it stops.         Since depolarization takes place only
in. consequence      of double refraction, we have here another undoubted
proof of the double refraction of heat.
     The Vice-President         terminated his general          and    rapid   sketch,
in which he alluded to the              brilliant      discoveries      of  Brewster,
Arago, and Fresnel, respecting the polarization                of light, by observ
ing, that it would be needless         for him to point out the important

                                        121
bearing    of  these    facts on the      question    of  the nature    of heat,
and   its connection with light             He concluded in the following
terms :— " It now only remains for              me   to present to    Professor
Forbes    the medal which has been awarded to him for these dis
coveries.    I   believe    that   I  shall   be joined cordially by every
member of the Society            who now hears me, in the fervent wish
that it may be the       will of the Almighty Euler, that his life may
be long protracted,      with vigour of mind and health of body to pur
sue the career    in which he has      made an advancement so honourable
to himself,     and reflecting lustre upon those great establishments,
the University and the Royal Society, with which he is connected.
I cannot    doubt that he     will  persevere   in this happy path with the
same ardour and success          which have hitherto        acompanied his re
searches.     Indeed, we have a gratifying proof that his zeal           will not
be impaired, nor      his  success less  brilliant, from the discovery in the
same field announced         by him at the last meeting of the Society, of
the Circular Polarization of Heat"

           — From            the   Imperial Academy.
 The following Papers were read                               :
      1.    On the Non-Hellenic portion of the Latin Language.                                              By
             the Venerable Archdeacon Williams.
   The line of argument went to show, that the TJmbri were one of
the most ancient nations of Italy. That they, through their colonies
or entire tribes, entered deeply into the composition'of the primitive
population    of Bome.     That, according to ancient authorities,
these      TJmbri were the descendants of the "Vcteres Galli." That
these      Veteres Galli were of the same race and blood as the present
Cumbri of Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany. That hence                  pro                          it   is
bable, that the ancient language still preserved among these may
have entered easily into the composition of the language of the
Romans.    That the names of rivers, mountains, cities, lakes, districts,
&c. in central Italy, and in all the countries over which the Sabel-
lian tribes, and their                      cognate      race the Veneti,           diffused themselves,
is likely to convert this probability into certainty. That the ques
tion concerning the ancient population of Italy has never yet been
satisfactorily treated                  ;    that   it   never can be, unless the examiner                  is
well acquainted not only with the language, but also the literature
of Greece and Rome, and with at least one type or form of the
several Teutonic and Celtic languages.    That    slight acquaintance            a
with other forms     also very desirable.
                                   is      That the writer professes
to be conversant with Greek, Roman, and Cumbrian literature, and
to   certain extent with the Anglo-Saxon, and that he knows some
     a
thing of the Gaelic and Basque tongues.     That no examination of
indexes can avail, owing to the peculiar character of the Cumbrian
tongue, in which   person ignorant of the principles of its grammar
                                   a
might suspect that there was nothing fixed, while, on the contrary,
it  the most fixed and indestructible of all languages.
     is                                                     That the

                                    123
vocabularies of the Latin and Cumbrian           languages are strikingly
similar, although their grammars are radically different.         That the
work    of comparing     the  two languages etymologically would be
easy, had   it not been for the long stay of the Eomans in Gaul and
Britain, which must     be supposed to have made        a deep  impression
upon the language of the natives.         That nevertheless many Latin
words exist, to the primary meaning of which the Cumbrian
scholar alone possesses the key, and that a long list of words belonging
to such a class must prove that some cognate branch of his language
must have entered into the original composition of the Latin tongue.
That the strength of proof must depend upon the extent of the
induction.
   2.  On the Sources and Composition of the different kinds
          of Gamboge. By Dr Christison.
   3.  On the Botanical Origin of Gamboge.              By Dr Graham.
   Gamboge was first made known by Clusius about the commence
ment of the seventeenth century, as a concrete          juice from China.
About the middle of the same century, Bontius conceived he had
traced it to a particular species of Euphorbia, growing in Java and
in Siam   ; from the latter of which countries tho whole gamboge of
commerce      was at that time obtained.        About the close of that
century Hermann       announced that gamboge was produced by two
species   of trees growing in Celyon, which have been since often
confounded together, but which        are now designated by the names
 Garcinia gambogia and Stalagmitis gambogioides.                About   the
middle of last century, gamboge        was  referred by Linnaeus to the
former of these     plants, and his reference was generally admitted.
But about thirty years later, Professor Murray of Gottingen con
ceived he had traced it satisfactorily from the specimens collected
by Koenig       in Ceylon,   and   information     obtained  by the   same
botanist in Siam, to a new species         which he called Stalagmitis
gambogioides.
   Dr Graham shows, from specimens and drawings sent from Cey
lon, both by Mrs Colonel Walker to himself, and by David Ander
son Blair, Esq., to the late Dr Duncan, that the plant producing
Ceylon gamboge is neither Garcinia gambogia, as Linna;us thought,
nor Xanthochijmvji ovalifolius, as conjectured by Dr Wight and Mr
Amott, nor Stalagmitis gambogioides, according to Murray and
Koenig, but is a species described by Lamarck and Gartner under

                                        124
 the name of     Oarcinia or Mangostana morella, although it differs
 from all of these genera in the structure of its stamens, and, there
 fore, probably    ought to be considered a new genus among those
 producing a gambogioid juice.
    Dr Christison proved, that, at the present time, Ceylon        gamboge
 is not an article of European       commerce,   and that the whole gam
boge of the markets of this        country comes, as in the time of Bon-
tius,  from   China.     After mentioning the analysis of fine gamboge
made by Braconnot in France and John in Prussia, he stated the
following as the mean composition of the several varieties of gam
boge he has hitherto      examined    : —

    The proportion of the gum to the resin varied somewhat in each
 variety, but never differed more than 2 per cent, from the means
 given above.
    The author added, that he had found the resin to be the active
 principle of gamboge.

                                       125
   He inferred from the composition of the different kinds of            gam
boge, and other circumstances detailed in his paper, that the            cake
gamboge or Siam is not entirely a natural production,           but  a manu
factured article ; that      Ceylon    gamboge,   if  freed from   incidental
fibrous    matter,   corresponds    almost    exactly   with Siam gamboge;
that,   therefore,   they are probably      produced    by the same    plant  ;
that Ceylon     gamboge     possesses   precisely the same    medicinal   pro
perties  ; and that this variety,     if more carefully collected, may,     in
all probability,   be applied with equal advantage to every economical
purpose    which   is at present served by the finest pipe gamboge of
Siam

          lourable Matters in the Leaves and Flowers of Plants,
                                                           which
          particularly in reference to the Principles upon
           Acids and Alkalies act in producing Red and Yellow
           or Green       By Dr Hope, V. P R. S. E           ,   F. R.    S.   [Con
           tinued from 18th Jan.]
   After premising        general remarks respecting the object
                          some                                  of
research, and enumerating the various authors who had written
                                                    which were to
upon the subject, Dr Hope explained various terms
be used in the discourse.   To the various coloured matters pre
sented by the leaves and flowers of plants, De Candolle had ap
plied the denomination of Chromule, which term he meant
                                                        to adopt.
   There resides in the            of plants, in addition to the chro
                              same parts
mule, some matter probably destitute of colour, which becomes red
by the action of acids, and yellow or green by the action of alka
lies.    To it Mr Ellis gave        the name   of colourable matter, which the
author changes to Chromogen.     When an acid, added to a vegetable
infusion, causes a red colour, and an alkali a yellow or green, it has
been the universal        opinion    that both sets of agents act upon one
 and the same colourable principle.            The leading object of this pa
 per is to shew that the Chromogen, or colourable principle, is not
 an individual substance ; and that there are two distinct principles,
 one which forms the red compound with acids, which he denomi
 nates Erythrogen     ;   and another, which       affords   a       yellow compound
 with alkalies, which      he calls Xanthogen.
    To establish that opinion, Dr Hope made many experiments on
 the leaves and flowers of plants, with various reagents, principally
 water, alcohol, acids, and alkalies : and has exhibited the results in
 the compendious form of tables.   The first table presents the result
 of experiments on the leaves of many plants ; and the general result
 from them, in regard to the special object of inquiry,   that   ad      is,    in
 dition to the green Chromule, denominated Chlorophyle by manv
 writers, they all contain Xanthogen, and that none of them, except

                                         127
 ing those which      have   some    tint different from the green, contain
 Erythrogen.
    The second table exhibits the result of the action of the reagents
upon white flowers, all of which, to the number of about thirty,
gave proofs      of their containing Xanthogen, but no Erythrogen nor
tinted Chromule of any kind.
    The third table displays the results with yellow flowers, from
which the general inferences are, that the yellow Chromule varies
in its nature in different flowers; that all those subjected to expe
riment contained Xanthogen,            and none of them Erythrogen.
    The fourth table exhibits the experiments with red flowers,             and
affords the general conclusions,         that while  the red chromule shews
considerable variety of character, red flowers contain both Xantho
gen and Erythrogen in abundance.
    The fifth table exhibits the results with twenty blue flowers, and
presented the general observations, that the blue Chromule varies in
its character in different blossoms, particularly in shewing very           dif
ferent degrees      of solubility in water and alcohol,     and  in some pro
ducing coloured,       and in others colourless,     solutions  in both men
strua   ; and th«v they contain both the colourable principles         of Xan
thogen and Erythrogen.
    The sixth table relates to ten orange flowers, which equally
shews that the orange Chromule differs much in one plant from
another, and that they contain both colourable principles.
    The seventh table relates to twenty purple flowers, and afforded
the same conclusions as the preceding.
    The eighth table exhibits the experiments made upon the tinted
 Chromule found in other parts of plants, beside the corolla of the
flowers,    e. g. the calyx, bractea, the coloured leaves     of plants, fruits,
and    surface   of the roots, all which comported themselves           as the
corresponding coloured Chromules of the flowers do.
   Litmus presented a solitary example, but a very interesting one
in this inquiry, of a substance abounding largely in Erythrogen, but
containing no Xanthogen.
   A   table was also presented,        exhibiting the general facts relative
to the power      of sulphurous acid in decolorizing       the Chromules      of
plants.      This acid, whether         employed   in its gaseous or liquid
form, does not decolorize        the   Chlorophyle of leaves.     It does not
affect    white flowers.     It did not decolorize any one of about a
score     of yellow flowers submitted to its action.            Of thirty or

                                      128
forty red flowers it decolorized           all, with the exception of two or
three.      Of twenty blue flowers, two, the Commelina               ceerulea,  and
the blue Centaurea Cyanus, resisted its blanching power.                   It deco
lorized some of the orange-coloured               flowers,   but rendered others
of them of      a bright yellow:      it decolorized       all the purple flowers
that were tried, with        the exception        of purple Centaurea Cyanus,
which it rendered blue, and the purple Scabiosa atropurpurea, which
 it reddened.      It affected the tinted Chromule occurring in other
parts of plants than blossoms          ;  it completely blanches the internal
leaves of the red cabbage, which are of a bright purple red, while
it renders the external bluish-purple leaves green.                  It turned to
green various leaves,        which possessed red tints, whether             general
over the whole leaf, as the red beet, or partially diffused, as in some
species of Dracaena.        It decolorizes      some fruits, while others resist
 its action.
    Along with the general facts, the various hypotheses respecting
the origin of the different Chromules, and sources of the differences
amongst them, the autumnal coloration of leaves, &c., were brought
under consideration.
    Lastly, a detail was given of the influence of lighhin the produc
tion of different Chromules, shewing that it is indispensable for the
production of the Chlorophyle of leaves, and the tinted Chromules
formed during the autumnal coloration of the same parts ; and that
it is not indispensable for the formation of some of the finest tints
of flowers and fruits, if essential for any.
    The paper terminated with the following general conclusion                      :
That there exist in plants two distinct colourable principles, two
species of Chromogen, one which generates red compounds with
acids, and denominated Erythrogen              ;  and another which forms yel
low compounds with alkalies, called Xanthogen.                    That  these   two
principles occur together in red and blue flowers,               and in the leaves
of  a few plants     which    exhibit    the former     of these tints   ;  that all
green leaves, all white and all yellow flowers, and white fruits, con
tain Xanthogen alone ; that Litmus abounds in Erythrogen, but has
no Xanthogen       ; that the Chromules of different tints may be gene
rally considered distinct vegetable principles, or compounds having
their own proper hue ; sometimes intimately blended, or chemically
combined with Chromogen ; at other times having no connexion
with it   ;  that they are also occasionally, but not frequently,              com
pounds of Chromogen with acids or alkalies.

    The second part of          t'.ie paper will comprehend          an  inquiry into
the special character and properties             of the two colourable principles,
the Erythrogen and Xanthogen.
    2.   On Dyspnoea, and other Sensations experienced on the
           summit of Mont Blanc.                      By Martin Barry, M. D.
           Communicated by              Dr Alison.
    Tiiirst and  loss     of appetite were the first symptoms experienced
by Dr Barry      at a     height of about 14,000 feet; but it was not till
he reached a height 1000 feet greater,                that exhaustion and fatigue
supervened.       A tendency to fainting             was felt, and a total indiffe
rence to the main object of the journey.                     After a  few minutes of
rest, these    sensations disappeared,            but were again perceived on
proceeding     a few       steps.      On the summit (15,666 feet above the
sea; Barom. 17.052, Detached                  Therm.     30°)   no particular    lassi
tude was felt while the author performed his experiments.                       After
the descent the author did not suffer from a state of collapse.
    It was shewn, that of          those who have ascended         Mont Blanc and
other high mountains, some have suffered more, others less, — that
 there have been differences in this respect, not only among indivi
duals of the same party at the same time, but in the same person
at different times     ;  how far referrible to the condition of the system,
 and bow far to atmospheric changes,               is  still uncertain.
    Respiration,    and even continued muscular exertion, which neces
sarily accelerates       the breathing, are possible in very attenuated air,
 as among the inhabitants           of lofty regions ; but by any great and sud
 den   change of density, whether of increase or diminution, this func
 tion becomes embarrassed.
    There is reason to believe that the quantity of oxygen                   absorbed
by the lungs does not always bear the same ratio to the quantity
received into their cells.           At least, if the evolution of animal heat
is  directly as the oxygen           absorbed ;   for   on this supposition    the air
at Chamoni      having       a density     — 27, that on the summit         of Mont
 Blanc = 17, and the temperature at the upper station being many
degrees below that at the lower, the absorption of oxygen must
have been,     not relatively         alone,  but also absolutely greater, from
the rarer than from the denser air.
    The occurrence of hemorrhages                  in   the ascent   of high moun
tains has been     a  frequent, but very variable phenomenon, and some

                                                 130
of these have probably been simply mechanical effects of the inter
nal and external pressures not being at first in equilibrio.
  3.    Mr     Smith of Jordanhill                  made a verbal           communication
            regarding a change in the Relative Levels of the land
            and sea on the west coast of Scotland ; recent shells
            having been found even at the height of 70 feet.
   4.   Professor Forbes communicated the following memoran
          dum respecting the Polarization of Heat.
   " I have recently ascertained the following facts respecting heat.
   " 1st, That heat
                     polarized in any plane, and then reflected from
the surface     of   a refracting        medium, changes its plane of polariza
tion in a manner similar to what obtains in the case of light.                        Thus,
with    a   thick plate of mica, which polarized homogeneous red light
most completely at an incidence of about 59°, the plane of polari
zation of reflected polarized heat remained on the same side of the
plane       of reflection when the incidence was great, and was                       on the
contrary side when the incidence was small.                        The limiting angle of
incidence was about 57°, which therefore should be the polarizing
angle of dark heat for mica.                     This mode of observing the polarizing
angle offers some advantages above more direct methods.
   " 2dly, Metals polarize heat extremely feebly by reflection.                             I
have carried my experiments up to 85° from silver, yet even there
but a small share is polarized.                     The effect    is,   however,   distinctly
 recognizable        through    a   considerable range           of incidences.      The ef
 fects are such as would            indicate the maximum polarizing                 angle to
 be even much higher     perhaps
                               ;    never attains   maximum.
                                                   it            This   a
 fact corresponds to that in the case of light, except that the maxi
 mum polarizing          73° (Brewster).
                        angle      is      Did metals act on light
 like other bodies, we should conclude, from the polarizing angle
 being greater, that heat more refrangible than light. An import
                                    is
 ant remark of Sir D. Brewster's, however, shews the statement                            I
 have made to be in conformity with the views of the nature of heat
 which  I     have published.            He finds the maximum polarizing angle
 to be greatest for the feast refrangible rays.
    " 3dly, Heat polarized              in   a   plane inclined 45° to the plane of sub
 sequent reflection at silver, has its nature changed as in the case of
 light, and presents the conditions of elliptic polarization, though the

                                     131
 ellipse is much      more elongated,    even  at  great   angles   of inci
 dence.
    " 4thly, Two reflections from silver increase the
                                                           polarizing effect
 of metals. This fact has its counterpart in light. Two reflections
 likewise produce an increased tendency to circular polarization
 when the plane of reflection is inclined 45° to that of primitive
 polarization.    This effect increases with the obliquity of incidence
 up to considerable angles.
    " These observations     have been verified in the case    of heat from
 various sources, obscure as well     as luminous."

       The following Communications were read            :
    1. On Paracyanogen and its Compounds.              By James F. W.
          Johnston, Esq.
    In this paper the author shewed that pure dry bicyanide of mer
cury, when heated in close vessels, gave off mercury and pure cya
nogen only, yet that there remained always in the retort a portion
of a black substance of variable density and lustre.         He then pro
ceeded,   by  a new series   of analyses, to confirm what    he had stated
several years ago, that this black substance is identical in composi
tion with cyanogen, being, like that gas, represented by the formula
NC2.      To this solution   he gives the name    of Paracyanogen.       He
then stated that the black substance deposited in strong prosaic
acid, by a solution of cyanogen in water, in alcohol, in solution of

                                                  132
caustic ammonia or caustic potash, after heating to redness, had the
same composition.  The black matter from solution of cyanogen in
alcohol may be obtained in large quantity,                         by saturating            the   same
portion of alcohol with cyanogen gas day after day as the odour of
the gas disappears           pint of alcohol being capable of absorbing the
                                ;    a
whole       of the   cyanogen given off by four or five pounds of bicyanide
of mercury, becoming black and thick like treacle. The deposit
collected on the filter dissolves readily in solution of caustic potash,
and is precipitated by acids of a dark brown colour.      In this state
it appears to have the composition represented by                          H+N2C3. When
heated to redness in close vessels, it gives off carbonate of ammo
nia, and leaves paracyanogen, according to the formula
                  HNfiC3 +               2   HO = NCB + (H3N + CO,                  ,).
     The paracyanogen dissolves in sulphuric acid giving                           a   dark brown
ish-red solution, from which water precipitates                         it   unchanged.           Boil
ed     in   the acid, carbonic and sulphurous acids are given off, and                                a
partial      oxydation          of the paracyanogen takes place.                       Nitric acid,
either cold or hot, acts very slightly on the paracyanogen from                                      bi
cyanide       of mercury, but dissolves readily in the cold, that prepared
 by    the other processes, giving               a   dark reddish-brown            solution, from
which water precipitates the paracyanogen                           apparently unchanged.
Hot nitric acid, however, dissolves the black substance from cyano
gen in alcohol, &c. with evolution of copious red fumes, giving                                       a
bright reddish- yellow, or  pale amber-yellow solution, from which
                                             a
water precipitates             a     beautiful   bright yellow powder.                 This yellow
substance       is   paracyanic acid.
     This acid       is   chiefly characterized         by its great stability.                It   dis
solves in nitric          and sulphuric acids,          and   is   very easily decomposed,
even when boiled               in    these menstrua.      When heated in               a    close ves
sel,   it   gives off carbonic acid and nitrogen, and leaves paracyano
gen.        Another very marked character        its affinity for the oxides
                                                           is
of mercury.           A    solution of the paracyanic              in   concentrated nitric or
sulphuric acid            is   precipitated      largely and immediately                  by   nitrates
and sulphates of mercury.                       The salt of mercury, too,   only par   is
tially decomposed                   by   boiling in these acids. The salt of silver                   is
more soluble, but may also be obtained        adding dry nitrate of
                                                                by
silver to  solution of the acid in concentrated nitric acid.
              a                                               These
salts constitute yellow powders more or less bright                           ;    they seem also
susceptible of crystallization.                  From   the' analysis        of   the acid and its

                                              133
salt of silver,        the author         considers the acid to be composed of
N4C8 +       0.    The investigation,           however, is still incomplete,                  and
this composition is only given as probable and open to correction.
   Like cyanogen, joaracyauogen                seems capable           of uniting with the
metals to form paracyanides, though, from                       its   insolubility in ordi
nary menstrua, it is not easy to obtain them free from paracyanates.
   2.     On the newly discovered microscopic Entozoon infesting
           the Muscles of the Human Body.     Hy Dr Knox.
   The author commenced his observations by remarking                                   that this
very interesting entozoon was discovered in 1833, by Mr Hilton,
who first saw the cysts enclosing the worms, and supposed them to
be cysticerci.     Shortly thereafter, Mr Paget discovered the worm
itself.     Further information was given in two excellent memoirs by
Dr Farre and Mr Owen                 ;   and to the views of the former                 of these
gentlemen the author chiefly leans.
   Throughout the observations, he endeavours to shew, that the
origin of this entozoon is very obscure, and is not referrible to any
known bodily ailment or mode of life.     He differs also from pre
ceding observers, both in respect to the form                       of   the cyst, its struc
ture, and its connexions         ;       the form    he makes out to be oval, the
structure distinctly granular and not cellular, that                         is,   not composed,
as some have conjectured,                out of the surrounding cellular                    tissue   ;
and the connexion not universal, but towards the extremities.                                  He
conjectures also, that the granular                 structure    discovered            by   him on
the exterior      of   the    cysts may be the germs of future individual
worms and cysts.
   The aged person, whose muscles after death presented                                these en
tozoon in such numbers, was quite healthy until                          a   short period be
fore her demise.

           The following Communications were read                           :
      1.   On the Origin of the Adjective.                     By Professor Pillans.
   The principal object of this paper was to exhibit the manner in
which, in the early stages of the history of language, the adjective
may be supposed to have originated from the noun        Before stat
ing his views of this subject, the author dwelt at some length on
the universal           principle which influences the formation                    of all   lan
guages, according to which man, when he has once acquired a small
stock of words, will have recourse to all manner of expedients to
save     himself the invention of new terms ; and an instance was given
 in   the various applications of the derivatives and compounds of the
 Latin word Calx.   In following out this principle, it seemed not
unlikely that when the  savage met, in a new substance, with a qua
lity which formed the distinguishing character of an object he was
 already familiar with, he would apply the noun or name of that fa
 miliar object, to express the attribute or quality as he found it to
 exist in that which was quite new to him                       ;    so -that, supposing the
 plant wormwood to be well-known to him, and the bitter orange not
 at all, he would, on falling in with that fruit, and tasting exclaim,              it,
 this orange          is   wormwood;         and the latter    term might thus come to

                                          136
 be established as the expression          of that peculiar sensation wherever
 it  was found, and even         to lose, in many cases, its original substan
tive application.        Various examples were given from our own lan
guage, all tending to prove             bow apt the mind is to employ the
 names     of objects, not only to denote the aggregate of properties
which makes up the notion of that object, but occasionally also to
express its predominant and distinctive quality as it exists in             a  dif
ferent substance,       which has no other attribute in common with it.
     2.   On Single and Correct Vision by means of Double and
            Inverted Images on the Retina?.               By Dr Alison.
     The author      began   by endeavouring        to state with precision the
nature of the difficulty which has been long felt on this subject.
Two general facts are well ascertained,              and  present fair objects of
inquiry, 1. That images formed on corresponding points of the
retinae of the human eyes, and on these only, naturally affect the mind
in the same manner as a single image, formed on the retina of either
eye    ;  and, 2. That impressions        made on different points of the re
tina of the eye, are naturally followed by inferences as to the re
lative position of the objects producing them, exactly opposite to
those which follow impressions made on different points of the sur
face of the body.
     Facts observed by Dr Reid and others, and confirmed by per
sonal observation, appear to the author quite sufficient to shew, in
opposition to the opinion of Berkeley and of Dr Brown, that these
phenomena cannot be explained by reference to experience and as
sociation       and the law    of visible direction,    regarded by some as an
explanation, is in fact only a general expression          of these phenomena      ;
and      Dr Reid distinctly stated, when        he laid down     that law, that a
                                                "                        of vision
farther     step was to be     expected, and       a more general law
                              if  we should come to know          "
might be discovered,"                                               the structure
and use of the choroid          membrane, the optic nerves and brain, and
what impressions are made on them by means of the pictures on the
retina?."
     The theory of Newton, which ascribes single vision by images
formed on corresponding points of the retina, to the circumstance of
the corresponding        points of the retina being connected (by means of
a   semi-dccussation of the optic nerves at their commissure), with the
same points      in the sensorium,     was next considered,     and stated to be

                                         137
perfectly satisfactory,    if   the anatomical facts are as the theory sup
poses.       The proof of the actual connexion of corresponding points
of the  retinae, with the same points in the corpora quadrigemina
or optic lobes (which physiological, still more than anatomical facts,
point out as the true origin of the optic nerves), is still defective ;
but several facts stated on the subject by Wollaston, Mayo, Serres,
and others, tend to support the theory.
   In regard      to correct vision by means           of inverted     and    reverted
images on the retina of the eye, the author stated, and endeavoured
to shew by preparations,
                          (what was first suggested to him by Mr
Dick, veterinary surgeon,) that at least in the mammalia, and pro
bably also lower in the scale of animals, the peculiar convoluted
course of the traetut optici, and the mode of their implantation into
the optic lobes, are such, that although the impressions made on the
retina by the different         parts   of                      by the
                                             an object are necessarily,
laws of optics, situated in regard to one another in the inverse order
of those made on the surface of          the body, yet the impressions made
through the retina and optic nerves on the optic lobes                  (i.   e.   on the
upper extremity  of the cerebro-spinal axis) are in the same order
as those made through the nerves of touch, on that central portion
of the nervous system, on which the sensibility of all nerves de
pends and therefore that the notions which we form of the rela
         ;
tive position of the parts of objects          by   the senses   of sight    and touch
will naturally correspond.
   But although this seems sufficient to explain how the impressions
made     by
          any object of sight on either optic lobe are            in
                                                       the same order
as those made on the sense of touch, yet in all animals which use
both eyes in looking at an object, and (by reason of the partial de
cussation) both optic lobes in looking with one eye, another diffi
culty presents itself. The impressions made on each lobe are   the                     in
right order, but those made on the two lobes are transposed                        ;   those
made     by   the left portion of the field of vision, even of         a    single eye,
falling on the right side       of the retina, and being transferred to the
right optic lobe, and     vice versa.       The error which would thence re.
suit, the author thinks,        is   rectified   by
                                                  means of another piece of
structure, the use of which has never been explained, viz. the decus
sation at the pyramidal bodies, whereby, as    generally believed,
                                                           is
the whole sensation  and voluntary motion of the  left side of the
body are placed in connexion with the right side                  of the brain,         and
vice versa.

                                     138
    Accordingly, it appears, that in those animals where the partial
 decussation of the optic nerves exists, making the sensations of each
 eye dependent on both optic lobes, (viz. in all the mammalia and
 birds,) the decussation at the pyramids also exists, according to the
 observations    of Cuvier, Serres, and others ; and the sensation and
 motion of either side of the body appear from the experiments of
 Flourens and others,     as well  as from observations   of the effects of
 injury or   disease,  to be dependent on the other side of the brain      ;
 whereas in reptiles and fishes, where there is no commissure of the
optic nerves, and one optic lobe only is concerned in the vision of
one eye, there is no decussation at the pyramids, and no crossing ef
fect of injury of the brain, to the opposite side of the body, has been
 observed.
    If this speculation be well founded      (and it is admitted that far
ther anatomical inquiries      are requisite to justify a decided opinion
upon it), the peculiar course and mode of implantation of the opt ic
nerves, in most if not all animals, and the partial decussation of the
optic nerves, and the decussation at the pyramids in the two higher
classes, are all parts of the arrangement by which Nature brings the
intimations given by the sense of Sight, which are        of course partly
regulated by the laws of light, into harmony with those given by
the sense of Touch, which have no connexion with these laws ; and
enables those animals that use both eyes at once, to derive correct
information as to the number and position of objects from the sen
sations simultaneously      excited in both, notwithstanding      that the
images which are essential to these sensations are double, inverted,
and reverted.                                               i

       Observations on the Chemical Nomenclature of Inorganic
          Compounds.       By Dr Hope.
    The object of this paper is to propose     a modification   of the no
menclature     of inorganic compounds now in        use  among chemists,
 which shall display with accuracy the ingredients of each compound,
 and the atomic ratios of each ingredient.
    After stating the introduction of the principle of employing      a de
scriptive   nomenclature   in chemistry by Bergman,        and the happy
application of it by Lavoisier and his associates,      and subsequently
by Berzelius,    he traced   the various   changes rendered      necessary
by the improved      knowledge    of the more intimate constitution of
 compounds, resulting from the discovery of combination in defi
 nite proportions, and the atomic ratios in which combinations take
 place, adopted by    Wollaston, Thomson, Thenard, Turner, &c.          He

                                            140
  next pointed out several imperfections in the nomenclature now
 in use in chemical writings, and explained a modification of it which
 he conceived to be more precise, completely descriptive,               and ad
 mitting of application to every case and proportion of combination.
    He suggested, 1st, That the prefixes of proto, per, super, and sub,
now in common use, should be discontinued,                  as unnecessary, —as
possible sources      of confusion — and       as deviating from the sound rule,
of employing numerals of the same order and language to denote a
continued series of any compound.
    2d, That the happy suggestion of Dr Thomson, of employing the
Greek adverbial numerals to denote the number of atoms or equi
valents   of   base,   and the Latin         the number    of atoms of oxygen,
acid, &c. should be adopted.
    3d, That the interweaving              of the Latin and Greek atomic    nu
merical indications      in the same word ought to be avoided as much
as possible.
    The following tabular views of the nomenclature of oxides, and
of metallic salts, were given as specimens of the nomenclature of
the more simple and more complicated combinations.

    He called the attention of the Society to         an apparent   deviation
 from the principle    of the nomenclature, which he adopted for the
 sake  of abhreviation, while it cannot possibly create any confusion.
 When speaking of the combination of an acid, e. g. the sulphuric
 with an oxide of a metal, say iron, the atomic constitution of which
is one atom of metal and one of oxygen, he calls the compound
sulphate of iron, not sulphate of oxide of iron, because every
chemist is aware that invariably the metal is in the state of an
oxide when in union with an acid.
    He concluded by inculcating the importance of chemical writers
and teachers employing uniformly the same nomenclature, and ex
pressing his hope that the modification now proposed may meet the
approbation of his fellow-labourers          in the Edinburgh School.
8.  Mr   Stark read   a  communication from          Dr Parnell   on the oc
         currence of the Clupea alba, or White Bait, and of the
         Raniceps trifurcatus, or Tadpole-fish, in the Frith of
         Forth.     Specimens      were exhibited.
   Dr Parnell endeavoured to         state the specific characters by which

                                    H2
the white bait may be distinguished       from the shad, the herring, the
sprat, and the pilchard.
    In the white bait, the tongue and roof of the mouth are furnished
with three or four rows of distinct teeth ; these parte in the shad
are destitute of teeth.
    The dorsal fin of the herring is placed half way between the point
of the upper jaw, and end of the long caudal rays ; the same fin in
the white bait is situated much nearer the tip of the tail than to the
point of the upper jaw     ;  the body is more compressed,    of a lighter
colour, and the belly is much rougher to the touch, under the pec
torals, than is observed in the herring.
    The origin of the ventral fins, in the sprat, is placed before the
first dorsal ray ; in the white bait, it is situated behind the third dor
sal ray.
    The pilchard   has  its dorsal fin placed exactly in the centre     of
gravity, so that, when the fish is held up by the anterior rays, the
body preserves an equilibrium ; whereas, if the white bait be taken
up by the same part, the head will be observed to- dip considerably.

   The following papers were read           :
   1.   An Attempt to ascertain          the   Relative      Positions of the
          Athenian and Syracusan           Lines before Syracuse, from
          the Description of Thucydides.             By Professor Dunbar.
   The object of this paper was to ascertain the position of the Athe
nian and Syracusan lines from the language employed by Thucy
dides, particularly the prepositions. The author was led to examine
the account    of these lines given by Goellen and Dr Arnold, in their
editions of Thucydides,       and the maps they have subjoined, and to
compare them with the historian's descriptions.            He pointed out the
error into which both       seem to have fallen,     respecting the fortifica
tions of Temnites,     as it did not appear, from the historian's state
ment, that the district was entirely inclosed, but only that part
fronting Epi poiae. He also endeavoured to shew that the cross
wall, built by the Syracusans, to intercept the Athenian lines in the
direction   of Trogilus, could not have been constructed on the south
of the Temnites, as Dr Arnold supposes, but on the north of the
slope of Epipohe, and (hat it was not entirely destroyed by the
Athenians.

                                      144
    The direction and nature of the third couuter-work of the Syra-
cusans he supposed were also misunderstood             by Goellen,     Dr Ar
nold, and other commentators and editors.         It did  not appear to have
been carried in a direction      to cut the Athenian   lines of circumvalla-
tion towards Trogilus, but, after it had reached a certain length in
the direction of their wall, it was then carried northwards, and
parallel to the Athenian lines      ; and this appeared evident from the
language employed by the historian, in his description          of the battles
that were fought between the lines of both parties          ; and   the use of
the preposition             in composition   with the verbs uxo^i* and
ilXfiluti. He also shewed that this parallel wall was afterwards car
ried forward to the t/nJ^rut tH%*(, or cross wall.          The author then
 described the position of the three Syracusan         camps on Epipolae,
 which were attacked by Demosthenes, in the night               expedition to
turn the Syracusan lines, and pointed out the errors into which Or
Arnold seems to have fallen, in his account of them, as also the mis
application of the term a-agaru'-ginuc, which he thinks should be
niyjirua., or an advanced post.         He concluded by observing, that
the rout of the Athenians          must have commenced near the verge
of the slope of Epipolae, and not towards the bottom,            as has  been
 generally supposed.
        2. Researches     on Heat.      Second   Series.      By Professor
             Forbes.
     The author   states, that in a former paper on this subject, having
 confined himself to the establishment       of a number      of new facts in
 the science of heat,    embracing its polarization   by reflection, refrac
 tion, and double refraction,      and the depolarizing     action of doubly
 refracting  crystals, he proceeded, on resuming the subject, to ascer
 tain more accurately the laws of these phenomena.
     The first section of the paper relates to the methods of observa
 tion employed, and the examination        of the valnes of the degrees of
 the galvanometer,     which, for the most part, do not indicate equal
 increments    of force. Two tables are given. By the first, the sta
 tical deviations of the needle are reduced, so as to be measures of
 the force producing       them  ; and, by the second, the dynamical ef
 fect, or arc moved over by the initial disturbing action, is reduced
 to the final or statical effect, and thence to the true measure of heat.
  Several peculiarities   attendant on the use of the galvanometer are
    kewise discussed.

                                            145
     In the   second section, the observations         formerly published on the
polarizing      action of tourmaline          are confirmed,     including      the case
where heat entirely dark was employed.                    Of  all the observations
this alone has been attended with any difficulty in the verification.
     The third section treats of          the laws of the polarization       of heat by
refraction      or transmission.           The author denies that the results
given in the first series         of these researches were held out           as nume
rically accurate      ;  and he took occasion to state verbally, that whilst
an attempt has been made to depreciate the credit due to his obser
vations, on the ground of the numerical inaccuracy of his first re
sults, the objectors          themselves      seem   to have fallen into a graver
 mistake, that      of considering all kinds of heat equally polarizable at
 the same      angle of incidence. A great number of experiments have
 confirmed the opinion which the author formerly entertained, that
 heat from non-luminous             sources is less polarizable by a given plate
 of mica     at a given      angle of incidence than when accompanied by
 light.    He   has constructed polarizing         mica bundles of great tenuity,
 by using sudden heat to split that substance into a vast number
 of minute       laminae.      With one pair of such plates he obtained the
                                        ....
 following percentages of heat stopped when the planes of refraction
                                                ...
  in the two bundles were rectangular              :

          From boiling water,                                            44
   These observations were repeatedly made,                 and were confirmed by
  others made with         a  different pair of mica plates.         The results are
   shewn to agree with those obtained in the case                 of light    ;  the heat
   at the bottom     of the list being the least refrangible.
      In the fourth section the law of polarization by reflection is dis
   cussed. A number of reflecting surfaces were tried, and split mica
   was preferred.       The amount of polarization, by reflection at a given
   angle, is   shewn to vary with the source of heat ; and it is probable
   that the kinds     of heat do not rank in the          same order when the an
   gle is changed.        This    is the case in light.    The change of the           plane;
   of polarization by subsequent reflection is similar to that which                      oc
   curs when light is used.            (See page 130.)

                                          146
     The circular polarization of heat by total reflection forms the sub
ject of the fifth section. It had been shewn in the former series
that a suitable thickness of mica is capable of producing circular po
larization ; but the more critical experiment of producing this ef
fect by total reflection, in a plane inclined 45° to the plane of posi
 tive polarization,      remained to be accomplished.        This the author
 succeeded in doing,        by using rhombs of rock-salt,     or combinations
of two       prisms     of the   same     substance.   (See the Proceedings
for   1st  February 1836.)          When two total reflections at 60° were
employed, the appearance of polarization had almost vanished, pro
vided that the planes         of reflection and primitive polarization formed
an angle      of 45°.     But  if that  angle were 0° or 90°, no change was
 observable in the state       of polarization of the emergent light.
    3.  Dr Knox exhibited          some specimens to prove that the teeth
            of the Cachalot are devoid of enamel.
    When      a longitudinal    section of one    of these teeth  is made, two
substances present themselves, viz. a central and            a  cortical ; these
 differ from each other both in appearance and in structure.                The
central substance resembles, and is no doubt analogous to the ivory
of other teeth, but the cortical exhibits not the slightest analogy            to
 enamel.       In texture it is softer even than       the ivory portion,    and
probably       continues to grow or be deposited during the greater
part   of   the   life of the Cachalot, until it in fact at last completely
 encloses the central         part, which     can be nothing   but an ossified
 pulp  :  it encloses the central portion in the manner that the ivory of
 the human tooth encloses the soft dentar pulp.
     Sections    of   a great  variety of teeth of the Cetacea were shewn
 to  exhibit    a similar structure.

      1.  On an Arrangement of the Planets and Satellites, accord
             ing to their Distances and Masses.              By John Paterson,
             Esq. Schoolmaster of Douglas.
      The author     has suggested an empirical       law, which seems to him
  to regulate     the arrangement       of the planets and satellites.         Bode
  long ago proposed an empirical            law, which he thought        regulated
  the distances of the planets from the sun            ;  namely, that their dis
  tances form a series, increasing          by the successive      powers     of the
  number 2.       Mr   Paterson   has propounded         another   similar   law, in
  regard to their sizes     ; namely, that throughout         the planetary sys
 tem there is a regular alternating         increase and decrease in size, as
 the planets increase in distance from the sun, or the satellites from
 the planets they accompany          : that there is a progressive         increase
 from the first to the third, a decrease from the third to the fifth, an
 increase, again, from the fifth to the seventh, and again a decrease
 from the seventh to the ninth.           He illustrates this supposed law by
 referring to the respective      masses    of the planets, and of the satel
 lites of Jupiter and Saturn       ;  and he observes, that, in order to bring
 the whole solar system under the law, it is necessary that two new
planets be still discovered between Mars and Jupiter.
     The law thus conceived to exist, is deduced empirically alone                  ;
no reason is assigned why it ought to be observed in the constitu
tion   of the solar system.
     2. Notice regarding the Composition and Properties                     of cer
            tain Concrete Juices, resembling Gamboge.                      By Dr
            Christison.
    This notice is intended      as a supplement to the observations           read
last session by the author,       on the composition         and sources of the

                                        152
 different   kinds   of Gamboge.        It is well known that Linnaeus re
ferred gamboge to the Garcinia cambogia, Willd. ; and others have
supposed that a kind of gamboge is also produced by the Xantho-
chymtts pictorius.      Both are natives of Ceylon, where, as appears
from the former investigations          of the author, a substance is pro
duced almost or absolutely identical with Siam gamboge.                     It ap
peared, however, from the inquiries of Dr Graham, read before
the Society last session, that this Ceylon gamboge is produced by
an undescribed species of tree, and not by either of the species
just mentioned.
     Dr Christison has now been enabled to add to this investigation
 an account of the composition and properties of the concrete juices
 of the Garcinia cambogia and Xanthochymus pictorius, which were
 transmitted from Colombo by Mrs Colonel Walker.                      These con
 crete juices, which were sent attached to the barks that produced
 them, differ from gamboge in having a much paler yellow colour,
 and not being at all emulsive.         That of the Garcinia        cambogia   also
 differs in not being at all purgative,        at least in doses three or four
 times as great as the customary         doses    of gamboge ; and its colour
 ing resin possesses only a tenth part of the intensity of the colour
 of true gamboge resin. Farther, both the concrete juices in ques
 tion differ essentially from gamboge in composition, in so far as both
                           ....
 contain proportionally less gum, and one of them contains some vo
                           ....
 latile oil.   Their composition was found to be           as  follows : —
                  Resin                          66.0          76.5
                   Arabin                        14.0          17-6
                  Volatile oil  .     .     .    12.0           0.0
                  Accidental fibre    .      .    5.0           6.9
                  Ixws, probably volatile oil,    3.0           0.0
                                                100.0         100.0
     The author farther announced that Dr Graham had been lately
 enabled to determine, with the assistance of Dr Brown, certain
 points which he had left undecided in his paper of the previous ses
 sion, on the botanical source      of true Ceylon gamboge. It now ap
 pears, that the specimen from which Murray of Gottingen esta
 blished his Slalagmitis gambogioides, and which is still preserved in
 the Banksian Herbarium, is in reality a patched one, consisting,
 probably,    of the Xanthochymus ovalifolius          and    of the true plant.
 Dr Graham       has   therefore   felt no hesitation      in attaching to     Mrs
 Colonel Walker's specimens        a new generic name, derived           from the

                                   153
dehiscence of the anthers, namely, Hebradendron.         He has retained
the old specific name Gambogioides ; and he has          been enabled to
add to the new genus a second species,      H. ellipticum, found by     Dr
VVallich in Sylhet, and supposed by that botanist to be a Garcinia.
   3.  Farther account of indications of Changes in the relative
         Levels of the Sea and Land. By James Smith, Esq. of
         JordanhilL
    The new localities in which the author     has found    alluvial depo
sits containing marine remains, occur on both sides of the river
Clyde, in Loch Ryan, in the island of Skye, and on the east and
west coast of Ireland.      Near Glasgow, and in the county of Lime
rick, sea-shells were found about 80 feet above the level of high
water.     In the vicinity of Dublin the marine deposit was upwards
of 200 feet above the sea. Mr Smith considers that indications of
this change of level will be found on every part of the coasts of the
British islands.      The deposit belongs to the newer pliocene of
Lyell.    The   shells, of which about seventy different species have
been   collected,  agree in general with those now existing in the
British  seas.    There are, however,   some  of them which appear to
have become extinct, or at least are not known upon our coasts.

       The following Communications were read : —
   I . Observations on Terrestrial Magnetism                      made in different
           parts of Europe, especially with reference                     to the in
           fluence of Height.            By Professor Forbes.
   These observations have reference chiefly to the intensity                     of the
earth's magnetism,         and were made for the most part with Han-
steen's apparatus, in the possession            of the society.
   The Jirst section of the paper refers to the method of making the
observations, which is nearly that of Professor Hansteen.
   The second refers to the corrections applied.                  These are — 1. for
the rate of the chronometer ; 2. for reduction of the vibrations of
the intensity needles to infinitely small arcs ; 3. for the effect of tem
perature in diminishing the magnetism of the needles, which was
determined for each by direct experiment ; 4. for changes in the
earth's magnetism        ; 5. for progressive changes in the needle's mag
netism, which were considerable for one of the Hansteen needles,
but for the other very small.
   The third section contains tabular views of the results obtained
from different series of observations, but particularly from one se
ries made in the central chain            of Alps in 1832, and another in the
Pyrenees in 1835.          The horizontal        intensities    at several detached
points, as    Edinburgh, Brussels,          and Paris, were also ascertained;
that at Edinburgh is expressed by .840, Paris being 1.000.
    In the fourth section, the results are grouped and analyzed, the
Alpine series being first taken, and the relations of the intensities
determined with respect to latitude, longitude, and height.                         The
same was done for the Pyrenean observations ; the results being
not    merely graphically        deduced,      but actually      calculated    from    as
many equations        of condition       as there were stations, by the method
of least squares.        The following numbers were obtained               : —

    Of these     results, those obtained in the Alps, and by needle No. 1,
 arc the most trust-worthy.             From the variation due to latitude and
 longitude,    the direction of the isodynamic lines is easily found.                  In

the Alps, they form an angle           of about     78° with the meridian,         to the
E. of north, nearly coinciding with the geological axis of that part
of the chain. The results in the Pyrenees are of a more doubtful
character,     the observations    having      been made over a very small
area    of country, and exhibiting          some    They would ap

pear to indicate a direction from N. of W. to S. of E., which coin
cides with the mineralogical axis, and does not agree with Hans-
teen's map.
   With regard       to   the effect    of height, the author first considers
the evidence already brought to bear on the subject, which he con
siders as almost quite inconclusive, from the imperfect nature of
the data, and the limited extent            of the induction.        The result at
which he has arrived as the most probable, from the combination                        of
all his experiments, is a diminution of TC,i50th part of the intensity
for 3000 feet of ascent; a quantity so small, that it can only be ex
pected to be discovered by combining                 a great many observations.
The sum of the heights of the stations to which                  he has carried the
Hansteen apparatus, amounts to above                 160,000 feet, or 30 vertical
miles.
   In the fifth and last section of his paper, the author quotes his
observations     on magnetic      dip, which he has determined                 (with      a
small instrument) at a considerable number of points ; and by com
bining the results in the same manner as before, be has endeavoured
to approximate       to the position        of the lines of equal dip in the
Alps.
   2. Notice respecting a New Reflecting Microscope.                           By Mr
          Guthrie.        Communicated by Professor Forbes.
   Mr Guthrie modifies Amici's microscope, by removing altogether
the plane speculum, and placing the object to be viewed in the axis
of the tube. This arrangement is to the microscope what Sir W.
Herschel's     is to the reflecting telescope.      In order that the object
may be properly illuminated,           the part of the tube next the mirror
is wholly removed,        and three pillars substituted           for   it,   to one   of
which the stage for the object         is   attached, and regulated           by   an ad
justing screw.

    1.   On Tea Oil.               By Robert D. Thomson,               M.D.        Commu
           nicated by            Dr Christison.
    A    species   of fixed oil, familiarly        used in China       for the     same eco
nomical purposes for which                olive oil is employed             in Europe, has
been ascertained by recent travellers                  in China to be produced in all
probability by the tea-piant,             or another species of the same natural
family.  The author assigns reasons for believing that it either                             is,
or may  be, obtained from the seeds of various species of the two
genera Thea and Camellia.     It has been hitherto almost unknown
in Europe.         when fresh quite free of smell, of
                   It   is                              pale yellow          a
tint, without any sediment when long kept.         resists    cold of
                                                                   It              a

It insoluble in alcohol, sparingly soluble in ether.

a   remarkahly      clear white flame.            It   consists   of 75 parts of elaine,
and 25 of stearine           ;   whence the author infers its elementary com
position to be, oxygen 9.853, carbon 78.619, hydrogen 11.527.
He    isinclined to think that this oil might prove an important ar
ticle of commerce in the East, because in its properties    superior          it  is

burning, or as oleaginous condiments, in Asiatic countries.
    2. Observations on a New Species              of British Gurnard, and
           on a Species of Sole new to Science.            By Richard Par-
           nell, M.D.      Communicated by Mr Stark.
    The author obtained, in the early part of last September, at
Brixham, in Devonshire, seven specimens of a species of Gurnard,
which     has been   known for thirty years past to the fishermen there
under the name of Finned Captains.              This he ascertained to be the
 Trigla lucerna of Brunner. The species is known as an inhabitant
of the Mediterranean,        where    it was first noticed by Rondeletius,
but mistaken by him for the T. cuculus of Linnaeus.               Since then,
Brunner noticed it at Marseilles, Risso at Nice, Leach at Malta,
and Cuvier at Naples       ;  but it had not been previously observed by
any naturalist on the British coasts. The largest specimen ob
tained by the author is 10J inches long. The back is light red,
the pectoral fins dark blue, the sides marked by a silvery band from
the gill-cover to the tail ; the lateral line smooth, and formed by
numerous semicircular        plates, beautifully radiated at their free mar
 gin ;  the scales thin, large, and entire     ;  the second ray of the first
 dorsal fin very long, so as to reach, when folded down, beyond the
 sixth ray of the second dorsal fin. (See Plate.)
    From the     same source, the author obtained        at the same   time a
 small species    of sole, which he believes to be entirely new to na
 turalists,   and which he proposes to designate Monochirus minulus.
 It  is five inches long, shaped like a sole, but narrower towards the
 tail.    The back is reddish-brown ; the pectoral fin on the eye-side
 is tipped with black, but the opposite one is white and rudimentary.
 The dorsal fin commences over the upper lip, and extends down the
 back to the caudal rays        ;  and every sixth or seventh ray      of the
 dorsal and anal fins is black.       The number of fin rays is 73 dorsal,
 54 anal, 4 ventral, 4 pectoral, and 14 caudal.          The scales are small,
 with from 12 to 15 denticles at their free margin. — The Monochirus
 linffula, or red-backed     sole, is the only species with which this fish
 might be apt to be confounded.           But they differ in the red-backed
 sole presenting a distinct interval between the dorsal and caudal
 fins, a white fringing of the tail, and upon the anal and dorsal fins
 six or seven blackish spots, that extend beyond the base of the rays
 towards the body of the fish.          This little sole is not unfrequently
 taken in the trawl-nets by the fishermen of Brixham, but on account
  of their diminutive size they are seldom brought          on shore.

    3. On    Aplanatic Telescopes,         a posthumous paper by the late
          Archibald Blair, Esq.              Communicated by Professor
          Forbes.
    In this paper     a new  fluid composition is proposed for correcting
 chromatic aberration,     free from the corrosive properties of those
 used by the author's father       Dr Blair, the inventor of the fluid ob
ject-glass.     The composition proposed is : —
          Saturated solution muriate of lime,        .      .    40 parts
                              nitrate of lime,        .     .    20    ...
          Strongest acetic acid                                   2    ...
    The secondary spectrum formed by the nitrate, combined with
crown-glass, is similar to that when flint and crown glass are com
bined.     The combination of crown-glass with the muriate is the
opposite.     Hence,     by properly combining these, Mr Blair states
that the secondary spectrum may be wholly destroyed.

      The following Communications were read        :
   1.  On the Condition of the Earth, as it is first described in
          the Mosaic    Account of the Creation.         By Mungo
          Ponton, Esq.
   In this paper, the author confined his attention principally to

                                             160
those words of the original, which,                in the received translation, are
rendered " without form and void.''    He considered that, in a phi
lological point of view, the  most  correct translation is " vastness
and emptiness," or, in the adjective form, " immeasurable and im
ponderable."
   The bearing of the most recent philosophical discoveries, and of
the opinions of natural philosophers and geologists, upon the inter
pretation     of this   passage,      formed   the next subject of inquiry.            It
was stated that there are three prevailing opinions in regard to the
Mosaic account of creation, arising out of three different views with
respect to the period when those strata were formed                          which con
tain organic remains.             One opinion       is,   that these strata were form
ed at   period altogether antecedent to the events described in the
        a
second and succeeding verses of Genesis.   A second opinion is, that
the strata were formed                during the very epoch embraced in the
Mosaic narrative        ;   and   a   third, that they were formed subsequent
to that epoch.          In both of the latter views, the description of the
state   of the earth     is   considered     as applicable        to its original condi
tion when first created.              The author     seems     to lean to the second
opinion, and infers         that the primitive condition             of the earth was
probably gaseous.
  2.    On the Result of Experiments on the Weight, Height,
         and Strength, of above 800 individuals. By Professor
            Forbes.
   These experiments were made upon students in the University
of Edinburgh, chiefly between the ages of 14 and 25, and were in
tended to illustrate the general inquiry as to the law of physical
development with age, but more particularly to afford data for in
stituting comparisons between different nations.                      For this purpose,
throughout      these experiments,           natives      of Scotland, England, and
Ireland, were distinguished            ;   and though the numbers belonging to
the two latter countries were comparatively                    small, still the general
coincidence     of results,       as to the three elements           of weight, height,
and strength, gives some confidence                 even     in   that part of the in
quiry.
  The weights           were expressed         in pounds including clothes        ;   the
heights in inches, including shoes             ;   the strength was determined in
pounds by Regnier's dynamometer.

                                            161
     All    these data for different         ages were          expressed by projection
upon ruled paper, and interpolating                   curves used to deduce the mean
results, which were then tabulated.                       A   comparison was instituted
with M. Quetelet's conclusions, from experiments on a similar class
of individuals in Belgium.   The following deductions were made :
   1. That, in respect of weight, height, and strength, there is a
general coincidence             in the form      of the curves with those of M.
Quetelet.
     2.    In Britain, the progress towards maturity                    seems   greater in
the earlier      years (14 to 17) than in Belgium, and slower after
wards.        This seems more strongly indicated in the English than in
the Scotch curves.
     The superior physical development of natives of this country
     3.
above the Belgians is very marked.  In strength it is greatest (£th
of the whole)        ;   in height least.
     4. So far as the English and             Irish curves        can   be considered as
correct, they indicate that the English are the least developed of
the natives of Britain at a given age, the Irish most, the Scotch
retaining an intermediate place.
   5. The maximum height is barely attained at the age of 25.
   6. All the developments increase during the period of observa
tion (14 to 26 years of age), and all increase more slowly as age
increases.       Hence the curves are all convex upwards, (the                   abscissa;
or   ages    being projected horizontally).
     8. Description           of a Single Achromatic Eye-Glass.                  By Ed
            ward Sang, Esq.
  The author observes that, " in combining the surfaces of an
achromatic eye-piece, a very limited question is resolved.     The
condition   that pencils of light falling upon the first surface in
               is,
directions parallel [approximately] to the axis                     of the instrument,
emerge from the last surface in such                  a   way, that the different rays
into which each          is   decomposed may be parallel            among themselves.
On account of this restriction, achromatism                     can be obtained by the
use of only one medium, and           unnecessary to combine sub
                                            it   is
stances     acting differently on the light            of various colours."
  The author then proceeds to show that, since the only required
conditions are that two refractions shall take place of   certain               a
amount and at certain distances, these conditions may be fulfilled

                                   162
by two refracting surfaces,  or by    a  single lens of a certain thick
ness.
   The author computes the relations of the radii of curvature of
such a lens, and the interval between its surfaces, so as to fulfil —
1. the condition  of achromatism    ;   and, 2. that of the whole light
entering the object-glass being received also by the eye.        This se
cond condition determines the radii in the ratio      of the line of in
cidence to the line of refraction.     The correction for sphericity can
not be also included on this construction.

    The following Communications were read               :
    1.   On the Action of Disintegrated Surfaces of Crystals upon
            Light. By Sir D. Brewster.
    In this paper the author commences with a summary of the pre
sent state of knowledge as to the internal constitution of crystalline
bodies    ; and he then proceeds to describe the optical figures pro
duced by the disintegrated surfaces of minerals and artificial mine
rals, according as the disintegration       is elfected — 1.  By the action of
solvents while the crystal is forming, or remains in the bowels of
the earth     ; 2. By the action of solvents on the surface of perfect
crystals ; and 3.     By mechanical abrasion. The crystals of the first
denomination       he has examined     are Brazil topaz, white fluor-spar,
hornblende, axinite, boracite, oxidulated         iron, dodecahedral garnet,
diamond, and amethyst.           The perfect crystals which     he found best
fitted    for presenting    the phenomena he describes are alum, fluor
spar, and calcareous spar.         The facts related in this paper consist
of a description of a      great variety of optical appearances, of which
it is impossible to give      an abstract.
    2.   Observations on the Pulsation of the Heart and Arteries.
            By Dr Knox.
    The author here first describes briefly what           has  been done by
previous physiologists towards determining the differences produced
on the pulse by varieties in posture, by digestion, by age, by stature,
by the period of the day, and by muscular motion.               He then pro
ceeds to relate the particulars of many new observations he has him
self made upon       these and other   points connected with the circum
stances     which  influence the rate   of the heart's contractions.       The
 general results are, that in his opinion the pulse is more frequent
 in the morning than at any other period of the day, abstracting the
 effect of stimuli ; that the heart is more excitable at the same pe
 riod  ;  that the pulse is depressed by cold ; that it is excited by mus
 cular   exertion,  and more in the weak than in the strong, and also
 more by exercise carried to fatigue than by moderate exercise ; that
 it is most frequent in the young, and least frequent in the old         ; and
 that great varieties     are produced     by differences    in posture, those
 positions of the body occasioning the greatest excitement which re
 quire most muscular effort for their maintenance.

Brief Outlines illustrative of the Alterations in the House of Com

       The following communications were read                :
   1.   On an Expression for the effort required to Ascend Planes
          of Different Inclinations.         By Professor Forbes.
   The author states that, whilst it      has been    preUy generally agreed
by authors     on  animal    mechanics     that tin:    measure of muscular
effort is generally    expressed by the weight multiplied by the verti
cal height through which it is raised, it is clear that this cannot be
universally true,    i-ince, in the  particular   case  of horizontal   motion,
no vertical    height can be obtained      ; and, when the ascent is verti
cal, it is very unlikely that the same advantage of ascent should be
obtained as at lower angles.
   The author proposes, by          a formula,     to represent the length    of

                                       150
path described     by an average muscular effort at a given angular
ascent in a given time, and which, multiplied by the sine of that
angle,  will give the vertical height gained.
   Direct experiments      are quoted, to shew the uniformity of verti
cal ascent within the usual limits, viz. between 12° and 25°.         From
the known results     of tread-mill experiments, it is supposed that the
diminution   of effective action at    a vertical  ascent is not very consi
derable, but may yet amount to about 1100 feet per hour             ; whilst
about 20°, the effective action, will be nearly 1 500 feet per hour.
 The horizontal action is estimated at about four miles per hour.
The following formula sufficiently represents extensive experiments
at various angles of ascent, h — height ascended in English feet in
 an hour, at an angle «    : —

    2. Observations on some New Species of British Fishes.               By
         Dr Parnell.
   The author stated that     a species   of sturgeon, for which he has pro
 posed the name     of Acipenser latirostris, as characteristic of the spe
cies, is occasionally met with in the Frith of Forth, in the Solway
Frith and in the Tay. It is called by the fishermen the Broad-nosed
Sturgeon, to distinguish it from the Acipenser sturio, or sharp-nosed
species.    The length, in general, seven feet ; weight, about eight
stone.    The colour of the head, back, and sides, is of an olive-grey ;
the belly dirty white.       The body is armed with five rows of osseous
shields, extending     from the head to the tail. The first row runs
down the central ridge of the back.           The two next rows arise one
on each side of the former, and immediately on the lower margin of
the pectorals the other two rows commence.               The dorsal shields
are but very slightly carinated,        the fifth being the highest in the
series.
    The  nose   is broad and depressed,        the point of which is larger
than the diameter     of the mouth.       On the under surface of the snout
are four cirri, situated much nearer the tip of the snout than to the
upper lip.    The central plates on the summit of the head are beau
tifully radiated, and of a fibrous appearance. The whole skin is
rough, with a number of small angular osseous plates intermixed
with very minute spicula.        The position of the pectoral fins is the
same as in other sturgeons.

                                         151
     This   fish differs from the     Acipenser sturio, the only other British
species of sturgeon,         in having     the extremity    of the snout much
 broader than the diameter of the mouth, — the keel of the dorsal
plates but slightly elevated, — and the cirri situated much nearer to
the tip of the nose than to the upper lip.              For  a representation   of
the head see the accompanying             Plate.   No. I.
                      Gobins unipunctatus.          (Parnell.)
    This species of Goby is common on the coast of Devon, rare in
the Solway Frith, and occasionally met with in the Frith of Forth-
 It grows to three inches and a half in length. The back is of a
reddish-brown        crossed with a few short dark lines        ; the belly, ven
tral and anal fins, are of a pure white.           The first dorsal fin is com
posed of six rays, the second of eleven rays, the last rays being
shorter than the first.         The tail is even at the end. Between the
fifth and sixth ray of the first dorsal fin is a large dark spot which
is always constant ; from which circumstance the author has pro
posed the name of unipunctatus.              This fish perhaps is nearer allied
to the Gobius minutus than to any other ; but the dark spot on the
firstdorsal, and the tail being even at the end, will readily distin
guish it.
                           Gobius ulbus.       (Parnell.)
    This fish,   in the month      of June, is common in the Solway Frith,
and is evidently the fry of a large species.            Its length is about two
inches.       The body nearly transparent ; the head large ; the gape
wide ; the teeth small and sharp, placed in one row in each jaw.
The numbers of the fin rays are — first dorsal 5 ; second dorsal 13 ;
ventral 13; anal 13; caudal 12.                 The terminating rays of the
second dorsal and anal fins are the longest.             The presence of only
five rays in the first dorsal fin is sufficient to distinguish          this fish
from every other of the same genus.
    The accompanying plate No. I. represents the two new species
together with the other species of Gobius previously distinguished.
Dr Parnell at         the same time exhibited           several   specimens    of
    fishes hitherto unnoticed on the coast            of Scotland.

   1.  On the power of the Periosteum to form new bone.                    By
      Professor Syme.
   The object of the author in this paper         is to state certain obser
vations and experiments by which he consid«rs it to be clearly es
tablished, that the periosteal membrane, covering the bones, has the

                                         154
power      of secreting osseous substance and of forming              new bony
matter.
    Duhamel,      founding     on a false analogy, which       he supposed     to
exist between       the periosteum and the bone on the one hand, and
the bark and wood of trees on the other, was the first to lay down
distinctly the theory that bony matter is formed by the investing
membrane of the bones.                The experiments and observations of
Haller and others on the progress of ossification in young animals
were believed, however, to militate              against this idea, and tended
rather to establish the doctrine, that new bony matter is formed by
the pre-existing or old bone.               Between     these two theories, the
 opinions of physiologists        and surgeons      are still pretty equally di
 vided.
     The author was lately induced to suspect, from the circumstances
 of a case of necrosis, that the theory of Duhamel is the true one.
 In   a case   of inflammation of the tibia consequent on an injury and
 terminating in death, of nearly the whole of that bone, amputation
 became necessary at the close of five weeks after the accident.              On
 examining       the   amputated      limb,  the  periosteum   of  the  tibia was
  found chequered with patches of osseous substance adhering to its
 inner surface, and covered with a delicate membrane.                 This obser
  vation    led him to subject       the question to the test     of experiment,
  which he conceives         he has   accomplished     in the following manner.
   An incision was made in the fore leg of a dog, and a portion of the
  radius, about two inches long, was removed along with its invest
  ing membrane.           In the other fore leg the same operation was per
  formed, with the exception that the periosteum was carefully dis
  sected from the portion of bone which it was intended to remove,
  and two inches of bone were cut out, its membrane being thus left
   entire.     In six weeks the animal was killed ; when it was found
   that a large     vacuity was left in the radius, where the membrane
   was removed as well          as the portion    of bone   ; while in the other,
   where     the membrane       had been left, the gap was entirely filled np
   by firm osseous texture, and at this part of the radius the bone was
   even thicker than elsewhere.             The experiment     was several times
   repeated with the same result.             In another dug the periosteum of
   the radius was carefully dissected off as before, but without either
   disturbing the position of the membrane or removing the subjacent
   portion    of bone   ;  and a thin metallic     plate was passed around      the
    bone between it and the detached             periosteum.    In six week the

                                    155
animal    was killed and the limb examined.         The inner surface of
the membrane presented an        extensive deposition of osseous matter
between it and the metallic plate     ;  while between the plate and the
bone there was merely       a membranous      formation without any new
bony substance whatever.

     On the Action of Voltaic         Electricity on Pyroxylic Spirit,
           and on Solutions in Water, Alcohol, and Ether.                 By
           Arthur Connell, Esq.
     The author    has found a perfect resemblance to     exist between the
  appearances presented by      pyroxylic   spirit (Bihydrate of Methyline
  of Dumas and Peligot) under voltaic agency, and those which he
  had previously    observed in regard to alcohol     ; a coincidence  which
 was to be expected, from the interesting analogy existing between
 these two liquids in other respects.
     The pyroxylic spirit, after three distillations from quicklime, had
 a specific gravity of 801 at 62° F., and boiled in contact with mer
 cury at 140° F., under a pressure of 29.5 inches. The leading
 facts observed were the following       : —
    Minute quantities of acid, alkaline, and saline bodies, when dis-
 solved with rectified pyroxylic spirit, favoured the voltaic action,
 by increasing the conducting power of the liquid.             When it held
 in solution   j}5 of pure potash, and was submitted to the agency of
 thirty-six pairs of four-inch plates in a tube with parallel platinum
 foil poles, hydrogen was given off from the negative pole, while no
gas proceeded       from the positive   pole.     A ten thousandth    part of
potash had a marked effect in promoting this action.
    When the pure spirit was submitted in a similar tube to the
agency of seventy-two pairs of four-inch plates, hydrogen             was in
like manner evolved, although in smaller quantity.
    When    th'* same electric current was passed through the spirit and
through water, each      holding dissolved jj0 part of potash, the quan
tity of hydrogen evolved from both negative poles was the same.
    Besides the evolution of elastic fluid, there were found in the
liqnid acted on small quantities of such substances as often result
from the oxidation of analogous liquids, such as resinous matter ;
and, where the quantity        of dissolved potash was considerable, a
speedy precipitation of carbonate of potash ensued, the liquid at
the same time acquiring a red colour from the formation of resinous
matter.
    In the whole circumstances it was concluded,         as had been done

                                     157
 in regard to alcohol, that water, entering as such into the constitu
 tion  of pyroxylic spirit,  is resolved    under voltaic   agency into its
 elements, its hydrogen    being evolved at the negative pole, and its
 oxygen employed      in giving rise to the secondary effects of oxida
 tion.
    As pyroxylic ether (hydrate of methyline of D. and P.) bears
 the gaseous form, no galvanic experiments were attempted with it;
 but, as the author had formerly observed no evidence of the pre
 sence  of water in sulphuric     ether under electric    agency, he is dis
 posed to adopt the analogous view as in regard          to alcohol, and to
 consider pyroxylic spirit as a hydrate of pyroxylic ether, which lat
 ter substance, like sulphuric ether, he regards not as an oxide, but
 simply as a ternary combination      of its constituents.
    The results formerly stated to the Society in proof of the secon
dary origin of chlorine or iodine, when aqueous solutions of the cor
responding     hydracids  and haloid      salts are submitted    to voltaic
agency, have been confirmed with stronger voltaic powers, the only
difference   being, that the chlorine     or iodine, and also the corre
sponding hydracid, from the secondary decomposition of which, by
nascent oxygen, the chlorine or iodine proceeds, are sooner carried
over from the negatively electrified solution into the positively
electrified water, than when smaller        powers are employed.        The
decomposition of binoxide     of iodine in an aqueous solution of starch,
has also been ascertained, by analogous methods, to be a secondary
action.
    The appearances presented during the electric decomposition of
alcoholic solutions of acids, alkalies, and salts, have been found to be
very analogous to those observed in the corresponding         aqueous solu
tions, the principal difference being, that the oxygen of the decom
posed water of the alcohol rarely appears at the positive          pole, for
reasons formerly explained.         An ordinary oxyacid salt dissolved
in alcohol is slowly resolved, under voltaic action, into its constituent
acid and base, with evolution       of hydrogen at the negative pole ;
and, where the base is not     of difficult reduction, a portion of it is
reduced by the hydrogen.       By experiments conducted       on principles
exactly analogous to those with aqueous solutions, it was found
that the appearance of iodine at the positive pole, in an alcoholic
solution of iodide of potassium, is a secondary effect due to nascent
oxygen.
    By instituting  a comparison    between    the electric action on alco

                                     158
holic and on aqueous solutions of chlorides         and iodides, under cir
cumstances in which no secondary actions could take place at the
poles, the appearances led to the conclusion, that these salts are not
dissolved as such in water, but as muriates and hydriodates.            The
solution was placed in a tube connected by means of asbestus with
two other tubes containing distilled water, the positive pole being
introduced into one   of the tubes containing water, and the negative
into the other.    When an alcoholic solution of a chloride or iodide
was in the outer tube, no acid was observed          to be produced in the
alcoholic solution, but only at the point of contact between the solu
tion and the water.     On the other hand, when an aqueous solution
was employed, a plentiful     production of the corresponding hydracid
was observed in that solution on its positive side.          These appear
ances are exactly those which ought to be observed,           if we suppose
chlorides   and iodides   to be dissolved    as such in absolute alcohol,
and as muriates and hydriodates       in water.      In none of these  cases
was chlorine or iodine produced, except at the positive pole in the
positive water, by a secondary action on the corresponding hydracid.
    When etherial solutions of various substances, such as potash,
chromic acid, and metallic chlorides, are submitted to galvanic          ac
tion, there is no symptom     of decomposition either of the solvent or
of the dissolved body.     Thus no exception has yet been met with
to the general conclusion, " That when solutions of binary combina
tions of elementary bodies in water, alcohol, or ether, are submit
ted to voltaic agency, the dissolved      substance is not decomposed,
but only the solvent,   if  itself an electrolyte."     A  few cases, how
ever, comprehended within the law still remain to be experiment
ally investigated.

   1. Geological     Observations on Binny-Cragin       West-Lothian,
         by Charles Maclaren, Esq.
   Binny Crag in West Lothian is of compact greenstone, about half
a mile in length, and from twenty to one hundred and forty feet in
breadth.     It extends smith  and north, and has a small ravine on its
west side, above which the highest part of the crag rises about two

                                                160
hundred feet.         Three phenomena connected with this crag are wor
thy of observation.         1.     It has the character of a           trap vein which has rup
tured   the   strata in   a fluid state.       The dip of the sedimentary rocks on
its west side is to west-south- west, on the east side to the east, and
in both cases at a pretty high angle.                  We have here, therefore, evi
dence of the strata having been ruptured, and a fissure formed ; and
we have the trap, the rupturing agent, placed on the fissure, and
occupying the anticlinal                  line, or axis of the upheaving movement.
According to the received hypothesis respecting the origin of trap,
we might expect this appearance to be common, and yet it is rather
rare.       It forms the exception, while it ought apparently to                        be the
rule.       2. The trap hns mingled with the shale, and affected its struc
ture in     a very remarkable manner.   It has enveloped portions of the
shale within its          mass, and penetrated laterally among the beds to
the extent of one          hundred feet or more on the east side.  On tho
south flank of the highest part           of the crag we have a section exhi
biting the relations           of the two rocks. The trap has the form of an
arch,   of perhaps twenty feet radius, with                        a long straight      tabular
mass about three feet              farther to the     east.     A       mass   of shale lies   un
der the arch exhibiting              a    laminar structure        ;    in the portions conti
guous to the trap, its substance is hardened, and the planes of the
laminae, instead of being straight and parallel, are arranged concen
trically with the curved surface of the trap which covers them.
 Portions of shale also lie under and above the thin tabular project
ing mass of trap, and these likewise conform themselves to its sur
face.       The inference           is,   that, independently            of the original slaty
form of the shale,         a   secondary laminar structure was induced                       upon
it,    by   the heat of the fused trap being propagated through                         it   pro
gressively and unequally, each portion as                     it       was dried and harden
ed, separating         from that beyond it.            8.     The crag exhibits a striking
example          of lite effects denudation.
                                   of          The north end of the ridge,
which       is   low, and on a level with the surface of the land westward,
has merely had its covering                  of shale stripped          off, and exhibits a few
trifling indentations          ;   but the south end, which rises in bold relief
above the adjacent land, has been cut into seven distinct hillocks,
separated by transverse ravines, which are steep in the sides, and
from ten to sixty feet iu depth.  The appearance of these ravines
shews, that they must have been cut by powerful currents                                flowing
from the west.

   2. Notice      of Experimental Researches into the Laws of cer
          tain Hydrodynamical Phenomena that have not hitherto
          been reduced into Conformity with known Laws.                   By
          John Scott Russell, Esq. Lecturer on Natural Philoso
          phy.
   This Paper contained the results of researches in hydrodyna
mics extending       over a period  of two years, and which     the author is
continuing to prosecute under the auspices of the British Associa
tion in conjunction with Mr Robison, the Secretary of this So
ciety.    The present paper contained the development of two new
laws in hydrodynamics, which appeared of sufficient importance to
form a paper by themselves.
   These two laws are,
       1. The Law of Emergence — as an Element of Resistance.
       2.  The Law of the Wave — as an Element of Resistance.
   The state of our knowledge in hydrodynamics is well known to
be very imperfect in comparison with the other departments of Na
tural Philosophy.        Mr Challis, in his Report to the British Asso
ciation on the present state of hydrodynamics,             remarks,  that his
review may serve to shew that this department of science is in an
extremely imperfect state, and that possibly it may on that account
be the more      likely to receive improvement      ; and he adds, that a sin
gular fact relating to the resistance of bodies, partjy immersed in
water, has been observed, viz. that a boat drawn on a canal with a
velocity of more than four or five miles an hour rises perceptibly
out of the water, making the resistance less than if no such effect
took place    ; and he further observes, that though theory never pre
dicted any thing      of that kind, it may probably soon      be able to ac
count for it on known mechanical          principles.    Professor Whewell
makes the same avowal. and the Institute of France have made it
the subject of their prize for three years without having obtained a
solution of the difficulties with which this part of Natural Philoso
phy is beset.
   There is one law well established by the labours of Newton,
 Bernoulli, Euler, D'Alembert, and their followers, that the resist
ance   of a fluid to a body moving in      it is proportioned  to the square
of the velocity.
   This law holds in      a great variety   of instances, for vessels or ob
jects wholly immersed in the fluid.

                                        162
     The law of the square of      the velocity  does not hold except in n
 few instances, and in peculiar       circumstances,    as regards resistance
 of fluids to the motion of floating bodies.        If the  water   be not very
 deep, and if the velocity be more than three or four miles an hour,
 the deviation will become exceedingly striking. The following are
causes    of the deviation :
     I. An Emergence of the floating body from the fluid takes
place at all velocities. This emergence is produced by the velocity
of the body.       When at rest the body, in virtue of the force of gra
vitation, displaces a portion of fluid equal to its own weight ; but if
it  be moved    it will require to displace a greater and greater por
tion of fluid in a given time.            Now the force of gravity acting
downwards on the body is constant force, and the force with
which the fluid must      be displaced is an increasing one ; by comparing
these two quantities together the following result is obtained —
                           ¦— M1-*}*
     Where    R is the resistance, s the transverse section      of statical dis
placement, v the velocity of the body, g the measure of gravity, and
{
   the density of the fluid, and by differentiating we find R a maxi-
                      4 g
mum, when       r = -y and the immersion = 0 when v = 2g.
    IT. The Wave of the fluid interferes with the resistance. Those
portions of a fluid which are thrown aside by the prow of a vessel
form Waves.         These waves are propagated in the direction of the
motion of the vessel.
    The wave of     a fluid moves with     a velocity   which    is nearly uni
form.
    The velocity of the wave is dependent solely upon the depth of
the fluid, reckoning from the summit of the wave.              It is quite inde
pendent     of the width of the channel.         It  is quite independent      of
the velocity of the vessel which creates the waves.            The velocity of
the wave is equal to that which would be acquired by a body fall
ing freely by gravity through a space equal to half the depth of the
fluid.
    The resistance of     a fluid at a given velocity is intimately    connect
ed    with the velocity of the wave in the fluid.
     When the velocity of the floating body is          less than that    of the
wave, the effect     of the wave      is to increase the resistance       of the
 fluid.

                                      168
    When the velocity of the floating body is greater than that of
the wave, the effect of the wave is to diminish the resistance of the
fluid.
    The manner in Which the wave increases the resistance opposed
to a fluid, is by increasing the immersion of the anterior part of the
solid, by raising the front and leaving the stern depressed in the
hollow behind the wave, so that the transverse section of resistance
has an increment      of area in the ratio of the rise of the elevation.
     The manner in which the wave diminishes the resistance at velo
 cities not less than that   of the wave, is by falling behind the stern,
 so as to raise a   portion of the vessel equal to itself above the mean
level of the fluid, thus diminishing the anterior section presented to
the vessel.
     At all velocities greater than that of the wave, the displaced
fluid falls behind the prow, and forms a compound wave, on the
 ridge of which the vessel is carried along with diminished anterior
 immersion.
     These doctrines receive illustration from the navigation of shal
 low rivers and canals, and are applicable to the improvement of in
 land transport by water.

   The following communications were read                    :
   1.   On the Constitution of the Earth's Atmosphere in Remote
          Geological Epochs.             By Professor Johnston, Durham.
   This is the first paper of a promised series on the subject here
announced.        In the present paper the author endeavours to shew,
that in remote epochs the atmosphere was more extensive and heav
ier than it is now, that it contained           a greater absolute quantity      of
oxygen, and that this quantity has gradually diminished up to our
own era, and is probably            still undergoing     a   sensible diminution.
His views are founded partly on speculative considerations, of
which it is not possible to give a sufficiently circumstantial abridg
ment, and partly on the evidence of various operations going on at
or near the surface of the earth, the tendency of which must, on the
whole, apparently        be to diminish       the quantity      and proportion   of
the oxygen      in the atmosphere.           In addition     to the ordinary and
well known       causes    of deterioration,     the author     points out a new
source    of diminution to which his attention           has   been lately drawn.
 From experiments made upon the aeriform fluid discharged                     from

                                         166
the    earth during an       inundation,     and obviously expelled    by the
water penetrating       to a considerable depth, and displacing the gases
contained in the soil, he found that this gaseous matter consists of
2.5 per cent, carbonic acid, 12.764 oxygen, and 84.736 nitrogen.
Taking this observation in conjunction with many others previously
made on the composition of the gaseous discharges in volcanic dis
tricts, and tha gaseous contents of mineral waters, he infers that a
process of oxidation is constantly going on at various depths below
the earth's surface, the oxygen for which is in all probability de
rived by absorption of the atmospheric           gases at the surface.
    2.  An Account of         a New Species       of British Bream, and a
           Species of Skate new to Science ; with a List of, and
           Observations on, the Fishes of the Frith of Forth and
           Neighbourhood.          By Richard Parnell, M.D., F.R.S.E.
    The author stated that, in July last, he obtained from tho Frith
of Forth a species of Bream, which he believes to be the Pagellus
 acarne of Cuvier.        Length       13 inches ; depth 4 inches ; head one-
 third the length of the body not including         the tail-fin. General form
 resembling     that  of the Sea Bream, but not         so deep in  proportion
 to its length.    Scales large ; 70 forming the lateral line, 6£ in an ob
 lique  row   between    it and the first ray of the dorsal-fi:i.    Anterior-
 teeth small and numerous, disposed in many rows ; outer row com
 posed of 30 teeth, longer and more bent than those within ; mo
 lars large, disposed in three rows in each jaw.
     D 12-12,    P  16, V8, A 3-11,       C. 20. Body pale silvery red. Dor
 sal and caudal fins rose-red        ; ventral and anal fins paler.   Between
 the eyes reddish-brown        ; in front of the eyes and on the lower half
 of the preoperculum, metallic grey ; on the upper part of the base
 of each pectoral fin, a deep violet-coloured spot, very conspicuous
 even in the dried state.         (See Plate II.)
     It differs from the Sea Bream in the eye being smaller, the mo
 lars much larger, and in having a dark spot at the base of the pecto
 rals, which the Sea Bream never possesses.
     It differs from the Spanish Bream in having the origin of the la
 teral straight, whereas in the Spanish Bream it is suddenly bent           ; in
 the eyes being larger      ; and in presenting the pectoral spot, which is
  never found in the other Bream.
     The species of Skate, to which Dr Parnell            has proposed the spe

                                       167
ci6c name of intermedia, is stated by him to be not uncommon in the
Frith of Forth.        Length    2 feet; body thin ; snout sharp and pro
minent ; tail rather short, with a row of spines placed on the me
sial line only, not extending further up than to the base of the anal
fins.     Body perfectly smooth on both sides ; eyes rather small, with
a  spine placed in front of each ; teeth small, not so sharp as in the
grey skate.       Body above, dark olive-green ; on the under-surface
dark grey, with minute specks of a deeper colour.            (See Plate II.)
    It is distinguished from R. batis by the nose being longer ; the
first dorsal fin being more remote from the second, and the skin
on the back being perfectly smooth, which in the         R. balis is covered
with small spicula and rough to the touch.
    It  is at once removed      from the  R. Oxyrhynchus of Montagu, by
the under-surface       of the body being of    a dark grey-colour   ; which
part in the    R. Oxyrhynchus      is perfectly white.
    Dr Parnell mentioned the names of 123 species of fishes found
in the Frith of Forth and neighbourhood, about 40 of which have
been added by himself from personal observation.             Three of   these
are new to Science and two new to Britain.
    3. Notice on the Composition           of the Right Prismatic Ba
            ryto Calcite, the Bicalcareo-carbonate of Baryta of Dr
            Thomson.        By Professor Johnston, Durham.
    This mineral,     as described by the author about     two years ago in
the London and Edinburgh Philosophical             Journal,  presents a new
and very interesting example of the principle known to crystallo-
graphers by the name of dimorphism ; having the same chemical
constitution    as the   well known Baryto Calcite of Brooke, but hav
ing a form belonging to an entirely different system of crystalliza
tion.      In Dr Thomson's System of Mineralogy lately published,
 however, it is described as a mineral species before unknown, hav
ing   a  composition    different from that of every known mineral, and
is therefore     distinguished    by the name of the Bicalcareo carbonuU
of Baryta.
    To test his former analysis, the author re-examined the mineral
 from     the only two known localities : he analyzed also the Baryto
 C'ulcite of Brooke, and the results are embodied in the following
 Table : —

   From these results the author concludes, that in describing the
mineral, Dr Thomson must have been under some misapprehension
in regard to its true composition,            and consequently that           the name
he has   imposed upon it must        be laid aside.

       Sir T. M. BRISBANE, Bart,           President, in the Chair.
      The following Communications were read : —
     1. On the     Food of the Herring and Salmon.           By John
           Stark, Esq.
     The author of this paper, after some preliminary observations,
  arranged his remarks under the following heads: — 1. On the food
  and sex of the Vendace of Lochmaben.         2. On the food of the
  Herring (Clupea Harengus, Lin.)       And, 3, On the food of the Sal
  mon (Salmo salar, Lin.)
     1. As to the food of the Vendace ( Coregonus Lavaretus, Fleming),
 he observed, that fishes in lakes, and feeding on animal food, must
 necessarily subsist on the small aquatic animals found in these lakes:
 That there is no reasonable analogy between the vendace and the
 herring, because they live in different mediums, the one in salt, the
 other in fresh water ; and that their food cannot, therefore, be the
 same, none of the animals upon which fishes feed being common to
both   : That, besides, they are of different natural families : That
writers on natural history state the animalcules which are found in
the stomach of the vendace, and the other minute animals found

                                          170
   in lakes, to form the food     of fresh-water fishes generally   ; and that
   Leeuwenhoeck       had even figured the identical animal found        in the
   stomach   of the vendace in     1833 more than 130 years before, stating
   that it and the other minute animals in similar localities, formed the
   food of the larger fishes.
      Regarding the     sexes  of the vendace, the author did not consider
  the necessity    of a male parent required to be proved.
      2.  Food of the Herring. — The author stated, that the food of the
  herring    was  known and described from personal examination by
  Neucrantz,     previous to the year 1654 ; by Leeuwenhoeck in 1696 ;
  by Fabricius in 1781; by Miiller in 1785; by Bloch about the
  same period; by Lacepede and Latreille in 1798; by the Rev. Dr
  Scoresby in 1820; by Pennant and others; and, in fact, is men
  tioned by every writer who treats          of the natural history of fishes :
  And that what      has been stated by all authors on the subject      of the
 herring's food, is corroborated          by the examination of the stomach
 and intestinal canal     of that fish, and by the specimens      on the table
 of the Society.
     3.  Food and Reproduction of the Salmon        — The    author stated on
 this head, what had been        remarked by the most esteemed authors
 on natural    history to form the food of the salmon ; and exhibited
preparations by Dr Parnell, confirming the statements of these
writers.      He next noticed the valuable evidence taken before a
 Committee of Parliament in 1824 and 1825, regarding the food and
natural history of the salmon, which also corroborated the state
ments     of systematic writers     ;  and remarked, that when these fishes
prey upon animals in roe, the ova often remain in the stomach and
intestinal    canal, when the other portions       of the food are wholly di
gested.      He next gave     an abstract    of the evidence before the Par
liamentary     Committee,     as to   the periods of the ascent of the salmon
in the different rivers for the purpose of spawning, and the descent
of the fry to the sea ; and pointed out the experiments made on the
development of the ova by Mr John Hogarth junior, as detailed in
the appendix to the Report of the Committee,            — and  those made by
Mr Schonberg, and recorded in Sir David Brewster's Journal of
Science.
     2.  Dr Barry     made some verbal remarks on the             Physiology
           of the Protem Anguinus.

    The following Communications          were read   :
     1. Remarks      on the Ossiferous Caves of Cefn, in Denbigh
           shire.  By Professor Traill.
    These caves, which were first described by the present Bishop
 of Norwich in 1832, and have since been more fully explored by
 Dr Camming of       Denbigh, were visited by the author in the autumn
 of 1837.      The principal cave is a fissure in a grand mural escarp
 ment of the mountain limestone of Wales, about two miles and
a-half south-west of St Asaph, and occurs half-way down the pre
 cipice, which seems to be about 250 feet in height.          It forms at
 that point the southern      boundary  of the limestone, which consti
 tutes the basis of the Vale of Clwyd     ; and is divided from the ex
tensive greywacke      slate formation   of that county by the narrow
picturesque Vale of Cyffredin, through which the river Elwy flows.
    The hill of Cefn consists of parallel beds of limestone, which the
extensive quarries on its southern flank shew to have a regular dip
of about 8°.      This cave was discovered in 1830 to contain earthy
 deposits exceedingly     rich in bones  of mammifera    ; and, since that
period, they have been much employed          as a manure by   Mr Lloyd,
the proprietor.       During the excavations for this purpose, many
teeth and fragments of larger bones, so entire as to be readily re
cognised, have been obtained.       An interesting collection of them is
preserved at Cefn House, and some are in the hands of the author.
Among the former, he noticed part of the humerus and        a molar tooth
of   a rhinoceros,  several teeth and bones   of the hyena, and beauti
ful teeth, and a considerable portion of the lower jaw, of a bear.
Dr Traill has in his possession two phalanges and two teeth of a
bear ; a phalanx of a large Felis, resembling the tiger ; parts of the
tibia, and of the astragalus, and    a phalanx of a large Bos   ; portions
of the metacarpus of     an immense ruminant,     apparently a deer; be
sides a variety    of fragments, not   so easily ascertained on account
of their mutilated state.
    The materials, which filled np the fissure or principal       cave  al
most to its roof, arc regularly stratified.     They formed together a
mass of earthy matter twelve feet in thickness.        The first or upper

                                      177
bed consists    of layers of clay and very fine sand, two feet thick.
The second bed is of plastic clay-roarl, containing many small wa
ter-worn pebbles, chiefly of clay-slate,        two feet thick.     The third
is a stratum so filled with broken and comminuted bones, as apparent*
ly to consist entirely of that material, two feet thick.
                                                                '
                                                                  It  is in this
bed that all the bones mentioned,           except those   of the bears, are
found.     Immediately    below is the fourth bed, consisting        of plastic
marl-clay, with many water-worn pebbles of slate and compact fel«
spar, with angular pieces of limestone ; this is also two feet thick.
The fifth bed consists of fine sand, which seldom contains any peb
bles.    It rests on the floor of the cavern, and has usually a depth
of four feet. In one part of the cave, however, Dr Gumming de
 tected below this bed a floor of hard stalagmite, about sixteen feet
square   ;  and on breaking    it up, bones of bears were found mingled
with sand and large water-worn pebbles of the rocks already men
tioned.
    One of the most interesting observations        which    occurred to the
author during his investigation       was, that the stratified earthy mate
rials filling the cave were not deposited horizontally, but had an
 evident dip, which he remarked        was in the same direction        and ap
 parent inclination   as that  of the limestone rock itself.      The impor
 tant inference   he drew from this is, that the stratified          materials
 were deposited in the cave before the limestone received its present
 position ; and he conjectured, that the animals whose remains are
 here preserved may have existed          even before the last great distur
 bances  of our carboniferous system of rocks.          Should similar phe
 nomena be observed       in other caves, it would perhaps carry back
 the existence of mammiferous         animals to geological     epochs more
 ancient than generally     supposed    ; and account for the occurrence
of diluvial materials in similar situations, without the startling sup
 position of extensive degradations of solid rocks, by causes appa.
 rently inadequate to produce them.
    Another cave exists in the same neighbourhood, in which bones
have also been found.        It is near the village of Pont Newydd. In
 its bottom was found       a collection    of hyaena  bones, in a mass of
calc-sinter and gravel, four feet in thickness.
    The author illustrated his paper by a view of the Cliffs of Cefn,
and by a plan and sections of the principal cave.

    2. Experiments        on the Growth of the        Fry of the Salmon,
          from the exclusion of the Ova to the age of seven
          months.       By Mr John Shaw.
    The author of this paper had formerly made experiments on the
 growth of the salmon fry, by procuring spawn from the river bed
 where it had been deposited by the salmon. Not considering these
experiments,    however, as entirely unobjectionable,        he procured two
fishes from the river Nith in the act of spawning         ;  and having ex
pressed the ova of the female in a convenient place, the milt of the
male fish was made to impregnate             them as nearly as possible in
imitation   of  the   natural   process.   The ova were then placed in
ponds prepared for the purpose,         and so arranged     as to exclude  all
chances   of error   as to the species,    or the nature of the progeny.
The ponds were two in number;         — one twenty-five     by eighteen feet,
— the   other fifty by thirty feet, and two feet deep.           The bottom
was thickly imbedded with gravel,           and a small stream     of spring-
water    entered    the ponds at the upper        corner,   and escaped    by
openings    at the    other end.    Both apertures were covered with         a
wire grating.     The ova in one experiment were deposited on the
20th of January 1837.         On the 10th of March (fifty days after de
position), the embryo fish were visible.            On the 27th of April
 (ninety-eight days after deposition), they were excluded from the
egg.    Specimens were exhibited at thirty days old, taken on 26th
May, measuring nearly an inch in length, and the ovum still adhe
rent.    On the 27th June, at two months old, the fry measured an
inch and a half in length     ; and on the 27th of October, at six months
old, a specimen exhibited        measured about four inches in length.
The temperature of the pond and the air was noted at the periods
of examination.       Another experiment in a different pond afforded
analogous results.       Mr Shaw is of opinion, from what he has ob
served in these and former experiments,         that the young salmon re
mains in its native stream for two years after being hatched            ; and
that the parr, or what is termed the parr in his neighbourhood,             is
the young of the salmon.

     The following Communication           was read  :
     On    the Terrestrial Mechanism          of the     Tides.     By John
            Scott Russell, Esq.
     Under the title Terrestrial Mechanism of the Tides, the author
 of this paper means to include the consideration of those causes
 which regulate the propagation of the tides, so as to exclude en
 tirely the examination of the mechanism by which they are prima
 rily produced. The generation of the tidal elevation in the Pacific
 or Atlantic Ocean is a question entirely of celestial mechanics.
  But the tides, after having been generated by solar and lunar at
  traction in a manner that      is found   to be perfectly in accordance
  with the varying intensities of these forces, do not subside at the
 instant when these forces cease to act, but continue to exist during
 a long period      of time, reaching   our shores three days after their
 birth   ; and have obeyed, during this long interval,         laws perfectly
  independent of the original influence by which they were produced,
  and presented phenomena in direct opposition to it.               They have
   obeyed the laws of terrestrial hydrodynamics.             The law of the
  propagation of the tidal wave through the ocean and around our
  shores, belongs therefore to terrestrial, not to celestial mechanics.
      Although our knowledge of the celestial mechanism of the tides
  has recently attained a high degree of accuracy, our knowledge of
  the terrestrial mechanism has been hitherto almost entirely conjec
  tural.    In the former department, the system of Bernouilli, based
  on the discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton, presents us with a theory
   of the tides in close accordance with the phenomena.           Laplace,    in

                                    180
his elaborate discussion of the tides of Brest, executed by         M. Bon-
nard, has verified this accordance to    a high degree    of precision ; and
the recent researches on the tides, by Mr Lubbock and Mr Whewell,
may be considered       as  having rendered       the  celestial  mechanics
of the tide   as perfect as any other department        of Astronomy,     the
errors of prediction being now reduced within the limits of the er
rors of observation ; so that Mr Lubbock has stated that he does
not look forward to any material       improvement      in this department
of our knowledge.
    But our acquaintance with the terrestrial mechanism of the
tides is in a very different condition.      In reference to the pheno
mena of this department, Laplace has said, in the third chapter of the
fourth book of the Mecanique Celeste, and he repeats the opinion
in the first    chapter  of the thirteenth book, at      a much later dtite,
                    "
where he says     :   Que les circonstances accessoires produisent des
varietes    considerables dans les hauteurs et dans les heures des
marces     des  ports memo    tres rapproches ;" and then he adds,       " II
est impossible de soumettre au calcul ces varietes, parceque les cir
constances dont elles dependent,       ne sont connues."       Mr Lubbock,
in like manner, speaking of the fluctuation of the establishment,
says,
        " This perplexing fluctuation presents      an insuperable obstacle
to extreme accuracy in tide predictions,        until it can be explained    ;
at present we are only left to conjecture           respecting   the cause."
 And Mr Whewell says, in 1837, " I cannot conclude this paper
without again pointing out that a great number of curious facts
in fluid motion are established in these Tide Researches, of which
it may    be hoped the theory    of hydrodynamics      will one day   be able
to render a reason."
    In 1834, the author of this paper had determined the law of the
 interference of a certain species of wave in the resistance of fluids,
 and this species of wave appeared to present very striking analo
 gies to the tide-wave.     In 1835, Mr Whewell expressed his decid
 ed conviction of their similarity, and    Mr Robison and Mr Russell
 were, in 1836, appointed      a Committee of the British Association
 to investigate the subject.     The Report of these observations         was
 given to the British Association     in 1837   ;  but as the observations
 themselves are not necessarily connected with the particular            con
 clusions   which   may be drawn      from    them, these conclusions,      at
 which the author had arrived, were made the subject of a separate
  paper to this Society.

                                       181
    The paper embraced three subjects of examination.
    I. Regarding      the true nature    of the tide wave.   — By    observations
made on the tides          of the rivers Dee (in Cheshire)          and Clyde, it
was ascertained that the tidal elevation           is a  large compound wave
consisting of a series       of elements, each of which is identical with
the wave      of the first order, or great primary wave of transla
tion,  of which the author had already determined the nature and the
laws.     The   velocity  of the tide-wave is that due to the depth of the
centre of gravity of the transverse section of the channel below
the surface.      The tide wave is a wave of translation, but the velo
city of translation of the particles is entirely different from the ve
locity of propagation of the wave, the former being variable, and
the latter constant.        When the velocity of propagation is greatest,
the velocity of translation         is often least.       The translation    takes
 place almost uniformly to the greatest depth hitherto observed.
     II.   The   application    of   our   knowledge      to the  explanation     of
the   ordinary and extraordinary         observed phenomena        of  the tide. —
 The identity of the tide-wave            with the wave of translation           af
 fords an explanation       of the following phenomena, which have hi
therto    been wholly unexplained or imperfectly understood.                   (I.)
 The dislocation of the tide by which the time of ebb is increased,
and the time      of flood diminished by propagation,          after a consider
able space.      (2.) The difference between the height of tides in
places which are adjacent,         and have been expected to have nearly
the same tides.        (3.) The variation of the establishment from time
to time, arising from changes in the dimensions and form of the
bottom     of the  sea or channels      of rivers.      (4.) The cause of the
breaking surge or tide-bar.          (5.) The variation in the form of the
curve of semi-menstrual inequality in the height and in the interval
at different places, and the exaggeration           of the other inequalities.
     III.  The deduction      of practical maxims       for  the  improvement     of
tidal  channels.  — The    last part of the paper is directed          to the de
termination      of the principles     by which tidal channels may be im
proved,     so as to facilitate   the ascent of the tide, — to increase its
volume, — to diminish the duration         of ebb, and increase that of flood-
tide, — and to impede the action of the tide in moving sand, pro
ducing bars, and injuring the banks of tidal channels or rivers.

    1.  Notice regarding the Composition of Dr James's Fever
          Powder.       By Dr Douglas Maclagau, F.R.C.S.E.
   James's Powder is a patent nostrum, which has been in use for
upwards of a century as a febrifuge.         It was avowed by its inventor
to contain antimony        ; but, as its mode     of preparation was kept

                                    181
secret, the exact state  in which the antimony existed in the powder
was not     known.     The composition of James's Powder was first
examined by      Dr George Pearson, who published his experiments
in the eighty-first volume of the Philosophical Transactions.         He
believed it to consist of 43 per cent of phosphate of lime, and 57
of peroxide of antimony.        M. Chenevix, in the Phil. Trans, for
1801, gave an account of some experiments which he had made on
James's powder, by which he found it to contain only 44 per cent,
of the oxide of antimony.         Berzelius, in his Lehrbuch, gives an
account of an examination which he had made of a specimen of the
powder.     He found that about two per cent, was soluble in water,
and this he found to consist of antimonite of lima         The remainder
he found to contain about two-thirds of the antimonious acid, which
is identical with the   oxide of   Dr Pearson, and one-third of phos
phate of lima      The London College of Physicians had, in accordance
with the views of Dr Pearson, introduced into their Pharma
copoeia an imitation of James's Powder, under the title of Pulvis
Antimonialis, which is now adopted by the other British pharma
copoeias.    This is prepared by roasting together hartshorn shavings
and black sulphuret of antimony, and the product is a mixture of
antimonious     acid  and   phosphate   of lime, as was shown     by Mr
Richard Phillips in a paper which he published in the twentieth
volume of the Annals of Philosophy.         Both these preparations are
much employed by physicians, but their operation has been fre
quently found to be very uncertain, and by many they are regarded
as quite inert.    This latter opinion, which is not in accordance with
general experience, seems to be supported by the above view of
their composition, for the antimonious acid is insoluble, even in
strong acids, and the phosphate of lime is well known to be posi
tively inert.    This, however, afforded no explanation      of the fact,
that these   powders both occasionally produce very decided effects ;
and, in order to discover the reason of this uncertainty of action,
the author was induced to make an examination of some specimens
of James's Powder and Pulvis Antimonialis.            By treating them
with boiling water, it appeared that both these powders contained
a proportion soluble in water, which consisted of antimonite of lime
and a little soluble superphosphata       The residue was acted on by
hot muriatic acid, and was found to contain antimonious         acid and
phosphate of lime in variable proportion.       By the action of sulphur
etted hydrogen on the muriatic solution,       it was shown that there
was always present a small quantity of sesqui-oxide of antimony,

                                          185
which is an active substance. The phosphate of lime was the most
constant of these ingredients, generally averaging from 50 to 54 per
cent The sesqui-oxide of antimony was the most variable of all,
there being sometimes as much as nine per cent, but in general, not
more than three or four.    The same results were obtained from
Pulvis Antimonialis, the proportion of sesqui-oxide being generally
smaller than in true James's Powder.      As it is well known that
sesqui-oxide of antimony,  at a red heat, is converted into antimoni-
ous acid,   it   seems     difficult to account for its      presence in these pre
parations, except on the supposition               that a   portion of it is united
with the phosphate of lime as a triple salt,                 and thus escapes the
action of the fire. Several specimens were                   examined of James's
Powder, prepared by Messrs Butler and by                     Messrs Newberry of
London, both of whom profess to follow the                   original    recipe of   Dr
James,   and all showed the same variability of constitution.                        The
same was found   in various samples of Pulvis Antimonialis obtained
from different druggists in Edinburgh.    From these experiments it
appeared that the uncertainty of the action of these powders was
probably owing to the variable proportion of sesqui-oxide of anti
mony which they contained, and there seemed to be nothing in the
composition of the true James's Powder to warrant the high price
at which it is sold.
   2.   Observations on the Cysticercus               Cellulosce   inhabiting the
         Human Muscles.               By Dr Knox.
  The author commenced his memoir by observing, that about two
years ago, he read to the Society some observations                     respecting an
entozoon, of a very singular nature, occurring                amongst the human
muscles, a species of minute, and indeed microscopic, vibrio. The
merit of the discovery was due to Messrs Hilton and Paget of
London. Dr Farre afterwards gave an account of its internal struc
ture.    Soon afterwards it was announced, that this peculiar ento
zoon had occurred in other dissecting rooms — in Bristol, for example,
and in Dublin. It was added, that the occurrence was rather
frequent, in Dublin particularly, and that its existence amongst the
human muscles seemed              traceable to previous debility and exhaus
tion of the person before death had occurred.             The author of the
present memoir       is,   however, of opinion, that neither of these points
have been made out clearly.
  The worm, the Cysticercus           Cellulosce    which forms the subject of
the present memoir,          is   oftener met with than the preceding one             ;

                                         186
still in Scotland        it is  rare.   It   occurs rarely in Vienna,     on the
authority of Bremser        ; but Rudolphi     says, that every session    a few
cases occur      in the dissecting-rooms of Berlin.           The points of its
anatomy, to which the author chiefly directed his attention, was,
\sf, The structure of the enclosing cyst or capsule, which he still
maintains to be an essential part of the worm, although not mechani
cally connected with it ; and offers it as his decided opinion, that
neither     in the cysticercus, nor in the vibrio, does the enveloping
cyst seem to be formed out of the surrounding cellular tissue.                2d,
The anatomy of the disk of hooks, whose sole use anatomists                 have
hitherto supposed to be to enable the parasite to attach itself to the
surrounding textures of the animal on which, and by which it lives :
— to    the so assigned use ho finds an insurmountable            objection  if it
really be, as most imagine, that the cyst or capsule is closed on all
sides ; and ho further has described certain rounded or oval bodies,
resembling globules, situated near the base of each hook, which he
conjectures may be young              cysticerci,  which view, should it prove
ultimately correct, would show that the disk of hooks is more par
ticularly connected with the generative system than with the digestive
organs.
    3.   Examination        of certain Objections to the Theory of Iso
           morphism.          By Henry Madden, Esq.
    The object of this paper was the refutation of certain arguments
brought forward against the doctrine of Isomorphism, more espe
cially by    those who allow       the existence of an approach to, although
they deny absolute identity of, form.
    The author      sets out   by showing that most of the arguments           are
 deduced from observations made              on crystallized   minerals ; and he
then     proceeds     to state    the many important       circumstances which
 tend to influence the form of these bodies, but which can be easily
avoided in those salts which admit of being formed artificially ;
 such are, the intense temperature to which they are subjected, the
 pressure of surrounding matter, the admixture of foreign bodies, &c.
each and      all of which he proves to exert a powerful influence over the
 forms of crystals.        From these facts, he concludes that the law of Iso
 morphism cannot be considered as invalidated by any slight differences
 found to exist in minerals, unless it could be proved that the crys
 tals  in question were formed under precisely similar circumstances.
The author next proceeds to give an account of the results of his
 own experiments (when competing for the Hope prize), in so far

                                        187
as   they show what        circumstances require particular          attention,    in
comparing even artificial crystals.        In this   part he proves, that the
sooner crystals are measured       after their deposition       the better ; that
the solution should he placed under precisely similar             circumstances ;
that   even the position        of the   crystals   in    the  vessel    in which
they are formed, and the length of time that they have remained in
contact with the mother-liquid, are circumstances of great import
ance,   since   even the      system of    crystallization     may    he changed
by the latter.     The author concludes by the consideration of two
objections, drawn from observations made on artificial salts.                    The
first of these is the well-known objection by Dr Clark of Aber
deen.     This he refutes on the ground that the case in question is
not a strict case of isomorphism, as the term is employed by Mit-
scherlich ; and he brings forward abundant proof in support of this
fact.    The last objection is that which refers to the isomorphism of
potass   and ammonia      ;  here,  however, he shows that the difficulty
falls to the ground,     if   the new and evidently more correct notion
regarding     the constitution     of ammoniacal salts        be substituted      for
the older opinion.

    The parallelogram which formed the subject of this communication
is the rectangle whoso sides are to each other in the ratio of
the diagonal of a square to its side, — a figure well known to archi
tects, sculptors, and painters, from its beauty, and frequently adopted
in the practical arts.
    The author showed that if the given rectangle be bisected by a
line parallel to its shortest side, each segment will be a figure similar
in all respects to the original rectangle ; and if either of these
halves be itself bisected in the same manner, their halves will be
rectangles similar to the original rectangle ; and so on ad infinitum.
The sides of the primary figure and its halves are continual propor
tionals, represented by the series

The author endeavours to trace an analogy between the properties
of this parallelogram and the logarithmic spiral.
    A class of figures may be obtained by trisection and by division
 into four, five, or any number of figures, all of them similar
to the primary figure, and capable of division ad infinitum in the
same manner.

   1.    On the Composition of a new Ink, which, by resisting
          chemical deletion, promises to diminish the chances of
           the successful             falsification       of bills, deeds, and other
           documents.              By Professor Traill.
   The author was led to the investigation of this subject by its con
nection with that branch of Medical Jurisprudence which treats of
the prevention and detection of forgery.
  It is well known that common writing-ink may be totally effaced
from paper by certain chemical agents, and that several others so
impair its colour, that the characters traced with                     it   become illegible.
To the first   class      of chemical agents belong chlorine, and substances
containing     it,   as   well as oxalic acid to the second diluted solutions,
                                                    :
or the vapours of the mineral acids, and of                           the    caustic      alkalis.
These agents were applied to written specimens of                           a   great number
of different inks, and the       of resistance to their effects was

                         of the durability of each.
considered as the criterion
  These views engaged the author in an extensive series of experi
ments on coloured metallic preparations, suspended in different
vehicles, the results of which were laid before the Society.                               In    one
series, the colouring matter was precipitated on paper previously
imbued with various chemical substances, capable of effecting the
decomposition of the solutions applied but no advantage was ;
derived from this method.   No useful results were obtained from
the use of any of the metallic sulphurets      or iodides, either
alone or mixed with common                  ink ;   nor from preparations of indigo
or other vegetable colours.                Among        the metallic preparations which
resisted chlorine was          a   fine blue substance obtained by precipitating
chloride    of antimony            by ferro-cyanide        of potassium but     :was      it
immediately        destroyed         by    ammonia.        The rich yellow substance
formed by adding nitrate of cobalt                       to ferro-cyanide       of potassium
resists alkalis well       ;   but   it   is   effaced    by acids.     An ink composed
of both these last-mentioned metallic salts was effaced   immersion,            by
first in chlorine, and then in an alkali.
    These failures to produce     durable ink from metallic combina
                                            a
tions induced the author to attempt the composition                              of   a   carbon
aceous liquid which should possess the qualities of good writing ink.

                                        190
    The   inks    used   by the ancients were carbonaceous,        and have
 admirably resisted the effects of time ; but the author found that
 the specimens of writing on the Hcrculaneum           and Egyptian papyri
  were effaced by washing      with  water  ; and on  forming inks after the
 descriptions of Vitruvius, Dioscorides, and Pliny, he found that they
 did not flow freely from the pen, and did not resist water, —quali
 ties essential to a good writing-ink in modem practice.
     The carbonaceous inks with resinous vehicles, rendered fluid by
 essential oils, though they resisted water and chemical agents, had the
 disadvantages of not flowing freely from the pen, and of spreading
 on the paper, so as to produce unseemly lines.           Solutions of caout
 chouc in coal-naphtha, and in a fragrant essential oil, lately imported
 from South America,         under   the name of aceite de sassafrwi (the
 natural produce of a supposed Lauras) were subject to the same
 objections.
    The author tried various animal and vegetable fluids as vehicles
 of the carbon, without obtaining        the desired result, until he found,
in  A SOLUTION     OP THE     GLUTEN   OP WHEAT    IN PTBOLIGNEOU8    ACID, a
 fluid capable of readily uniting with carbon into an ink, possessing
 the qualities of a good, durable, writing-ink.          To prepare this ink
he directs gluten of wheat to be separated from the starch as com
pletely as possible, by the usual process, and when recent to be dis
solved in pyroligneous        acid with the aid of heat.        This forms a
saponaceous fluid, which is to be tempered with water until the acid
has the usual strength of vinegar.            He grinds each ounce of this
fluid with from eight to ten grains of the best lamp-black, and one
and a half grain of indigo.        The following are the qualities of this
ink.
    1. It is formed of cheap materials.
    2. It  is easily made, the colouring       matter readily incorporating
with the vehicle.
    3. Its colour is   good.
    4. It flows freely from the pen
    5. It dries quickly.
    6. When dry it is not removable by friction
    7. It is not affected by soaking in water.
    8. Slips of paper written on by this ink have remained immersed
in solutions of the above-mentioned chemical agents, capable of
immediately effacing or impairing common ink, for seventy-two hours,
without change, unless the solutions be so concentrated as to injure
the texture of the paper.

                                               191
     The author offers this composition as a writing-ink to be used on
paper, for the drawing            out of bills, deeds, wills, or wherever it is
important to prevent the alteration of sums or signatures, as well as
for handing down to posterity public records, in a less perishable
material than common ink.    He concluded his paper by stating,
that should      it   be found    to present an obstacle to the commission of
crime — should        it,   even in   a   single instance, prevent the perpetration
of an offence so injurious to society as the falsification of                 a   public
or   a   private document, the author             will rejoice in the publication of
his discovery, and consider that his labour               has not been   in vain.
     2.   Abstract of first part of Memoir on the Mid- Lothian and
            East Lothian Coal Districts.   By David Milne, Esq.
  The author commenced his communication by stating, that he
should divide his memoir into two parts, the first being devoted to
a   mere narative of facts, the second to explanations of these facts.
     Indescribing the geological features of the district, he noticed
first the stratified or rudimentary rocks, and next the unstratified
rocks.
     The stratified          consist      of   sandstone, shales,   limestones, coal,
and clays    ;   which rocks          seemed    severally to abound or prevail, in
the order now stated.
  These stratified rocks overspread the district from Portobello to
Gladsmuir, in an east and west direction    and from the Firth of
                                                         ;
Forth to the Lammermoor Hills, in      north and south direction.
                                                     a
Within these limits there are two basins, — the basin of the Esks,
and the basin of the Tyne and which basins are divided by the
                                          ;
ridge or high ground that runs from Prestonpans (on the shore of
the Firth) by Tranent, Falside, Carberry, and the Roman Camp.
  The Esk basin contains between sixty and seventy coal-seams,
exceeding one foot in thickness. The Tyne basin contains not more
than ten or twelve, being those which appertain to the lower part
of the deposit. The vertical depth of the Esk basin in its trough, —
or, in other words, the thickness of the deposits composing
                                                                                    it,
                                                                                    is
between 1000 and 1050 fathoms; but this thickness diminishes
rapidly to the south, arising chiefly from the coal-seams and sand
stone strata thinning away in that direction    and which diminution
                                                           ;
is compensated in but      trifling degree, by the increased thickness
                                 a
of the limestone in the same direction.
     The Tyne basin comprehends only the deposits lying below the
Great Seam of coal, and the entire thickness of these,                 is   greatly less

                                       192
 than in the Esk basin, arising chiefly from the sandstones and coals
 thinning away toward the east.
    The strata on the west side of the Esk basin, dip to the east and
 south-east at a very steep angle, and are in some places absolutely
 vertical.     On the opposite or   east side of the Esk basin, they slope
 to the west at an angle varying from 20° to 40°.
    The strata on the west side of the Tyne basin dip to the        east, at
an angle varying from 15° to 20° ; and on the opposite or east side
 of the same basin, they dip to the west at an angle of only 5° or 6°.
    In   the intervening     ridge which runs    from Prestonpans to the
 Roman      Camp, the strata mantle over from the one basin into the
 other, and are there occasionally broken so as to show an anticlinal
line.
    The different kinds of coal       were  described;   and it was  stated,
 that each kind was characterized by differences in the fissures or
joints intersecting them.
    The principal slips in the district were next pointed out     ; and the
author referred to a table he had constructed, showing the direction of
each, and the amount of dislocation produced on the intersected
 strata.    Between eighty and ninety of these were also laid down on
 the map accompanying the memoir.
    In   describing   the  unstratified rocks of the district, the author
 mentioned, there were no hills or amorphous masses of trap within
the proper limits of the Lothian coal-field ; and that the trap showed
itself only in dykes, which run in straight lines intersecting the
 strata.    He pointed out three or four such dykes, varying from 60
to 120 feet in width, — all of which appeared gradually to thicken
towards the west, and all of which run in nearly an east and west
direction.
     3.  The following Memorandum           was communicated by Pro
           fessor Forbes.
    "  A  series  of delicate and tedious experiments on heat have con
 ducted me      to the following results, which will be fully discussed in
a paper    shortly to   be laid before the Society.
    " 1. An     entire confirmation  of my previous statement, that differ
 ent kinds of heat are differently susceptible of polarization    by trans
 mission through a given bundle of mica plates         ; heat from obscure
 sources    being less polarizable than that from luminous sources.         I
 considered my investigation incomplete until       I  had proved not only
 that my former experiments had led me to correct results, but also

                                        193
why the only other person who             I believe has attempted to obtain
them was led to the opposite conclusion, as stated by M. Melloni
in the Annales de Chimie for May 1837, namely, that all kinds of
heat are equally susceptible of polarization.            I   have at length dis
covered,    in the description of M. Melloni's method, the           cause of his
failure to detect this fact.
    " 2. I have    ascertained the laws and measures of the depolariza
tion of heat by the doubly refractive energy of mica plates, by three
series   of experiments     with heat from different         sources,  each   per
formed with mica of various thicknesses.
    "
      3.  I  have discovered a method of measuring the mean index of
refraction     of heat from      different   sources   with very considerable
numerical     exactness,  which it is behoved is now done for the first
time ; and the results confirm the opinion already entertained, that
dark heat is the least refrangible, whilst that portion of luminous
heat which is transmitted         by glass is the most refrangibla            The
principle    of the method includes a complete analysis of the hetero
geneous heat derived       from any source into any number of portions,
between assigned limits of refrangibility."

   The following Communications            were made   :
   1.  Notice regarding a New British            Species of Coregonus.
          By Dr Parnell. (See Plate.)
   It was stated by    Dr Parnell, that in Lochlomond     are found two
species of Coregonus, one      of which he believes to be an undescribed
species, and the other, which was hrst noticed by Lacepede under the
name    of  Coregonus    Clupcoide,    has been confounded    by British
naturalists with the Coregonus Laveretus, or Ulswater Gwyniard.
   From Lacepede's short and imperfect description of the Coregonus
Clupeoide of Lochlomond, and as two species are now found inhabit'

                                          195
ing the same locality, it is impossible to state with a certainty as to
which of the species he alludes ; therefore the name of Coregonus
Lacepedei was proposed for the one species, and that of Coregonus
microcephalia       for the other,   as  illustrative of the  species.
   The Coregonus Lacepedei occasionally grows to the length of six
teen inches, and is distinguished by the great length of head com
pared with that of the body ; the snout extending beyond the upper
lip ; the under jaw the shortest            ; the length   of the pectorals and
dorsal fin     ; the large scales, the number of rays in the anal fin ; the
peculiar shape of the caudal, and the position                of the dorsal. It
agrees   in figure with     Scdmo   Wortmanii of Bloch, but not in descrip
tion.
    The Coregonus microcephalus does not grow to the size of the
last species, and differs from it in the head and pectorals being con
siderably shorter, and the snout not projecting               beyond the upper
lip.    It   is at once removed        from the vendace and pollan          in the
under jaw being the shortest.               On comparing it with Gwyniard,
it is  a much deeper fish, the head and pectorals much shorter ; the
upper jaw furnished with distinct teeth             : anal fin with fewer rays    ;
besides    it grows to    a larger size than the    Gwyniard
    These     fish are   found in Lochlomond in great numbers,               where
they are named          Powans    or Freshwater       Herrings,   and   are  much
prized in that neighbourhood             as being wholesome,      well-flavoured,
and delicate food, particularly during the autumn months.                   In the
stomachs of those examined were found several species of entomos-
tracious animals, larva of insects, a few coleoptera, and a number
of small tough red worms.             They shed their spawn in the months
of October and November, after which they continue out of condi
tion till March.
    2.  Abstract of Part II. of Memoir descriptive and explana
           tory of the Mid Lothian and East Lothian Coal-fields.
   This part of the memoir was devoted exclusively to an attempt
to explain or account for the facts described in the first part of the
memoir.
   The geological epoch, when the strata composing the coal-measure
of this district were deposited, was first noticed.                It was stated
that    these coal-measures were deposited at a period immediately
following the deposition of the Old Red Sandstone formation ; and
that this older formation was to be seen both on the north and on
the south sides of the Lammermuir Hills, dipping under the coal

                                          196
measures,   and resting        on the upturned     greywacke strata of these
hills. The lowest member of the Old Red Sandstone group is a coarse
conglomerate, evidently          formed by the denudation        of  these    grey
wacke hills    ; and the uppermost members consist of soft argillaceous
sandstone, of a deep red colour.
    The coal-measures of this particular district extend also over the
whole of East Lothian, though towards the north and north-east
they are much broken and shattered by eruptions of trap.                  Beyond
the east and south-east crop of the Tyne Coal Basin, there are no
members of the coal-measures proper, except those which occupy
the lowest part of the series.           The limestone known in the Esk and
the Tyne Basins, as lying under the North Greens Coal, undulates
along or near the           surface,   throughout    all the country between
Haddington and the             sea,   towards   North    Berwick, as well as
Dunbar and Dunglass, except at             those places now occupied      by trap
hills.
    It appears   that along the east margin of the Tyne Basin             there is
an anticlinal lino,       from which the limestone just spoken of dips
gently to the east, so as to form in some measure             a third basin, but
one very flat and much broken.
    The author    proceeded      next to speculate on the probable mode in
which the strata of the coal-measures             had been severally formed.
It   was inferred     from various circumstances, that they must have
been all deposited at the bottom of an aqueous medium, which in
certain parts, or at certain periods, was calm and tranquil, and which,
in other parts, or at other periods, was agitated by currents.
    The   shales   and     clays, it was said, might      have been formed of
 sediment washed down from the Lammermuir                   Hills  ; but    it was
 thought    that    the siliceous sediment        necessary  for  the enormous
 deposits of sandstone must have come, not from the greywacke hills
 chiefly, but from primitive formations, and which were probably
 situated far off towards the west and north
     In regard to the origin         of the limestone strata   in the district, it
 was inferred, that they had been formed by a precipitate of carbon
 ate of lime, held in solution by the aqueous medium, which over
 spread the district.         Water,    it was said, would hold carbonate of
 lime in solution,      if  there was an excess of carbonic acid        ;  and on
 the application      of heat,    a part of the carbonic acid gas would be
 liberated, and a precipitate occasioned.          To account for the remark
 able fact, that the limestone underlying the North Greens coal
  thickened as it approached the Lammermuir Hills, it was suggested

                                      197
that the water may have been warmer near them, not only from its
being shallower there, and thus more capable of being acted on by
solar and atmospheric influence, —but also from the subterranean
heat being there more intensely         felt or more frequently evolved.
The same theory might account for the formation of limestone in
the upper part of the basin, though in proportion to the distance
between the subterranean heat and the water, the precipitates of
lime would become less abundant and less frequent ; a considera
tion which would explain why the five or six beds of limestone that
occur in the district, are all situated in the lower half of the basin.
    With regard to the origin of the          eoaZ-seams,  it was observed,
there could be no doubt of their having         been formed   from accumu
lations   of vegetable matter, which,       at different periods, had beon
drifted from    a distance.     The fact of these accumulations having
taken place at the bottom of the same sea or aqueous medium in
which the other strata of the basin were successively deposited,
seemed to be placed beyond dispute, by the discovery in the sub
stance of the coal itself, and about four inches below the top of a
seam of coal, —of quantities of the teeth, bones, and scales of fish.
These remains belong to the same species, the remains of which had
been found    in the shales of this coal-field by Lord Greenock, and
 in the Burdiehouse limestone by       Dr Hibbert.
    The vegetable matter which formed most, if not all, of the coal-
seams of the district, appeared to have been drifted from the west
or north-west, because in these directions the seams get gradually
thicker.
    As all the vegetables found in the coal-seams and adjacent shales
are terrestrial, it seemed probable that they had been torn off or
swept away from their native sites by periodical inundations : — that
they had been carried out into a great lake or estuary, where, after
floating about    for  a  considerable time, they subsided in tranquil
waters, but not     before parting with the clay and other earthy
matters attached to their roots, and not before the sediment carried
off by the inundation,     and mechanically suspended in the water, had
time    to subside.    It   was  inferred    from   this circumstance, that
 beneath every seam of coal there ought to be a bed of fire-clay, —
an inference which agrees with the fact.
    After these vegetable accumulations had taken place, and probably
 after all the other strata of the basin were deposited, the entire
 series of rocks had evidently been operated on by some powerful
 agent, so as to give to each      its peculiar crystalline   structure, and

                                      198
many of the other known peculiarities in their constitution.            That
some such agent must have operated appears to be proved, (1.) By
the formation of joints and fissures intersecting the strata; (2.) By
the conformity of direction in these joints and fissures;       (3.) By the
internal movement      of  the  particles or ingredients   of the vegetable
mass among each other, whereby different kinds of coal were
formed in the same seam ; and (4.) By the fissures and cavities in the
coal being generally filled with pearl-spar, which could only be
derived from an aqueous medium impregnating             the vegetable mass,
and holding carbonate of lime and magnesia in solution.               It was
inferred    from these and other circumstances, that the agent which
had operated      on the strata after their deposition, was subterranean
hoat.
    The rest of the paper was occupied with an explanation of the
convulsions which had occurred after the deposition of these strata,
and in consequence of which they had been thrown into the form
and position now presented by them.            It was mentioned that the
very steep dip to the eastward, which the strata on the west side
of the Esk       basin  presented, was occasioned      by the eruption    of
Arthur     Seat, Blackford Hills, and the other trap     masses  that occur
along almost the whole extent of the west side of that basin.
    It was next shown, that before the enormous quantity of vol
canic matter which burst forth emerged from beneath the strata of
the district, these strata must have suffered dislocations        or cracks,
which would account for the slips and dykes that intersect the dis
trict.    It was also shown, how these slips and dykes behoved to run
generally in a direction between N. and W., and cause the dislocated
strata to sink down on the north side of them, rather than on their
south sides.      An explanation also was offered of the invariable rule
which had been found to prevail in this district          as in others, that
if  a  slip haded or sloped from the verticle, the strata       were always
lowest on the upper side of the slip.         A   reason was also assigned
for the fact, that in this district, the strata are not deranged (or in
other words, " thrown down
                                 "
                                   on either one side or other) by dykes,
but only by slips.

     1.  Practical Researches on Respiration.            By Dr D. B. Reid.
    The object of the author was to lay before the Society the result
of an investigation into the state of the air usually respired in
public buildings in this country and on the continent, to show that
the amount of air usually allowed          for respiration is far below what
is necessary to sustain the system in a healthy tone, and to give an
 account of the various experiments and observations upon which
 this opinion was founded.
     He entered also into an examination of the method that ought
 to be adopted in introducing and regulating the supply in different
 apartments.       In pointing out some facts connected with the gene
  ral history     of respiration,   he endeavoured to show the powerful

                                        200
   influence exerted by a full supply of light, and the important           effect
   it  has upon the general health ; and concluded by referring to the
   minute    quantities  in which he had found          some   gases  to exert    a
   very deleterious influence     upon the animal economy, and a state
   ment of the result      of experiments      made    with absolute     carbonic
   acid, and various mixtures of this gas with air.
      2.  Observations on the       Fur Seal of Commerce.            By Robert
            Hamilton, Esq.
      The author states that the Fur Seal merits attention in a com
  mercial as well as a scientific point of view.          The South Sea Seal
  trade, though comparatively        of recent  origin, has been prosecuted
  to a much greater extent than the northern         ;  and especially in pur
  suit of two species     of seals, — the  Proboscis    Seal, or Sea Elephant,
  for its oil, and the Fur Seal, for its skin.
      After some preliminary remarks upon the nature of the coats or
 robes of seals, the author, in the absence of scientific information con
  cerning the fur seal, turns to the works of navigators and seal-hunters,
 and finds distinct allusion made to it in the writings of Cook, Clayton,
 and especially of    Mr -Weddell, who commanded several expeditions
 undertaken     chiefly for its capture.        This last-named gentleman,
 several years ago, presented two stuffed specimens of the animal to
 the Royal Museum of the Edinburgh University, and from these a
 detailed account is given of the external characters, and the measure
 ments, together with a coloured drawing by        Mr Stewart.       The animal
 is an Otary; the length      of the largest males is little short of 7 feet
 whilst that of the full-grown female is about 3£ feet.              The habits
 of the animal, so far as known, are then supplied, together with an
 explanation    of that singular peculiarity    common to the whole group,
 whereby,     with little or no     use of   their limbs,   these   amphibious
 quadrupeds can yet, on land, outstrip        a man pursuing       them at   full
speed.
     The author then turns to the identification of this species, .and
endeavours to show that it is not the Ursine Seal, or Sea-Bear, as
stated by some eminent French naturalists ; and, on the other hand,
that the Longicollis and Falklandica,          generally   enumerated as be
longing to different genera,      and whose descriptions        are universally
regarded as too vague and obscure to be           of any value, are yet one
and the same species, and that identical with the Fur Seal.                This
animal is at the same time distinct from the Otary discovered in

                                         201
the Falkland islands by MM. Lesson and Garnet, and described                         as
                       "
the 0. Molossina in the Zoologie de la Coquille."
  In     conclusion,      the author    maintains   that        there   are    probably
other seals which would yield fur similar in quality to that which
was long so much valued, and is now so greatly desiderated.

The following Communications                 were read     :   —
   1.    On the Wild Ox of Scotland.             By Dr Knox.
  In this memoir, the author endeavours to trace the antiquity of
the white   oxen of Cadzou and of Tankorville during the historic
period  of Britain, but thinks that materials are altogether wanting
for such an inquiry. No records exist in proof of these cattle being
aboriginal ; or, if introduced into the island by any of the three
great races of men found in        it,
                                    would be difficult to offer con
                                        it                                       a
jecture by which race they were introduced.        Had the cattle of
Britain been generally white in Caesar's time,      probable that that
                                                        it     is
great man would have noticed the fact.     The author thinks     evon           it
probable that these white cattle may have boen introduced by the
Romans themselves, since they were not found in Ireland.  Tacitus
mentions       that the    German cattle were without horns in his day.
By " Germans," Tacitus here            means   the Saxon race           ;   and yet the
descendants of these Saxons in Holland had so completely lost all
trace of the polled or hornless cattle of their ancestors, that they
refused credit to Camper when he asserted to his countrymen that
he had seen cattle without horns in Britain.
   In    the   second part     of the    memoir the            author   examines the

                                     202
question, Whether the white cattle of Britain constitute        a distinct
species   of the Bovine tribe, i.e. distinct from any known species or
variety of the domestic ox ? and he thinks that they do not ; but,
as the domestic ox of Britain, and of almost all countries, are now
a mixed breed, derived      from several species,  he is at a loss,  from
want of materials, to show to which of these       species the white ox
of Hamilton most approaches.           They seem to him to bear the
strongest resemblance to the Galloway breed.           From not having
been able to procure a cranium of the Tankerville white ox, he, of
course,   cannot say to what species it may belong.
    The cranium of the wild ox of Hamilton differs very much from
that of most domestic oxen, particularly in the breadth of the fore
head, shortness of the nasal bones, and configuration of the interior
of the nostrils.    Many of the bulls have horns, whilst others are
polled.
    The author, with reference to the relation these oxen bear to
fossil crania of the Bovine tribe, thinks that none of the fossil speci
mens which he has seen in museums, or which have been delineated
in M. Cuvier's work, could have belonged to an animal similar to
the existing species, and thinks that they may have differed even
genetically.
    The author   suggests,  in conclusion, that the type of   these  cattle
 can never be satisfactorily      made out so long as their   breeding is
 so much interfered   with by the destruction of all the calves which
 may differ in form or colour from the standard considered by the
 noble proprietors as essential to the purity of the breed.
     2.  On the Third Pair of Nerves.         By Sir C. Bell.
     This paper is the first of three communications, in which is shown
 the distinctions in the regular series of nerves arising from the spinal
 marrow, and the ten nerves which arise directly from the brain.
     The author remarks, that unless we comprehend the reason of the
 perfect symmetry of the spinal nerves, as contrasted with the irregu
 larity of the encephalic nerves, we must confess ignorance of much
 of the structure of the animal frame.
     After a general view of the nerves arising from the base of the
  brain, and assigning the reason of their apparent irregularity, he
  enters on the investigation of the third nerve.       He shows that it
  arises from the distinct columns of which the crus cerebri is com
  posed, by courses of parallel    filaments ; and that these   afterwards

                                         203
compose     a dense   structure     resembling ganglion.        From the anato
mical   facts   he deduces these conclusions          : — That the third nerve
being the motor of the eye, is unique in structure and function ;
that it arises anterior to the ports or nodus cerebri, in order to be
free of the intricate   texture of nerves which have reference to the
complex operations of the trunk and limbs;                  that  the   necessary
combination     of motion and sensation in the eye, uncontrolled                 by
remote relations, and free of the combined operations of the frame,
is the reason both of its peculiar origin and of the intimate combin
ation of a sensitive and motor root
    3. Inquiry whether Sea Water has its Maximum Density at
          some degrees above its freezing point, after the manner
          of fresh water.       By Dr Hope.
   Dr Hope stated that it has         been considered a matter of consider
able importance     in the reasonings of geologists and hydrographers
respecting some oceanic phenomena, whether sea water obeys at all
temperatures the general law of expansion by heat, and contraction
by cold, or, after the manner of fresh water, observes the anomalous
course of contracting by heat, and expanding by cold, during a short
range of temperature near its congealing point.
   In 1788, Sir Charles Blagden concluded, from               a solitary   experi
ment, that a solution of common salt, chloride of sodium, in water,
began to expand, when cooled to about 8° above its freezing                point ;
and thence it has been inferred, that all solutions of salts will exhibit
the same phenomenon; and the law has been laid down, that the
combination of a salt with water has no other effect upon its quality
of expanding by cold than to depress the point at which that quality
begin 8 to be sensible, just as much as it depresses the point of con
gelation, and that saline solutions begin to expand at 7$° above
their point of congelation.          Transferring these views      to sea water,
its maximum density was supposed to be about 36J°.                  Various    rea
sonings were founded upon that supposition.
   Dr Hope then adverted to the discordant                   experiments    of  Dr
Marcet in 1819, of M. Erman in 1828, and of M. Despretz in 1836
and 1837.
   The object of Dr         II. 's  inquiries was to ascertain whether          sea
water and stronger solutions of common salt are subject to the com
mon    law, or the anomalous aqueous             one.    He carried on the in
vestigation    in two   modes,     1st, By employing thermometric         glasses,

                                        204
  containing the saline fluid, and observing the descent of the fluid in
  the stem during cooling to the point of congelation,          and its subse
  quent ascent when again exposed to heat
    The result    was, that the fluids    descended in the tube from cold,
  and ascended     from heat uninterruptedly,     as mercury and alcohol   do;
  and did not, like water, present any appearance          of interruption in
  their course or retrocession.
    2d, But as doubt must always hang over experiments conducted
 in this manner, in consequence of the interference of the changes in
 the capacity of the thermometric instruments, arising from the alter
 ations of temperature, he resorted to the method described in his
 memoir read to this Society in 1804.          This consists in discovering
 the effects of heat and cold on the density of fluids, by ascertaining
by thermometers, placed near the top and bottom of a column of
the fluid, the direction of the currents induced in the fluids, fully
assured, that the rarer       will invariably ascend, and denser descend.
Proceeding     in  this manner, Dr H. found that, when a frigorific mix
ture was applied to the middle of        a column of sea water at the 40th
degree, the cooled water immediately          began to dascend to the bot
tom,    and continued      to do so steadily    till the thermometer at the
bottom     indicated    the   congealing temperature of the fluid; and
again, that when heat was thrown into the middle             of  a column of
sea water cooled to     its freezing point, the heated fluid immediately
began    to ascend,     and continued to do so uniformly and uninter
ruptedly.
    From this and the preceding series of experiments, Dr Hope
considered himself warranted to conclude, that the strange anomaly
which fresh water presents does not exist in sea water. — That at
all temperatures above its point of congelation, it is expanded by
heat and contracted by cold , and that its maximum            of density  does
not occur at 7£° above its point of congelation, as is the case with
pure water.
    Dr Hope       did not touch      the very difficult   and perhaps inde
terminable     question, viz., the temperature at which sea water and
solutions of salt have their maximum            of density  ;  reserving that
question, and the consideration of the effects         of various substances
soluble in water in rendering this fluid obedient to the general law
of expansion by heat and contraction by cold, for another memoir.

   1.   On the Origin and Compound Functions of the Facial
       Nerve or Fortio Dura of the Seventh Nerve. By Sir C. Bell.

                                       206
     In this   paper the author treats of the      Facialis nerve or portio
  dura of the seventh nerve.
     He commences with       a view  of the Respiratory System of Nerves.
  Vindicating the term, he proceeds to show that the Facialis belongs
  to this system, and that it possesses a double function and double
  origin.    That this composite condition of the nerve is not, however,
  like the double nerves of the spine (which have a root for motion
  and a root for sensation), but that its origins show     it to be connected
  with the column of voluntary motion and of the column of respira
  tion.    Ho then enters on the illustration of the various influences
  exerted through the filaments of this small nerve on the face.            Its
  double relation to the will and to the automatic action — the motions
  of the air passages in unison with the other respiratory actions —
  the combination with the same in speech ; and, finally, as they are
  the instruments of expression, of emotion or passion.            Concluding
  with   a comparison of the many functions      of the nerve with its com
  plex origins.

 then describes the instrument,       which,  in its simplest form, consists
 of  a glass-tube bent into the form of the letter      U   inverted, the one
 end open in the line of the arms downwards,          the other has its point
 turned up at right angles to this line.         A divided     scale is placed
 between the tubes, having its zero point as the centre.            When the
 instrument     is used, the upper curve and arms are to be filled with
 oil, or any other fluid lighter than water, as far as the zero on the
 scale ; the remaining parts of the tubes are to be filled with water.
 If  the instrument     is in this state placed in any current, with the
 end of the tube which is bent at right angles turned             towards the
 current, the oil   will rise in the one arm and descend     in the other, till
the velocity of the current is counterbalanced by the length of the
column of oil displaced, and this varying with the velocity, serves
as   its  measure.    The author then     goes on to describe     the form of
instrument     to be used for giving the rate of sailing of a ship, being
a modification of the same instrument, to answer the situation and
to correct for want of perpendicularity caused by the heeling of the

                                       207
vessel.      The communication with the      sea is made    hy tubes brought
from the bottom at midships           to the cabin, where the glass tubes
and scale are placed ; and the rate of sailing           may at all times   be
known by observing the length of the column of oil displaced.

    1.   Researches on Heat.       Third Series.       By Professor Forbes.
   This paper is divided into three sections, each containing a dis
tinct investigation.
   The First Section is on the Variable Polarizability of different
kinds of Heat.          This fact, namely, that when polarization takes
place by refraction through a bundle of parallel mica plates, some
kinds of heat      are less completely polarized than others at the same
incidence,     the author proposed to establish in the second series of
his    researches.      His investigations,   however,     having  been   con
sidered by some persons as open to objection,          and directly contrary
results having been obtained by M. Melloni in his repetition of these
experiments, the author was induced to investigate the subject anew,
and with every precaution.         He used rays of heat rendered parallel
by a rock-salt lens, previous to falling on the mica plates, which
were removed to a distance from the pile ; but still the differences
in the Parallel and Crossed positions of the mica bundles, when
heat of various qualities       was used, were as unequal        as formerly ;
and     having   varied the experiment      in different    ways, the author
concludes      by adhering to his former conclusion, and gives the
following table of the proportions of the heat penetrating the mica

     The apparently uniform polarizability of all kinds of heat, as
observed by M. Melloni, the author shows must necessarily arise from
the use of mica bundles, such as ho used, consisting of a great num
ber of distinct plates of mica superimposed.                        Such a thickness of
mica modifies heat from dark sources                   in such     a way as to give the
portion which it transmits the same character as to polarizability
as luminous heat.           The plates used by the author, and split by the
action of a hot fire, as explained in a former paper, contain so many
surfaces within         a very small         thickness,     that the polarized heat is
comparatively        unaltered     in its character.           The author shows that
the piles used by him transmit heat from a lamp sifted by glass,
and from brass at 700°              in nearly equal proportions,                  whilst mica
-016     inch thick transmits             five times      less  of the latter than the
former.
     The Second Section relates to the Depolarization of Heat.                             Pur
suing the methods given in the first series, the author ascertained
the proportion         of   heat depolarized          by five different            thicknesses
of mica.        From the numerical results thus obtained, he deduces
the value of the expression in Fresnel's formula of depolarization,
         retardation       gj^gj.

       length of wave'
other becomes known.              If     the numerator        (the) difference of paths
described within the depolarizing mica plate by the ordinary and
extraordinary        ray) be assumed           to be      the same        as    in light, the
length of a wave would come out 3 times as long as                              for red light,
and 4| times as long as a violet wave.                     Since, however, this result
seems not easily reconcilable              with  the   slight difference of the           mean
refractive index for heat and light (which is afterwards obtained),
the author rather inclines to the supposition, that the energy of

                                          209
 double refraction is smaller for heat than for light, or that a greater
 thickness of the medium is required to produce a given retardation.
 Almost exactly similar numerical results were obtained                       for heat
 from an argand lamp, from incandescent platinum, and from brass
 at 700°.
    The Third and longest Section of the paper, relates to the Index
 of Refraction for Heat of different kinds compared to Light.                       The
 method of observation adopted by the author, resembles in principal
 Dr Wollaston's method of determining Indices of Refraction for
 Light by the Critical Angle of Total Reflection.                       (Phil. Trans.
 1802.)    The practical part consists in determining the critical angle
 of transition from partial to total reflection within a rock-salt prism,
 having   two angles of 40° and one of 100°.                The sentient surface
of the thermal pile is so placed with regard to the prism, that it
continually receives rays coming from the source of heat after under
going two refractions       and one reflection, whatever be the angle of
incidence.     This is accomplished            by mounting the whole on a
jointed rhomboidal frame, the surface at which total reflection takes
place being maintained by a mechanical contrivance constantly per
pendicular     to  the    diagonal     of  the rhomboid,        the incident       and
reflected rays being always parallel           to its side, to which the source
of heat and thermal pile            are fixed.    In this    way (a number of
precautions     being taken, and modes of reduction adopted which
cannot here be explained) the following indices                of refraction      were
approximately      determined, for the mean quality of the                  heat most
abundantly contained in the rays obtained from various                               —

   The following general conclusions were deduced from the experi
ments of this section :—(1.) That the mean quality, or that of the

                                          210
 more abundant proportion of the heat from different sources, varies
within narrow limits of refrangibility. (2.) That these limits are
very narrow indeed where the direct heat of any source is employed.
(3.) That all interposed media (including those impermeable to
light),  so  far   as tried, raise the     index of refraction.      (4.) That all
the refrangibilities      are inferior to that of the mean luminous rays.
(5.) That the limits of Dispersion are open to farther inquiry, but
the dispersion in the case of the sources of low temperature appears
to be smaller than in that from luminous sources.
    2.  Kemarks on the Illustrations presented by the Surface of
          the Moon, respecting certain Geological Phenomena.
          In   a Letter to Sir       J. Eobison,      K.H.,  &c. from Professor
          Nichol, University of Glasgow.
   Professor      Nichol     conceives that, as      the upheaving      cause is   a
general or cosmical phenomenon, no true or complete theory of                     it
can be deduced from a review of its merely terrestrial actions ; and
in the notice read to the Society, he called the attention of geolo
gists to a few general but important inferences, from the peculiar
form of the elevations in the moon.
    The author introduced          his observations, by adverting       to the fol
lowing    facte,   as now ascertained        and generally known concerning
these elevations.
    1. There are ranges of mountains in the moon, but they are com
paratively    few.      Some    of   them,    especially   the  Apennines,    with
their attached extensive highlands, bear            a close resemblance to many
terrestrial ranges.
    2.  The chief form of elevation is the circular. The moon's sur
face is absolutely      studded with crater-forms, — objects recently exa
mined with much care, and represented                 in an admirable map, by
Beer and Madler of Berlin.               Their diameters vary from fifty or
sixty miles to the minimum             visibile, and they greatly increase in
number as their magnitude diminishes.                   They are all marked by
this singular feature — their interior is deeper than the general lunar
surface, as    if   the elevation had been occasioned by a mass of the
moon being blown out from a single point of disturbance.                   It is to
be noticed, likewise,       that the external effect       of this disturbance in
 no case extends very far.          In  some    instances the crater-ridge rises
 at once out    of the flat body of the moon, without appearing to affect
it   almost at all    ; but even where this surface has been raised and

                                           211
disturbed, as in the case of the crater Copernicus, the sphere of the
action seems exceedingly            confined, when compared with the trans
verse    extent    through     which     a disturbance          is   felt on the earth.
There is nothing on the earth to which these formations                             can be
likened, except " craters of elevation."                 The Cantal and the Mon
tagues d'Oisans, however, appear to be the ruin or debris of very
similar objects.
  3. For the most part, the disposition of these craters is irregular
and capricious ; but, in a number of instances, sufficiently consider
able to indicate the operation of law, we find rows of small craters,
close to each other, arranged almost           in   a   straight line.         This arrange
ment      is perhaps    a    clue   to   two     phenomena.                First, Were the
craters   little closer, a longitudinal portion of the moon's surface
          a
would      blown out, and a furrow would result, exactly like those
          be
curious furrows or ditches, which have often puzzled moon-explorers.
Secrnidly, Had the seat of the disturbance been somewhat deeper,
or the disturbing force somewhat weaker,                 a mere      rectilinear elevation
would have ensued, — a serrated chain               of   mountains.
   Generalizing on these phenomena, Professor Nichol suggests that
the following conclusions may be safely hazarded.
   I. The forms of the moon give decided countenance to the theory
of elevation craters, developed by Von Buch and De Beaumont, as
at least one modus operandi of the upheaving cause. It even appears
to be the leading or fundamental one.
   II.    The doctrine        of the central heat derives no support from
these phenomena.            The irregular distribution of the craters is not
favourable        to the idea of any central or general action; and the
limited sphere of the disturbance connected -with them, demonstrates
that their source is superficial.  They rather appear as the clearing
oid of local deflagrating forces, whose seat is between the two outer
most shells of the moon's body.
   III. The hypothesis of secular refrigeration      according to theis,
author, discredited by the survey of lunar phenomena.        This hy
pothesis was formed upon the idea, that elevations are generally
linear, and along great circles of the sphere whereas in the moon,
                                                            ;
linear elevations are the exception.
   TV. The moon enables us to eliminate                 a   number of non-essential
circumstances, from the ultimate             problem        of the upheaving         cause.
For instance, the theory lately promulgated by Sir John Herschel
relative to the dependence of convulsion                  and elevation         upon abra
sion and stratification, according to the author,                    will not stand good,

                                      212
 Considering    that the temperature of the earth increases with its
 depth, in so far as we have yet descended, it is undoubted that
 abrasion and stratification   will cause changes  of temperature among
 the inferior rocks, and therefore expansions,      fractures, and exten
 sive though slow movements       ; and to this extent the theory indi
 cates  a vera causa, the origin,     probably, of certain changes   upon
the earth ; but     it is not the ultimate and complete theory of the
elevating cause.     The moon contains no abrading or stratifying agents,
nor is it probable that any substance akin to water has yet been
developed there.
    Professor Nichol means to examine with great care, and sketch
upon a large scale, some of the more characteristic        individual for
mations in the moon, with a view to their geological relations.         In
so far as general selenography is concerned, the labours of Beer
and Madler leave nothing to be desired.

 The following Communications            were read    : —
     1.  On the Fourth and Sixth Nerves of the Brain, being the
        concluding paper on the distinction observed in the Nerves
        of the Encephalon and Spinal Marrow.              By Sir   C. BelL
    As no fewer than six of the nine nerves which arise from the
 brain are connected with the organ of vision, he finds it necessary
to announce, not only the distinct sensibilities possessed by the organ
 of vision, but the motions to which it is subjected. Having shown
 the connection      of the voluntary motions of the eye-ball with the
 sensation on the retina, and the motions involuntary and for the
protection of an organ so delicate and so exposed, he proceeds to
show the necessity of combinations          among the muscles of the eye.
As    there are no direct communications between the muscles, neces
sarily united in action, he shows the necessity of distinct           nerves,
and also the necessity of their relations         being established at their
roots, and hence deduces the reason of the fourth and sixth nerves
deviating from the others in their place and mode of origin.
    The paper concludes with a recapitulation, accounting for the
fact that no one nerve of the head is like another, and why they
are   all different from the spinal nerves.
    First, As to the irregularity of the Nerves of the Senses, they
all tend inwards to that column which has received the nerves of
sense,    and must take a course round           the column which extends

                                          214
from        tho    spinal marrow to the brain,     and which is given to the
voluntary motions. Hence the form of the tractus opticus — the
peculiar roots of the olfactory nerve, and course of the roots of the
auditory nerve.
  Second,          The   third, fourth, part of the fifth, the sixth, in
                         second,
addition to the nerves of the eyelids, crowding into the orbit ; each
for a particular purpose, or with distinct endowment, causes much
of the apparent irregularity in the nerves of the base of the brain.
   Tfiird, The fifth nerve being like a spinal or double nerve, shoot
ing up into the base of the brain, and in the centre of nerves of a
peculiar function, gives additional intricacy.
  Fourth, The Nerves of .Respiration, standing distinct in origin and
function from all the others, and yet necessarily bestowing influence
on some of these, complete the apparent irregularity of the nerves
of the base of the brain.
  In       short the double origin and double       function of the nerves of
the spine, is the reason of their uniformity and simplicity, as they
are    all alike.        The nerves of the brain differ from     each other, and
from the nerves of the spine, inasmuch             as each has its peculiar    ori
gin and distinct function          ; they, therefore, vary   in course and distri
bution, and hence the apparent intricacy.
      2.    On the Superficial Deposits of Gravel, Clay, Sand, &c.
            which cover the Eock Formations of the Lothians, and
            south coast of Fife.       By David Milne, Esq.
  The author enumerated seven different deposits, overlying                    the
rocks of the district, and subjacent to the existing soil, which sup
ports vegetation.           These he described in the following order, begin
ning with the lowest.
   (1.) Sand and fine gravel, which in some places form beds twelve
feet thick.
                    —
   (2.) Boulder-clay being a stiff black or dark brown clay, char
acterised by enormous boulders imbedded in        and which
                                                         it,   occa       is
sionally forty feet thick.
                             — of light brown colour, full of gravel
  (3.) Gravel or stoney clay
                                           a
and angular fragments of rock, not exceeding thirty feet in thick
ness.
  (4.) Beds of fine clay, out of which the greater part of the bricks
and tiles manufactured in the district are made.   At Portobello this
clay       is   100 feet thick.

                                            215
        (5.) Banks of sand — pretty free from gravel, and containing occa
    sionally fragments of shale and coal, sometimes thirty-five feet
   thick, and existing at a level 200 feet above the sea,
        (6.) Shelly and sandy deposit, intervening between the shores of
   the    Firth of Forth and an ancient sea-cliff that runs nearly parallel
   to   the shore, but not rising higher than forty feet above high-water
   mark.
                                                         —
       (7.) Upper covering of gravel and boulders nowhere exceeding
   ten feet in thickness, and rising to a height of 900 feet above the
  sea.
       (8.) Existing soil.
      The particular characters of        each of these deposits were fully de
  scribed, and the organic remains found in each taken notice of ; the
  places where they are visible were mentioned, as also the highest
  level above the sea where the author had observed them.                  These
 matters of mere fact occupied the first portion of the paper.
      In the last part of the paper were stated the inferences            of the
 author       regarding     the  condition   of things  on the   surface of the
 globe      (in this particular district) when the several deposits above
  enumerated took place.
      (1.) The beds of sand and fine gravel indicate the             prevalence
 over the district of a deep sea, by the waters of which              the shales
 and sandstones and limestones of the coal-measures had               been worn
 down to a nearly uniform surface. Reference was made                 to a paper
 on      the coal-field of the Lothians, read at a previous meeting,
 where it was stated, that the strata cut across by the Sheriff-hall
 slip had sunk down ninety fathoms on the north side, in conse
 quence of which there had been a precipice of more than 500 feet
 on the south side, all which had been worn down and washed away.
As the whole coal-field was riddled with similar slips, it was evi
dent that abundance of materials would in this way be provided for
 the formation of banks of sand and gTavel.
     (2 ) The next period was characterized by violent and extensive
movement in the waters which covered the district.                 The boulder-
clay had,        with   its imbedded    boulders, been evidently brought from
the       west.      These boulders      were most numerous     to  the   east of
Arthur         Seat,   where    they  had been protected     from   the rush of
waters. The ruts and scratches on the boulders, and in the subjacent
rocks, were, both in Mid-Lothian and in Fife, about W. by S. in
direction by compass ; and, moreover, many of the boulders im
bedded in the clay belonged to rocks which do not occur nearer than

                                              216
Callendar.     A   deep     excavation        or scooping out in the rocks              was
noticed as occurring        between Niddry and Stoneybank,                 which    exca
vation is filled with large boulders.               The waters which transported
this enormous mass of debris must have been at least 600 feet above
the level of the present        sea.
   (3.) The stoney or gravel-clay, lying immediately over the
boulder-clay, indicated less violence and less extent of agitation and
movement in the waters.
   (4.) The deposits of clay prove that general tranquillity or calm
ness succeeded  the above periods.    From the discovery of terres
trial remains,     both      animal       and vegetable, in this deposit, it             is
obvious    that land had not been far distant ; and, accordingly, the
nature of the shells found in              it,   partakes somewhat of an estuary
character.
  (5.) The banks of sand which lie over the clay, show that the
supply of albuminous sediment which, during the former period, was
poured into the ancient sea, at or near this district, had altogether
ceased.    The fact of these sand-banks running nearly east and west
in all parts of the district, coupled with the discovery in them of
stones which must have come from the west, prove the general
direction of the current to have been from the west.      The sea at
this period must have been still at least 300 feet above the present
level of it.
   (6.) The next epoch          characterized by      very remarkable
                                 is                                a
change of the relative levels of sea and land.    The old bank which
runs nearly parallel with  the shores of  the Firth of Forth, has been
formed sometimes out of the fine brick-clay,                      and sometimes out of
the sand last described.         The      base of   this bank on the       east shore    of
                          about thirty feet above high-water mark                  whilst
                    it is
Haddingtonshire                                                                ;
towards the west            gradually      increases    to forty feet,    which    is   its
height    in Linlithgowshire.             A   bed of shells and         sand   generally
intervenes between said old bank and the present shore.
   (7.) The next period      characterized by
                               is              still more remarkable
                                                              a
change in the relative levels of sea and land.    The upper covering
of gravel and boulders has been spread over and above all the deposits
previously described, and   reaches even to the height of 900 feet
                                it
above the sea. This   would indicate  sinking of the land or eleva
                                                    a
tion of the waters, to that extent, and                 a   subsequent reversal of the
operation, whereby at length the land again emerged from the waters,
and attained the elevation which     now possesses.
                                              it     These boulders
are not very much rounded            in   shape,    and do not seem to have been

                                               217
transported        from very distant       parts.       They    are   frequently angular
in   shape.

     4.   On the Real Nature of Symbolical                      Algebra.      By D. F.
            Gregory, B.A.
     The object of this paper is to determine in what consists the dif
ference between general Symbolical Algebra and the sciences                            sub
ordinate to    particularly Arithmetical Algebra.
                   it,                              The view which
the author takes             is,
                    that Symbolical Algebra takes cognizance only of
the laws by which the  symbols are combined, without considering the
nature of the operations represented.                   The greater part of the paper
is   occupied in applying this definition, by showing what are the laws
to which are subject the various symbols of operations we are in the
habit of using           ;   and one or two examples are given of the advan
tages derivable from this way of considering the subject — particu
larly with respect to the connection between the arithmetical and
geometrical meanings of                         -
                                     The chief application of the
                                     +   and        .
theory may be said to be the elucidation of the causes of analogies
between operations by no means similar in their nature.
     2.   On   a   New Method in the Conic Sections.                        By   J.   Scott
          Russell, Esq.
     In this   paper the author institutes an examination of the various
methods of conceiving and constructing the conic sections, the differ
ent standards of comparison to which they have been referred, and
the means          by which their properties             have     been developed       and
expressed in the ancient and modern schools of mathematics.        He
finds that the constitutionof the curves in piano by means of their
remarkable properties, and the demonstration of their other properties
from the constitution so obtained, have been noticed by Eutocius
in the 6th century, and by him referred to Apollonius, although
the formal adoption of the plane method                    is   generally referred to     a
recent date.
     The author       with modern writers in considering the plane
                         agrees
method in the conic sections as more philosophical,  as well as more
useful, than the solid method; but he differs from them in the
methods of constituting these curves, without reference to what he

                                   218
considers their proper origin and standards of reference.     Apollonius
employed the straight line and circle to constitute his cone ; or, in
other words, he derived the conic sections from the straight line and
the circle, using the cone as the mechanism,         of derivation.    Mr
Russell has succeeded in deriving the conic sections from the straight
line and circle directly, without the intervention of the     cone.    He
thus removes    the conic   sections altogether from the geometry of
solids into the geometry of planes, according to the modern method,
without separating them from the family of the circle to which they
properly belong.
   The definition from which he sets out is this : If between a given
circle and its tangent straight line there be traced a curve whose
distance from the circle shall bear a constant proportion to its distance
from the straight line, that curve is a conic section, and according
as the given ratio is one of equality,   deficiency, or excess, the cone
becomes   a parabola, ellipse, or hyperbola.
   The author shows with how much facility the other properties of
the curve follow from this constitution : he gives examples of some
of these, shows a new and remarkable property of the tangents of
the conic sections, and proves that they may be readily identified
with the sections of the cone from the constructive       property alone,
without the intervention of any derived property.

     The following Communication was read                    :
  Discussion of one Year's Observations of Thermometers                        sunk
            to different Depths       in different localities in the neigh
            bourhood of Edinburgh.              By Professor Forbes.
     These observations were made, at Professor Forbes's suggestion,
 at the expense of the British Association.               They are still continued,
 and the present notice contains only a first approximation                   to the
 solution    of the problems which they are intended to give.
     The chief aim of the experiments is to ascertain the progress of
 Solar Heat in the Crust of the Globe, and has no immediate refer
 ence to the question of central heat         ;  the depth to which the expe
 riments extend being        inadequate   to afford decisive results on that
 head.
    The experiments differ in their object from any hitherto made,
 from having an especial regard to the structure of the soil and the
 conducting power for heat       of different geological formations.          With
 (bis view three series of thermometers were constructed by Mr
 Adie, under     Mr  Forbes's directions, each nearly of the same length
and range, and these were sunk in holes prepared for them to pre
cisely similar depths, (1.) in the Trap Tufa of the Calton Hill, with
in the Observatory grounds; (2.) in the homogeneous bed of Sand
at the Experimental Garden         ; and (3.) in the compact Coal Forma
tion Sandstone of       Craigleith Quarry, all in the immediate neigh
bourhood of Edinburgh, and within a radius of about a mile.                   With
a  view to render     these observations      more immediately        comparable
with those made at Paris and Brussels, the extreme depth was the
same, or     the lowest    thermometer      had its bulb at the distance          of
24 French feet      (= 25.6 English) below the surface, and the others
were placed at each station at depths of             1 2, 6, and 3  French feet.*
      At  the Observatory   a thermo-electric     pair of iron and copper wires

                                                     224
   The tube which connected the bulb with the reading part above
ground was made capillary, so as to contain as little liquid (alcohol)
as possible. Notwithstanding, all the observations hare been ri
gorously corrected for the inequality of temperature of their stems,
and likewise for the expansion of the liquid above ground.       The
observations were commenced in February                                 1887, and have been
made once every                 week       since.       After being corrected they were
projected      in the form of Curvesand the general consistency of
                                                           :
these with one another, and the peculiarities proper to each station,
are such as to give considerable                           confidence     even     in the first ap
proximation, which extends from February 1837 to February 1838.
   I. The general form of the curves at all the stations correspond
ing to different depths agrees perfectly with what has hitherto been
observed under similar circumstances.     As we descend, the curve
becomes more even, and flatter, the range rapidly diminishing, and
the epochs       of minimum,                mean,       and maximum           temperature               occur
later.
   II.    The    mean temperature                of the soil appears to increase as we
descend (this has been                     observed at Brussels and elsewhere).     At
the Experimental Garden the mean annual temperature                                          is,   at   3   feet
(French), 45°.54 Fahr. at   feet, 46°.70
                                       ;    at 12 feet, 46°.90
                                                 6                at
                                                                   ;                                      ;
24 feet, 47°.28. The Craigleith observations are ambiguous   in this
respect.
   III.    The annual ranges at the three stations and at the different
depths, are the following                  :
                                  3    Feet.                                      6    Feet.

    Now     it   is   known       by
                                 theory that the range ought to diminish in
 geometrical          progression as the depths increase arithmetically and                             ;
 accordingly these results may be very closely represented by loga
 rithmic curves, having different Moduli at each station, depending
 was sunk aloug with the deepest thermometer,     with a view to test the ap
 plicability of M. Peltier's apparatus to this object. Several observations
 closely agreeing with the thermometer have thus been made.

                                           22.5
   on the nature of the soil.          If     denote the range in         Centigrade
   degrees at a depth p, and         A  and   B two    constants, we have
                                   Lo£- AP =      A + B^
                                 /specific Iieat
   And     B depends    upon   »/ conductivity of the soil.          Now this con
   stant   B  is found to have the following negative values           :  *
          Observatory   — 0.0547  ; Garden   —   0.0440 ; Craigleith —   0.0317.
   Consequently      the conducting       power of the strata is in the order
, just written, the first being the lowest, the last the greatest (sup
   posing the difference of specific heat immaterial).                By extending
   the Logarithmic        curve,    the depth      at which the range has any
   amount maybe found.t            Thus the range will       be reduced to      Tic of
   a Centigrade      degree, or may be reckoned insensible, at the follow
  ing depths     :—
    Observatory,    58 feet ; Experimental Garden,      72 feet; Craigleith,   97 feet.
       Now it is remarkable that the above variations in the value of B
  exceed those contained in M. Quetelet's table, which includes all
   the observations made in different           parts of Europe     ; shewing that
   the increase     of the value of B with the Latitude, which was thought
   to have been observed (Quetelet, Mtmoiresur les Variations Diurne
  et Annuelle de la Temperature Terrestre, p. 61), was quite acciden
  tal   ; and that the value of     B  must depend solely on the constitution
  of the soil in which the experiments are conducted.
       IV. The epochs of the winter minimum of 1837 are ill deter
  mined for the upper thermometers,             owing to the great irregularity
  of the winter curve, and also because the observations were com
  menced too late to obtain them correctly.                The epochs of maxi
  mum temperature         give, however, a complete confirmation of theory,
  and     of the preceding deductions.          We find that, with a single ex
  ception (the shortest thermometer at Craigleith), and that excep
  tion is doubtful, all the thermometers at Craigleith attained their
  maximum first, then those at the Experimental Garden, and lastly,
  at the Observatory, as the following table shews : —
     •
        In order   to render the results directly comparable with those in M.
  Quetelet's   excellent  paper in the Brussel's Transactions, the French foot
  and Centigrade     degree are employed as unities.
     t The values    of A are 1.164, 1.176, 1.076 in the same order as before.

We   also find, as theory assigns, the retardation                                      of the maximum
increases arithmetically with the                                depth.         So that,           if    we project
these observations and cause an interpolating straight line to pass
through the points for                      each station, we find that the progress                            of heat
downwards            is,

1.  On the Law which connects              the   Elastic Force of Vapour
       with its Temperature.           By John Scott Russell, Esq.
   The object of the paper was to examine into the present state
of our knowledge of this subject, for the purpose of ascertaining its
defects, and indicating the manner in which               they were to be re
medied.
   Although       it appears to any one who examines             only  a   single
authority on the constitution of vapour, that its laws are sufficient
ly definite, yet     on comparing    together    all the authorities we pos
sess on this subject,       or even the best of them, we find such dis
crepancies      both in the general expressions        of the law, and in the
experiments       themselves     upon which    they rest, as are highly dis
creditable    to mechanical science, and far exceed the limits           of error
usually admitted        in similar departments      of experimental science.
Between 32° and 212°, the difference between Dr Dalton's expe
riments and Dr Ure's amounts to more than three-tenths of an inch
of mercury. Between the experiments of the Institute of France
and of the Franklin Institute, — the latest and most extensive series
of experiments, — there is a difference at the eleventh atmosphere

                                        228
of more than     6° in temperature,      and about 20 inches       of mercury in
 the pressure of the vapour.
    The author entered into a comparison of the empirical formula;
 which have been successively employed to express in mathemati
cal terms the simultaneous          progressions     of temperature and elas
tic force.     These are of two classes : the first comprehends the
formula) of Prony, Laplace, Biot, and Ivory, in which the elasticity
is the sum of the terms of an infinite series, of which five terms at
least now require to be taken; and it was shewn that, even with
an   operation    so  tedious   and laborious,      the results    of calculation
                                                    ....
differ from those     of experiment still more widely even than thoso
from each     other.    The formulae are as follows : —
     (i.)  vt  =      +       +         &c.                              prouy.

    The other class of formulae are those of Dr Young and his fol
lowers.     He was the first to give a manageable expression of a
simple form, in which        the expression       for the elastic force of     the
vapour    is merely a multiple         of the temperature,        increased by a
constant quantity,      and placed under         the index 7.      This simpler
expression, although absolutely empirical,           having    been selected by
Dr Young,      as he   candidly avows, from above         a dozen others, mere
ly because it happened to approximate             to the best experiments       he
at that time possessed, yet has been almost invariably followed ever
since.    But while the form of the expression             has  been preserved,
it has been found necessary to alter the value             of its terms at   each
step of experimental       research, in such a manner that this branch of
knowledge      now appears to have become               degraded     to the very
lowest degree      of empiricism.       Dr Young's expression having been
found too high for the subsequent experiments of Southern, the
index was reduced from 7. to 5.13.               Dr Ure's experiments next
made their appearance, and forthwith the index               7  being found    too
great, and 5.13 too small, the number 6. was adopted as best re
presenting them.        The subject being next examined by M. Coriolis,
who, reviewing the works of all his predecessors, found none of
them sufficiently consistent, he satisfied himself with taking an
average of the whole, and obtaining as an index the mean number

                                          229
5.355.        But Mr Tredgold, arguing that a fractional number was
not likely to represent a law of nature ! restored the index 6.               His
decision has been overturned             by the Commission      of the Academy
of Sciences, who have adopted the number 6, as best representing
their higher experiments ; and last of all, this decision is reversed
by the Committee of the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia, who
alter other terms of the formula, but reinstate the index 6.
    These formulae are : —

    The author next proceeded to examine the theoretical views of
 Dr Dalton. From long calculations, and laborious discussions of
the experiments and formulae, he has been                led to the conclusion
that, with certain       modifications,      these views represent      the actual
 state of our knowledge          of this subject better than any of these em
pirical formulae.        Dr Dalton finds, that, if the scale of temperature
 which       he considers   as the true scale be reckoned from a zero at
 1 75°   lower than the present scale of Fahrenheit, the progressions
of the temperatures being as the square root of the expansions of
the mercury, then the progression of the elasticities will be in geo
metrical ratio to those equal or true intervals of temperature.                By
modifying this hypothesis, so as to reduce it to the following, that
 the intervals of the common scale are in a geometrical ratio to the
intervals      of true temperature, reckoned from a point 175° below
the present zero, Mr Russell finds that he obtains formulae that
 perfectly represent the best series of experiments, — so closely in
 deed, that the greatest difference between theory and experiment
 does not exceed j§5 of an inch of mercury from 0° to 212°, and
 as far as 25 atmospheres does not average half a degree.                      He
also adduces grtmnd for supposing that the theory                  of temperature

                                           230
    on which this rests is the only tenable one.               The first equation     is
    of this form    :
                                                 Log.F

    whence the experiments        of Dr Dalton are accurately represented
    by the expression
                                                       Log, f-

      But it is remarkable that, if one series of experiments below
   212° be taken, and any other above 212°, the expression which ac
   curately represents      the one will widely deviate             from  the other.
   So that, though a formula of the same nature represent                  the expe
   riments of the French Academy and of the Franklin Institute very
  accurately,    it requires   different constats.        If  we average    Dr Dal-
  ton's and     Dr Ure's below 212°, and those of the Academy                      and
   Institute above that point,         e find they coincide more nearly with
  the following formula than with each other :
                                ' + 121°
                                           =   1.11401LuK-*
                                  333°
      From the whole investigation, the author arrives at the follow
  ing conclusions : — (1.) That the discrepancies between the most
 recent and extensive        experiments      we possess are so great,          as to
 leave this branch of experimental            science in a disgraceful       state  of
 uncertainty,      and that   it is desirable that those who are engaged
 in experiments          on heat, would revise this useful and interest
 ing branch       of inquiry   ;  and it is suggested           that, for this   pur
 pose, the same apparatus         and   methods    of experiment which are        em
 ployed in the experiments          below atmospheric        pressure, should also
 be those which are employed            at high temperatures above atmosphe
 ric pressure.        (2.) That the most accurate experiments we are in
 possession of at pressures below 212° are Dr Dalton's recent ones,
 which accurately coincide with the hypothesis                 that the intervals of
the common scale are to those             of true temperature, in       a geometri
cal register, reckoned from the zero point                of the mercurial ther
mometer 175°          below the zero of Fahrenheit, and of which the com
mon ratio is 1.1320, the corresponding elastic forces forming the
logarithmic progression to the true temperatures, whose index is
2.602.        That the mean of the experiments of Dr Dalton, Dr Ure,
the French Academy, and the Franklin Institute, give 1.11401 as
the ratio of progression of the temperatures, 2.
                                                                   oeing the index

of the progression           of elastic force, and          — 121°       the zero    of same
temperature.          (3.) That Dr Dalton's theory of temperature does,
with very slight modifications, represent accurately our knowledge
of the law which connects the temperature with the elastic force of
vapour.      (4.) Expressions may             be derived       from this theory        of the
same form as the empirical              formulae at present in use              ; and these
are :

2.  Abstract of a Paper on Results of Observations made with
           Whewell's New Anemometer.                         By Mr John Ranken.
           Communicated by Professor Forbes.
   In laying the results of these observations before the Society, it
was thought necessary to make a few remarks in explanation of
the manner in which they were made.

                                    232
   The instrument consists of a fixed japanned cylinder, on which
the points of the compass are marked, and a moveable portion,
which revolves freely round the cylinder as the wind changes               ;  the
circular disk of a fly kept opposite to the wind by          a weathercock
vane, is made to revolve with a velocity proportional          to that    of the
wind.    The motion thus produced is diminished by means of end
less screws, working in a pair of toothed-wheels, and carried down
to a pencil, which, in its descent, rubs on the surface of the cylin
der, and traces a broad line, whose length         is proportional to the
velocity of the wind, and the time during which it blows from any
one direction taken jointly-     The compartment        of the cylinder on
which the marks are made indicates the direction of the wind.
   It was stated that   the   indications   of this anemometer differed
from those of former ones, in so far as the integral effect of the
wind for any length of time, or the sum of all the elements of the
current, was recorded,    and that the force       of the   wind was taken
into account along with the direction ; thus affording more satisfac
tory data for meteorological speculations.           This instrument was
erected on the roof of the University about the middle            of Novem
ber 1837, and the register, as kept from that          time   till   the 1st of
April 1838, was presented in      a tabular form.
   The method      of reducing     these   results   was   then      explained.
Groups of neighbouring winds were taken, and all the intercardinal
were reduced to the cardinal       points, by using certain multipliers,
found by considering   each intermediate     point as the hypothenuse of
a right-angled  triangle;   the east were     subtracted     from      the west
winds, and the north from the south, and the two resulting effec
tive winds compounded, gave the       mean magnitude      and direction for
the whole time during which the observations          were made.          These
results were given in Tables, and also in the graphical            form.
   The observations with similar instruments at other stations               have
not been published, and therefore       no comparison      of results could
be entered into.

1.  Notice respecting an Intermitting Brine Spring discharging
         Carbonic Acid Gas, near Kissingen in Bavaria.                   By
         Professor Forhes.
   The watering-place       of Kissingen is situated in north latitude
49" 50' east longitude,         50' from Greenwich,      60 English miles
east of Frankfort.      Long before it was frequented for medical pur
poses, its salt springs were turned to profitable account.        Of   these
there are several,     but the one recently enlarged by boring, known
under the name      of the Runde Brunnen, is much more remarkable
than the others, on account of its Copiousness, its Temperature, its
discharge of Carbonic Acid Gas in vast quantity, and its extraor
dinary phenomenon of Intermission.
   The spring rises through         the new red sandstone, of which the

                                              234
valleys in the neighbourhood              of Kissingen are composed, on the left
bank of the river Saal, whose course is marked for many miles by
the occurrence of mineral springs, and by the discharge of carbonic
acid gas.      The author supposes its direction to be connected with
a   line of fissure, and the gas to have its origin in the neighbouring
extinct volcanic focus of the Rhongebirge.
  The present spring was bored for in 1822, and the 4-inch shaft
was carried to a depth of 323 Bavarian feet from the surface ; bnt
at the top it expands into a well eight feet in diameter.     At a
depth   of   156 feet, the water ebbed               for the first time, and it              has
done so since with more or less regularity; but what is particularly
strange     is,   that this regularity appears to depend in a not very con
ceivable way upon the action of the pumps which are employed to
raise the brine           from    the shaft for the purpose                  of evaporation.
Whilst the pumping machinery works, the                               ebb   and flow of the
spring are very regular           ;   when   it   stops, the regularity nearly ceases.
When the spring       in full flow, its appearance
                             is                        very striking.       is

                                                                 is
tated in the most violent manner by the torrents of gas which                                 it
discharges.         Whilst its turbulence          is   at   a   maximum, the gas abrupt
ly   ceases to flow, and in        a   few seconds the surface               of the water in
the shaft   perfectly tranquil.
             is                  The water descends, and continues
to do so, at first rapidly, then more slowly, until   has subsided          it
nine or ten feet, which occurs in about fifteen minutes.      This
point has been         but   just reached, or for    very short time, when
                                                                 a
a   sudden swelling up          of the water first, and then of the gas,                      is
observed in the bottom             ;   the—shaft        fills very slowly, — the flow of
water and         of gas continue for
                                 long time progressively to increase,
                                          a
not apparently attaining their maximum until the water          at its                is
full height, which requires from thirty to forty minutes after the
first return of the stream.    remains in
                                        It    state of violent agita

tion for two hours, or somewhat more, when the preceding                                   cycle
of phenomena      repeated.
                     is       This description applies to the ordinary
state of the spring, when five or six pumps are in action        these            ;   if
are fewer the periods are longer;      more, the reverse.
                                                   if         This Mr
Forbes clearly made out, from registers of observations frequently
verified by himself. Of the natural state of the spring, wheu no
pumps work, he had not the same means of satisfying himself.
There    can be no doubt, however,that, in that case, the periods are
longer and more uncertain, those of flow amounting to three, four,
or five hours, and of ebb to one, two, or three.      Several of the

                                          235
    neighbouring springs appear to partake of the intermittent            charac
    ter, especially as regards the carbonic acid gas which they discharge.
       The temperature       of the spring, many times observed during its
   various phases, was 65° Fahr. very nearly,            and it seemed perfectly
   stationary.     Now,    it appears from direct observations, that the
   mean temperature of the air at Kissingen is about 51°, or 14° lower.
   The author made many observations upon the temperature of
   springs in the neighbourhood, both pure and mineral, which he finds
   to indicate a mean temperature rather lower than the above.              Thus
   the great brine spring, in addition to its other remarkable charac
   teristics,  is distinctly Uiermal.      Nor    can  this  be  ascribed to the
   depth   of the bore through which it       issues, for the spring which rose
  in the same spot before that bore was made had the same tempe
  rature half    a century ago, and     it did not increase during the opera
  tion   of boring.    A  neighbouring      spring, also intermittent    and sa
  line, called the Schonborn        Quelle,    rising through    a bore 550 feet
  deep, has a temperature       of only   52s.
      Lastly, the author     gives   some    account of the products      of the
  spring.     Thirty and     a half cubic inches of almost pure carbonic
  acid gas are combined with one pound of water ; but this gives no
  conception of the vast streams of that substance disengaged by the
  spring during its period of activity, and of which it is difficult to
  obtain the roughest      measurement.        It is collected and applied  me
 dicinally to different parts of the body, in baths suitably arranged.
 The water of the spring is discharged at the rate of from thirty-
 five to forty Bavarian       cubic feet per minute during its full action.
 Its specific gravity is about 1.0157.            The solid matter it contains
 amounts to 22.37 grains in 1000 of water, and consists, according
 to the analysis of Kastner, of 14 grains chloride of sodium, 8.2 mu
 riate of magnesia, 0.5 muriate of lime, 3.3 sulphate of soda, 1.0 car
 bonates of magnesia         and lime, together with        several other sub
 stances in small quantity.        It closely resembles the composition of
sea-water.       The brine is concentrated from 2£ to 17 per cent, by
spontaneous evaporation in dropping through stacks of black thorn ;
and in this process at least 1 80 millions of pounds of water are an
nually carried off in the invisible form by the atmosphere.                The
quantity of pure salt obtained from this spring alone amounts                to
about 28,000 hundredweight           (Bavarian Centner) yearly.

    2.   Notice on the Geology of Gottland,                 from the Observa
         tions of Mr Laing.          By Dr Traill.
    The fine Map of Sweden by Hissenger shews that the greatest
 part of that kingdom, to beyond the 61° N. Lat., may be charac
 terized as   a  vast gneiss formation, skirted on the         SW. and NE. by
 extensive detrital or alluvial formations.
    The gneiss is interspersed with considerable tracts of granite,
 especially in the province of Ostergottland, and here and there ex
 hibits    small portions      of hornblende-rock,      porphyry, quartz-rock,
 mica-slate, and primary sandstone          ; but these rocks scarcely form
 any considerable tracts, and the scarcity of mica-slate is rather re
 markable in a gneiss country.
    The alluvia1 deposits consist of vast beds of clay, sand, and gra
 vel,   interspersed with greywacke-slate           and transition limestone,
with some mountain or encrinal limestone, lias beds, and oolite, and
sparingly dotted with trap-rocks.             The only considerable assem
 blages of these latter rocks are in two patches between the vast
lakes the Wenem and the Wetter n.
    The constitution of the two most considerable Swedish islands,
 Oland and Gottland, are still more simple.              They chiefly consist of
encrinal limestone.
    Gottland    has a  length of about seventy-six English miles, and its
greatest breadth is thirty-four miles.          Its general surface is flat, and
in no point does it rise more than 200 feet above the sea.                About
one-tenth     of its surface exhibits an oolitic limestone, bordered by a
narrow stripe of sandstone on each side; which evidently belongs to
the oolitic formation, from the nature of the organic remains found
in them.

   Specimens of mountain-meal was brought by                         Mr Laing from      the
parish      of Degersfors, on the northern branch of the river Umea
in Umea-Lapmark.                It   was discovered         in   July   1832 by a farmer
in cutting down a tree.               It    forms   a   bed under moss, and has been
used by the natives, mixed with rye-flour, to form bread, and boiled
to make gruel.          Government prohibited it on the idea of its being
unwholesome.
   Dr Traill found that it does not effervesce with acids ; that it
loses by calcination 24 per cent., and becomes more white after first
blackening.        The odour           seems          The microscope
                                                 partly animal.
shews it to consist chiefly of bodies that have the form of elongated
and flattened elliptic bodies, probably the remains of infusoria.
Dr Traill      is analyzing          it,   and considers      it,   from his preliminary
experiments,       to consist chiefly of silica.
   In the       district, in bad years, the farmers make bread of
              same
half rye-flour and half bark? The inner bark of the pine   washed,               is a
dried, and pounded, for this purpose.      Specimens of this bread
were exhibited.

    3.  Notice    regarding some points in Hydrodynamics that
         have been misunderstood.         By Mr Scott Russell.
    This notice is occasioned by a passage in the fifth volume of the
Transactions of the British Association, page 251, in which Pro
fessor Challis claims for himself the merit of having been the first
who deduced from mechanical principles the anomalous emergence
of a floating body from a fluid at high velocities, and where he ad
duces   Mr Russell's experiments in support of the method of rea
soning he has there adopted.        Previous to the publication of his
paper, Mr Russell had given the theoretical explanation of the phe
nomenon, and had also adduced experiments          in support of that ex
planation at the meeting of the British Association in Edinburgh.
The object of this notice is not, however, to argue the claim to
priority of discovery, which the author of this notice considers of
little importance,      provided the truths accordant with the pheno
menon have been rightly determined ; but his present aim is to re
 move certain misconceptions into which Professor Challis has fallen
 in regard to the nature of the phenomenon he has explained,— mis
 conceptions of a grave nature, not merely as regards theory, but
which are likely to produce a most injurious effect upon the prac
tical application of these principles ; for it appears that practical
men have also been led astray by the     authority of Professor Challis's
name, and the imposing apparatus of calculus, which they were not
able either to understand or expose : and, accordingly, we find the
author of the last paper in the first volume of the Transactions of
the Institute    of Civil Engineers misled by Professor Challis, and a
 Mr Woolhouse, who has edited a second edition of Tvedgold on
the Steam-Engine, adopting similar views.
    Now,   as Professor Challis had adduced     Mr   Russell's researches
in support    of his views, he is thus brought in for  a share of respon
sibility for the defect of those views, and has therefore felt it in
cumbent on him to place the question in its true light.
    The following is the passage in Mr Challis's report :
    " The circumstance of floating bodies rising vertically when
drawn with considerable velocities along the surface of the water,
having attracted attention a few years ago, induced me to try to
explain the fact on mechanical principles ; and, accordingly, in a
paper published       in the Cambridge    Philosophical Transactions,    I
have entered on      a mathematical investigation,    which accounts for
such a fact, and shews that, when the velocity of draught is uni

                                        239
  form, the rise is proportional to the square          of the velocity, in ac
  cordance      with  an   experimental    result  obtained   by  Mr Russell.
  This inquiry is not pursued farther in that paper (though I believe
  it may be done according to the method here employed), the im
  mediate object in view being to gain confidence for the particular
  process of reasoning        adopted, by explaining     to a considerable ex
  tent  a  fact which had not before been shewn to depend on received
  mechanical principles."
     On examining Professor Challis's reasoning in the paper referred
  to, and divesting it     of its technical form, it appears to be this ; —
  that  if  you suppose the bow       of  a vessel  to be of a  spherical form,
  or what nautical men term "         a spoon   bow," and conceive it drawn
  through the water rapidly, the force of impact of the bow and the
  water may be resolved into two parts, one of which tends to throw
  the bow upwards, and being a given part             of the whole resistance,
  tends to throw it up with a force proportional to the square of the
  velocity.
     In other words, Mr Challis        has expressed in mathematical       terms
  what was at that time the prevalent and vulgar           error  on   this sub
 ject. It was early supposed by those who witnessed the phenomena
 referred to, that the bow of the boat rose in the manner Professor
  Challis conceives, and, as the immediate inference from this, it was
 considered that the boat whose bow was most nearly of the spoon
 form would        be  that which,   according    to these views, would rise
 most and have least resistance         ;  but, on the contrary,   on building
 boats    of this form which should have the greatest emergence and
 least resistance, according to the view adopted by Professor Challis,
 it turned out that they were the very opposite, and that, on alter
 ing them to the form of the most acute wedge in which, by Mr
 Challis's method, they could have no emergence, and no diminution
 of resistance, they became the very reverse of what had been sup
 posed.      Thus it occurred that     a  very simple experiment put them
 right, and overturned the views of Professor Challis.
     The effect which Mr Challis conceives he has accounted for is
 one of a totally different nature, and indeed the opposite of what
he    has imagined.       It is well known to every one at all acquainted
with the motion of boats, or the theory of their construction, that
a full or spherical bow is violently raised up when propelled at high
velocities    ;  but it happens unfortunately that the stern is violently
depressed,      while the resistance is greatly increased.       Now Profes
sor Challis's view would require the vessel to be wholly raised

                                        240
above tbe statical immersion,          and the resistance   diminished,  — the
reverse     of the fact.   It  is farther proved by experiment,     that when
the emergence which Professor Cballis             has  examined   takes place
to the greatest extent, the resistance is at its maximum, whereas,
according to him, it should be a minimum.
    Whatever      use, therefore,    practical men may be induced to make
of the reasoning of Mr        Challis, it may be expected to lead them to
results the reverse of what they intended.
    The kind of emergence of a floating body from the surface of a
fluid, which Professor Challis states that he was the first to explain
on mechanical principles, is therefore of a different nature from
that which he intended          to explain, and is due only to the peculia
rity of the form of the body.            It is not the kind of emergence to
which any of the phenomena he wished to explain are due.
    The essential principle        on which    Mr Russell  has  explained the
tendency       to emergence of all bodies at high velocities,         indepen
dent   of their figure, is this    : The gravity of a body is the cause and
measure of its displacement.            This gravitation, during a given in
terval of time, is a given constant quantity.           The quantity of fluid
 displaced by a floating body in motion, in virtue         of the gravitating
 force,    is variable, increasing     with the velocity.    The gravitating
force    of  the body  during    a second is a given quantity, acting down
 wards.       The pressure of all the fluid displaced in     a second is ano
ther force opposed to the former, and acting upwards on the bottom
of the vessel.      From    these two forces an equation is formed, which
gives the amount         of emergence depending only on velocity, and
 an expression      results, into which the former does not enter: this
 result was afterwards       confirmed by experiment.
    It  is  only necessary, in conclusion, to state, that these discussions
 have nothing to do with the phenomena of the wave, to which alone
 the chief anomalies of resistance are due.

 I. On the Colour of Steam under certain circumstances.                  By
        Professor Forbes.
    The author accidentally remarked,       that the colour     of the Sun
seen through vaponr issuing from the safety-valve of a locomotive
engine is deep red, exactly similar to that which a column of smoke
or a smoked glass gives to it.
    He next noticed that this colorific character of steam extended
but a short way beyond the orifice, and that it gradually became
more opake, and perfectly white like noon-day clouds, both for
transmitted   and reflected   light.   At moderate thicknesses, in this
state, its opacity is complete.
    These  observations were fully confirmed       by direct   experiments
on high-pressure    steam, made at Glasgow in December            last.  At
the moment of issuing from the steam-cock, it is perfectly trans
parent and colourless   ; at some distance from the orifice it becomes
transparent and orange-red     ; but, still farther   off, it is white, and
merely translucent.     These properties were traced in steam from
a pressure above that of the atmosphere of 55 lb., down to an ex
cess of only three or four; and as in all cases the redness of the
transmitted   light was more or less distinctly seen, (and an excess
of  10 or 15 lb. does as well as any higher pressure), it was con
cluded that the effect of partial condensation in producing        the phe
nomenon, would be rendered visible in great thicknesses           of vapour
of the lowest tension.
    The great analogy of the colour of steam to that which the
clouds assume at sunset, or distant lights       in certain   conditions  of
the atmosphere, lead the author       to suggest this singular property
of condensing vapour     as the probable cause of those phenomena, of
which    no satisfactory explanation could be given whilst this fact
remained unknown.        The prognostics of weather derived from the
colours of the sky also receive elucidation from the fact.
    Judging from the similarity of colour of steam and that of nitrous
acid gas, and the remarkable       power   of absorbing certain definite
rays of the spectrum discovered in that gas by Sir David Brewster,
the author thought it probable that similar lines might be discover
ed   in the spectrum    formed    by light transmitted through steam,
and that these might be found to coincide with the atmospheric
lines of the spectrum noticed by the same philosopher.              The ex
periment    was made with great care,       but the expected result has

                                    243
not been hitherto obtained.       The general action of steam on the
spectrum is to absorb the violet, blue, and yellow rays, finally
leaving only the red and orange, with an imperfect green.
    Since a portion of watery vapour in a confined space, originally
transparent    and colourless, may become, by mere change of tem
perature, first deep orange-red and transparent, and finally white
and seiniopake,     the author notices another analogy with the singu
lar effect of temperature      in deepening the colour of nitrous acid
gas,   and thinks    that these facts may one day throw   some farther
light on the difficult subject of the mechanical constitution of    va
pours, and particularly of clouds.

    The Colours of the Atmosphere considered with reference
         to a paper " On the Colour of Steam under certain cir

                                      244
          cumstances," read at the last meeting of the Royal Society.
          By Professor Forbes.
    The object of this paper was to develope         an application      of the
fact communicated        by the author    on   the 21st January.         It  was
then remarked, that the discovery that steam in a certain stage                of
condensation      is deeply red-coloured    fur transmitted     light, seemed
to offer a probable solution of a difficulty which has never yet been
fairly met, namely, the red colour of clouds at sunset, and the red
ness of light transmitted through certain kinds of fogs.
    A pretty full history of theories proposed to account for the co
lours    of the atmosphere was first given; it was obtained in almost
every case from an examination of the original authorities.               These
theories were reduced under three general heads, exclusively of
that    of Gfithe, and of most writers before Newton, that the blue
colour    of the sky results from a mixture of light and shade; and
that of Muncke, that that colour is merely subjective,          or arises from
an ocular deception.       The remaining theories are       :
    (1.) That the colour of the sky is that transmitted by pure air,
and that all the tints it displays are modifications of the reflected
and transmitted colours.        This is more or less completely the opi
nion of Mariotte, Bonguer, Euler, Leslie, and Brandes.
    (2.) That the colours of the sky are explicable            by floating va
pours acting as thin plates do, in reflecting and transmitting com
plementary colours.        This is the theory of Newton and most of
 bis immediate followers,      and more lately    of Nob'tli.
     (3.) On the principle of     opalescence and     of specific absorption,
 depending on the nature and unknown constitution of floating par
 ticles.    This head   is intended   to embrace the various opinions of
 Melvill, Delaval, Count Maistre, and Sir D. Brewster.
     To the last named philosopher,        however,     the merit     is due of
 having     conspicuously    turned   attention   to  the    important,     com
 plex, and hitherto unexplained         phenomena of absorption, which
 he has proved      to be totally inconsistent    with Newton's theory of
 the colours of Nature, (considered as        those of thin plates) ; and he
 has farther demonstrated the inapplicability        of it in the   case  of  the
 colours    of the atmosphere, by shewing that their constitution is
 wholly distinct from that which any modification of Newton's theory
 would assign, by a series of experiments of which as yet the re
 sults only are announced.
      Since, then, the constitution   of the atmospheric colours analysed

                                                                               i
                                       245
by the prism resembles that produced by absorption, the question
iu, To what medium are we to refer that absorptive action ? Evi
dently not to pure air, since a distant light is red in a fog, and in
clear weather white, or nearly so. The author is disposed to at
tribute the effect to the presence of vapour in the very act of con
                                                                             "
densation.        This intermediate     or colorific stage occurs between
the colourless and transparent form of steam wholly uncondensed,
and that which may be termed the state of proximate condensation
 in which it is seen to issue from the spout of a tea-kettle, when it
is likewise colourless, but semiopake.            During the transition, it
 was shewn in the former paper that steam becomes intensely red,
and remains transparent.           The absorptive action resembles then,
so far, that of the atmosphere observed under certain meteorologi
cal conditions      ; the dark   lines and bands noticed       by Sir David
 Brewster in the atmospheric spectra have not been discovered, and
 so far the analogy is as yet imperfect.*
      In applying this theory to the colours of sunset in particular, the
 author quotes many acknowledged           facts to prove that the redness
 of the sky is developed precisely in proportion to the probable
 existence of vapour in that critical stage of condensation which
should render it colorific.        And he applies the same reasoning to
 account for the prognostics of weather, drawu from the redness of
 the evening and morning sky.

       Some plausible reasons are assigned why these bands should not have
appeared in the experiment as it was made, when steam in every stage of
condensation must necessarily have been present : nor does it seem easy to
 devise a form of experiment free from this objection.      A very important
 observation would bo to examine the spectrum produced by a distant arti
 ficial light seen through a red fog.

1.   Notice of some observations made during the Storm of                    Ja
         nuary 1839.        By John Scott Russell, Esq.
    The author stated, that the paper consisted principally of              com
munications made by members of this society, which had                      been
placed in his hands.        Many points in the statistics of the storm had
been noticed with great accuracy ; and it is important, in the pre
sent promising condition of our knowledge of the statistics and phi
losophy     of this branch of meteorology,        that such communications
should be arranged and preserved,            for the purpose of furnishing
materials for its improvement.           The author went on to explain the
views of the nature of storms            which   had been    successively pro
pounded by Franklin, Espy, Redfield, and Reid.                  He then read
 various communications of observations, from Sir John Robison,
 Professor Christison, Mr Nichol, Mr Stevenson, Professor Wallace,
 Mr Hunter of Thurston, Mr Scott, Sir David Brewster, Mr Rus
 sell,  Mr Bald,     and other gentlemen, who had, with himself, taken
 an   interest   in the subject.      The paper concluded with deductions
 of  a general nature from the facts observed.
 2.   On Fresnel's Law for the Intensity of Reflected and Re
          fracted Light.       By Professor Kelland.
     The object of this memoir was to remove from the molecular
 theory,    difficulties in which the recent investigations      of Mr Green
 appear to involve it.       The    question at issue is the ratio   of the den
 sities of the ether within and without a refracting medium.                 The
 usual mechanical hypotheses would appear to lead to the conclusion
 that the former density is the greater         ;  whilst from the molecular
 hypothesis the latter appears to be the truth.
     In the memoir of Mr Green appears a very strong argument for
 the hypothesis as originally stated by M. Fresnel, together with a
 statement      which   adds force     to the objection,    otherwise     strong,
 against the molecular        theory, viz. that vibrations    are not necessa
 rily transversal.       It will be  found in this memoir, that all the con
 clusions, and all the statements, of       Mr   Green, excepting     only those
 which translate into language his resulting equations, are perfectly
 compatible with the molecular hypothesis, and may be deduced

                                         247
 from it   as easily and   with  as little assumption     as from the other.    It
 is true the author has not endeavoured to give a closer approxima
 tion than that which M. Fresnel himself             has exhibited  to the vibra
 tions which are polarized       in the plane     of incidence ; but, as far as
 the approximation       is carried, it gives precisely M. FresneFs results.
 The want of experiments by which to test even the formulae we do
 possess, is a sufficient reason for delaying farther investigations,
 which shall approach more nearly to the truth in all cases.               In the
 mean time, it is of the utmost importance             that M. Fresnel's   empi
 rical formula should be established,           and his mechanical ones exa
 mined, by different processes.

 1.   On     a    new Galvanic
                          Battery, and an improved Voltameter.
           By Martyn Roberts, Esq. Communicated by Sir John
           Robison.
    Electrical observers have experienced three important defects in
 the common galvanic trough battery, as constructed by Cruick-
 shanks, namely, that the zinc is deposited on the copper plates, that
 the zinc plates become gradually covered                              with   a   coating      of oxide
of zinc, and that   the hydrogen formed by the decomposition of
 water adheres in globules to the surface of the copper; the result
of all which circumstances                       is,   that the galvanic action quickly de
 creases in force.            These inconveniences have been in part removed
in    the battery        of   Professor Daniell,   which the zinc plates are
                                                                in
covered by an animal membrane, and sulphate                                   of copper     is   substi
tuted for acids to form an exciting solution.  Hy the former pre
caution, the deposition of zinc on the copper plates   prevented                      is                      :
and by the latter, hydrogen       no longer evolved so as to ad-
                                                       is
.here to the copper plate.                         These contrivances,            however,          do not
prevent the zinc plates from becoming gradually covered with oxide
of zinc, as in the battery of Cruickshauk and, besides, the improve
                                                                  ;
ments made             by   Professor        Daniell are attended with their own                         in
conveniences in turn.              Copper               is   gradually deposited       on      the zinc
plates   ;      the animal membrane                     obstructs in some measure the free
transmission           of the electric current, and                        also apt to putrefy in
                                                                      it
                                                                      is
no    long time     ;    the cleaning of the plates                   is   troublesome     ;   and the
expense          of employing      a battery                of considerable size must also                be
taken into consideration.
   The author proposes to obviate all the inconveniences hitherto
noticed, by resuming the original construction of (Jruickshanks,
rendering the plates circular and moveable on       common axle,                  a
which      is    turned slowly          by   a    handle at one end of the trough, and
attaching a rubber of cloth along the margin of the trough,     which                          by
the plates are constantly kept clear equally of metal, oxide, and hy
drogen gas.            By this contrivance, the power of                       a   battery may be
maintained without diminution                          for any length of time which                 is   de
sired.       He    has      found that an              equal quantity of water may                  be de
composed in one fourth part of the time      his method, compared     by
with what   required
                  is  when  the plates are left  at rest, so that the
battery      is   converted      into        the battery          of Cruickshanks.             Among

                                         249
    other causes which have appeared to him to contribute                  to the sus
    tained action of his battery,     he has remarked, that considerable            ad
    vantage seems to arise from        the occasional   exposure of the plates
    to the air.
       The voltameter of the author consists of a tube bent like the let
    ter U, which at one end has a glass reservoir attached to      of the    it,
    same capacity with the tube, and at the other graduated end has a
    stopcock to allow the gas to escape upon occasion, which accumu
    lates at that end from the platinum wires evolving the gases at the
    bottom.
    2. Notice   upon the          Alcoholic Strength of Wines.                By Dr

       Various accounts have been given of the alcoholic strength of
    wines     Mr Brande, Julia-Fontenelle, and others. The author
              by
    has been engaged for some time in experiments for determining
    the proportion of alcohol contained   various wines of commerce,
                                                in
    and also the circumstances which occasion a variety in this respect.
    The present paper     an interim notice of the results.

       The method of analysis consisted in the mode                  by
                                                          distillation,
    which was applied with such contrivances for accuracy that nearly
    the whole spirit and water were distilled over without a trace of
    empyreuma, and without the loss of more than between         and         2          6
    grains in 2000.    From the quantity and density of the spirit, the
    weight of absolute  alcohol of the density 793.!), as well as the volume
    of proof spirit of the density 920, was calculated from the tables of
    Richter founded on those of Gilpin.
       The author     has been led to the general       conclusion        that the al
    coholic strength of many wines has been overrated by some expe
    rimentalists, and gives the following table as the result of the                   in
    vestigations he    has   hitherto conducted.    The first column gives the

    In addition to certain obvious general conclusions which may be
drawn from this table, the author stated, as the result of his expe
riments, that the alcoholic strength of various samples of the same
kind bears no relation          whatever       to their commercial value, and is
often   very different        from     what    wonld     be   indicated     by the taste
even of an experienced           wiue-taster.
    Some observations          were next made on the effect produced on
the alcoholic        strength    of wines by certain modes of keeping or
ripening them, more especially by the method employed in the case
of sherry, madeira, and such other wines, which consists of slow
evaporation for a series of years through the cask, above all, in hot
climates.      The researches made by the author on this head are not
yet complete       ;  but he is inclined to infer, from the experiments                   al
ready made, that, for a moderate term of years, the proportion of
alcohol increases in the wine, but afterwards, on the contrary, di
minishes ; and that the period when the wine begins to lose in al
coholic strength is probably that at which it ceases to improve in
flavour.     The increase which takes place at first in the alcohol of
wine undergoing evaporation through the cask, appeared at first

                                      251
view parallel    to tbc  fact generally admitted       on the authority    of
Soemering, that spirit becomes stronger when confined in bladder,
or in   a vessel covered with bladder, in consequence of the water
passing out by elective exosmose.
     The author, however, on repeating the experiments of Soeme
ring, as related by various writers (for he could not obtain access
to the original account of them), was unable, by any variation of
the process he could devise, to obtain the results indicated by the
German anatomist.        Constantly    the spirit, whatsoever its strength,
whether proof spirit or rectified spirit, became weaker.          It was ob
served at the same time, that,      if  the bladder containing spirit was
enclosed in a confined space with quicklime, the spirit slowly be
came absolute alcohol of the density 796, in consequence of u per
 manent atmosphere       of alcohol being speedily formed, while the
 watery atmosphere was absorbed by the quicklime as fast as it was
 produced.      Subsequently it was proved that the bladder was not
 essential to the process : for an open cup of rectified spirit, inclosed
 in a confined space with quicklime, to absorb the water which arose
from the spirit, became in two months absolute alcohol of the den
 sity 796.    Professor   Graham of London some time ago proved the
 analogous fact, that spirit might be thus rendered- pure alcohol in
 the air-pump vacuum.        A vacuum, however, is, upon principle, as
 well as in fact, not necessary for the process      ;  it merely accelerates
 it.   The new method is obviously applicable          on the great scale for
 obtaining absolute alcohol, wherever        time may be allowed.

1.   Notice            respecting       the     Drying-up of the Rivers Teviot,
         Clyde, and Nith, and their tributaries, on the 27th No
         vember 1838.               By David Milne, Esq.
     The phenomenon            was in the first instance described, and certain
views were afterwards offered explanatory                            of it.
     It appears that, betwixt                   10 p. M. on the :26th November,              and
6 a. m. on the 27th November,                       the channels of the Teviot, Clyde, aud
Nith,   becamenearly dry for a great part of their course, so that
scarcely any current flowed in them. All the mills on the Clyde, as
far down as several miies below New Lanark, were stopped from
want of water.             The Nith was nearly dry                    as far down as      Enter-
kitief'oot    ;    and the mills on           it,   and on its tributaries,        were stopped.
This    was the case also on the        The phenomenon was most
                                                    Teviot.
strikingly manifested in the higher parts of the rivers, near their
sources.   The small streams from which they derive their supplies,
were   in general completely dried up.   The rivers, in the lower
parts of their course, were not entirely deprived of their current                               ;
nor were the rivulets, which there supplied them, nearly so much
affected as the rivulets            in   more elevated districts.
   The desiccation continued all the morning, forenoon, and part of
the afternoon ot the 27th November.     When the current was re
stored,  returned not with a sudden rush, but gradually nor when
         it                                                                          ;
the current was restored, did the waters rise much above their or
dinary level.

                                           253
        With reference       to the cause   of' the phenomenon, it was stated,
     that various explanations had been suggested.               Some persons had
     attributed it to the high wind obstructing the flowing of the current ;
     others, to the frost in forming barriers of ice on the caulds or dam-
    heads    ;  others, again, had suggested that the phenomenon might be
    connected with an earthquake.              In support of this last theory, it
     was mentioned, that Professor Phillips had, in a recent work on
    geology, attributed to this cause the drying-up of the English rivers
    Trent and Med way in the 12th century.
        Mr Milne stated that he adopted none of               these views, and that
    he thought the phenomenon           might be accounted for by the united
    action    of  the frost and wind which prevailed during the night of
    the 26th November.            After four o'clock that afternoon,       the ther
    mometer all over the south of Scotland sunk to 26°, at which point
   it remained for several          hours.      Accompanying this frost, there
   was     a   gale of wind from the east,         which    had the effect  of very
   rapidly reducing the temperature of exposed and unsheltered spots.
    In this way, the small and shallow streams flowing in open drains
   and rivulets,      or oozing through       mosses   and marshes in the hills,
   were soon frozen and arrested.               But, on    the  other hand, larger
   bodies of water flowing: rapidly in the main channels, at                a lower
   level, and sheltered by high or wooded banks, could not in the same
   space    of time lose enough of their temperature to be frozen.              The
   waters thus ran oft-, without the usual renewal of supplies from the
   sources, so that the channel or bed of the river became speedily
   drained.
       The reason of this phenomenon not happening more frequently
  appears to be, that there is very seldom a gale of wind in this coun
  try accompanied by          » severe frost  ;  and even on this occasion, the
  frost was not equally intense over the whole island.                 When    a se
  vere frost sets in, there is usually but little wind, so that the water
  in the upper parts of the river, is not liable to be cooled more ra
 pidly than in the lower and more sheltered parts of its course.
 Though the sources will, in that case, to a certain degree, be frozen,
 and so, part of the usual supply cut off, the main body of the stream
 is frozen likewise, whereby the velocity of its current is diminish
 ed, by the obstruction         of the ire   at the bottom and at the surface
of the current.          So that   if only half the usual supply is furnished
to the river from         its partially  frozen sources, there will be no di
minution in the quantity of water flowing               in   the main bed of the

                                     254
river,  if it flows oft' with half its usual rapidity.    This is the ordi
nary way in which frost acts on the rivers in this country.              But
when, as on the night of the 26th November, the frost is accom
panied with a strong and keen wind, which lasts for only a few
hours, it freezes the water in the small rivulets near the sources of
the rivers in high and exposed situations, whilst it has not time to
freeze even the surface of the deeper and more rapid currents flow
ing in the lower parts of the rivers.
   The easterly gale which, by its low temperature, produced this
phenomenon, continued to blow until about 7 or 8 a. m. on the
morning of the 27th November.              The temperature of the at
mosphere then underwent          a sudden change,   as indicated     both by
the barometer      and the thermometer.         This change was brought
about by the advent of two storms, which came from southern lati
tudes, and one or perhaps both of which had, on the morning of the
27th, begun to affect the upper regions of the atmosphere, and load

       Heat.      By Professor Forbes.
   "At    the meeting    of the Society on the 4th February, I remarked,
on  the occasion of Professor Kelland's paper on the Intensity of
Reflected     Light, that it was almost without a parallel in science,
that a quantitative physical law like that of the intensity of the re
flection of light at different angles, should have first been divined
by the rare sagacity     of Fresnel, and confirmed by the very different
but elaborate mathematical investigations which Mr Green of Cam
bridge and Professor        Kelland have applied to the subject, whilst
scarcely any attempt has been made towards           its verification by di
rect experiment.
   " Some critical cases for polarized light were indeed assumed as
the basis of the original formula        ; and   M. Arago    has   confirmed
it by one or two intermediate photometrical experiments : but the
chief evidence for the truth of this remarkable law rests on the in
direct observation of the change of the plane of polarization of an
incident ray after reflection.
   " It occurred to     me, about the end   of 1837, that the anomalies of
photometrical observations       being nearly as unsatisfactory      as ever,
some light might be thrown upon this important            subject by ascer
taining the law in the case of heat, the intensity       of which we have

                                           255
no     difficulty in measuring.        And since the discovery in the case of
heat,     of refraction, single and double, of polarization, of total re
flection, and the change it produces on polarized                  light, as well as
the change        of the plane of polarization       by, simple reflection, there
seems the greatest reason to suppose that the laws                 of reflection for
heat and light,         if  not identical  for both, would       be connected by
some simple analogy.
      " Accordingly, during the month of December             1 887,    1 made some
preliminary observations, which encouraged               me to proceed.         It ap
pears to me, from those observations, that the quantity                   of  heat re
flected from different transparent            bodies is independent, or nearly
so,    of the nature of      the source of heat, and the diathermancy of the
 reflecting body, and that at 55° of incidence the intensity                   of re
 flected heat is nearly that which Fresnel's theory gives.                   The  sub
 stances,     however, were not all prepared           so as   wholly to exclude
 the action       of second surfaces.
      " I have this winter resumed the subject. I have               had an appara
 tus constructed for securing           sufficient accuracy in determining         the
 angle of incidence, and          I have used reflecting surfaces, both trans
 parent and metallic         ; the former are wedges of plate-glass, by means
 of which reflection from the first surface only may be observed, and
  the latter are plane specula         of steel and silver.      The prosecution,
  however, of these apparently simple experiments has been attended
  with unforeseen difficulties ; and although the relative proportions
  of heat at different angles of incidence are now pretty well deter
  mined for glass in several cases, I am not prepared to say whether
  the absolute amount is exactly the same as Fresnel's formula would
  give, assigning to heat its proper refractive index.                 It is satisfac
  tory, however, to know, that the approximation                      to it is much
  greater than        direct photometrical      measures have yet given, with
  the single exception of two experiments               of M. Arago already re
   ferred to    ;  and that    I have reason to believe that the experimental
   law which       Mr Potter     has given from direct observation         in the case
   of light, represents my results much          less accurately than the theory
   of Fresnel.
       " With respect to reflection           at the metals,      I   believe   I  may
   assert that       I  have verified   the remark     of Mr Potter, that           me
   tallic reflection       is less intense at the higher angles of incidence.
    I   have attempted to ascertain whether it reaches a minimum,
   and      then increases up to        90° of incidence, as         Mr Maccullagh
    supposes, but        I  have not obtained decisive       results.      The quan

                                            25(»
tity of heat reflected by the metals is so much greater than Mr
 Potter's estimate for light, as to lead me to suspect that his photo
metric ratios are all too small, which would nearly account for their
deviation from Fresnel's law.
    " The most
                   complete verification of Fresnel's law would be found
in observations made on heat polarized in opposite planes.                         These
 I have attempted, and, so far as they go, they seem to confirm the
analogies of heat and light.             But the intensity is so much reduced
in the process of polarizing, that I fear we must wait for yet more
delicate instruments to measure it.                   In the mean time I may state
the method which            I propose to employ.
    " When heat         is polarized   by transmission through inclined mica-
plates, the polarization         is incomplete ; but         if  the plates be inclined
at the  polarizing angle,         the  transmitted        heat is undoubtedly       com
posed   of  a portion        p polarized     (in  a    plane which we will call +),
and   a portion      1   —p     unpolarized.        This latter part philosophers
are content to consider as compounded                    of a part          —  polarized
+, and   an equal part polarized            —       Now, let the intensity of re
flected heat polarized in the plane of reflection (or — ), and that
perpendicular to it (or +), be represented by the following Table,
which contains the quantities to be found.

    1.  On the Theory of the Motion of Waves.               By Professor
          Kellaml.
    The author proposes, in      a series of memoirs   on  this subject, to
investigate the different      problems of Hydrodynamics, in a manner
which shall carry theory along with experiment.           From the great
attention that has been of late years bestowed on the question of the
motion     of the tide-wave, any mathematical investigation which does
not assume some process of approximation, is extremely interest
ing.     Whilst the more recondite problems of motion derived         from
impulses, &c. have been carefully examined by the greatest philo
sophers of the present day, the more simple and easy ones have been
 left almost untouched.        This may be accounted for by the elegance
 of the process in the former case compared with that to be pur

                                              259
sued in the latter        ; but still it is remarkable           that the most useful
speculations, in a theoretical             point of view, should excite so little
attention.        The author proposes to supply the deficiency here felt,
by examining in detail simple problems of wave motion, in every
possible form of canal or channel, and intends to apply the results
to the motion of the tide-wave, and similar problems.                         The results
which he has already laid before the Society, are merely the intro
ductory steps, comprising the discussion of the general form of
uniform and perfect wave-motion,                   and    an approximative         solution
of the problem of solitary translation.                   In other memoirs,       he hopes
to apply similar processes to incipient motion, retarded motion and
the combination of extraneous forces with internal cohesion.
    2. On a New Method                  of shewing the Unequal Expansion of
           Crystals.         By Professor Forbes.
    This method is founded on the expedient devised by Mitscher-
lich, of obtaining two images of a minute distant object from a sec
tion of a hemitrope crystal of selenite, which is flat when cold, but
is composed        of two inclined surfaces when                heated.      By throwing
the sun's image, reflected from                 such   a   surface, on     a  distant wall,
 the gradual formation             of  the   double image during heating may be
 seen by any number             of  persons.
    3.  On the Diminution                of Temperature with Height in the
            Atmosphere at different Seasons of the Year.                            By the
            same.
    The results communicated to the Society were obtained from
nearly five years of simultaneous observations, made twice a-day
at Colinton and at the Bonally reservoir five miles south-west from

the   sea is 364 feet,         of the latter     1100 feet     exactly; the difference
736 feet.         The mean annual difference of temperature amounted
to  3°.22,     giving 229 feet of ascent for a diminution of temperature
of   1° Fahr.         The influence of the           seasons is briefly shewn by the

    That      the    decrement of temperature               is most rapid      in summer,
and least        so iu winter, has been            long known.         Its   highest value

                                        260
  appears to occur in April or May, and its lowest about November.
   These results are confirmed by the comparative observations made
  at Geneva and the Great St Bernard, where the difference of ele
  vation is no less than 0800 feet.         The reason of this the author
  conceives to be the following.         When we compare the curves of
  annual temperature      at the lower and higher stations, we find the
  following differences.     (J.) The    curve at the higher station is in
 every point lower than that at the other station.            (2.) It   is flatter ;
 the annual range being less.         This  causes the difference      of maxima
 to exceed the difference of minima.            (3.) The curve at the higher
 station is shifted, so that its maximum          and minimum        occur later.
 This    causes the difference between the two curves to attain a maxi
 mum during their rise, and       a  minimum during their decline, which
 corresponds to the fact, and is easily explained          on known meteoro
 logical principles.

          ce  respecting the relative Voltaic agency of Circuits of
         Copper and Zinc, and Zinc and Iron. By Martyn Ro
         berts, Esq.    Communicated by the Secretary.
    While conducting      some   galvanic experiments,       the  author acci
 dentally used    an iron-wire-   V  a  positive electrode, and was sur
 prised to find it was not oxidated, hut, on the contrary, retained its
     ^5^T,rightness,     and  gave out oxygen-gas        from water placed
 under its action, in the same quantity      as a platinum electrode would
 have done in the same situation.
    Struck by this fact, he followed it up by a course of experiments,
 and arrived at the conclusion that iron is in a singularly anomalous
 electric condition,   being positive when compared with copper, and
 yet far more highly negative than copper when compared in their
 electric relation with zinc  ; and that although copper and iron form
 a galvanic combination in which       the iron is positive to the copper,
 yet, when iron is associated with zinc as a galvanic pair, it pro
duces a more powerful current          of electricity  than a galvanic pair
 of equal-size, consisting of copper and zinc.
    A brief notice of illustrative experiments was given.
    The first experiments were made on the 1st January of the pre
 sent year.     A galvanic pair, iron and zinc, immersed in dilute
 sulphuric acid, was connected with two cups of a differential gal
 vanometer    ; another pair, copper and zinc, immersed in acid of the
 same strength as that in which the       iron and zinc    was plunged,   was
 connected with the opposite cups of the galvanometer, both pairs
 being of precisely the same area. The power of the iron and zinc
pair to deflect the needle of the galvanometer, exceeded that of the
copper and zinc pair by 25°.
    The author then constructed two small experimental batteries,
 each consisting of ten pairs, fitted upon Wollaston's plan, the zinc
plates in both of which were 2£ inches square.              One of the bat
teries was a combination of iron and zinc, the other a combination
of copper and zinc.       With the battery of iron and zinc,          a cubic
inch of the mixed gases         was decomposed in seven          minutes, and
with the copper and zinc battery the same quantity required thirty-
three minutes for its formation.       With the former, four cubic inches
were produced in 104 minutes, when the action ceased from neu
tralization of the exciting acid ; with the latter, one cubic inch and
a half were formed      in  125   minutes, and the acid liquor became
neutral.

                                                                   262
   This singular result appears to the author likely to lead to some
new law of electricity, and tends to overturn the present ideas of
galvanic excitation.   An investigation of the details is promised at
some future period.

3. On the Newer        Tertiary or Pliocene Deposites of Scotland.
        By James Smith, Esq. of Jordanhill.
   Mr   Smith of   Jordanhill stated the general results of his obser
vations on the newest tertiary or pliocene deposites of Scotland.
In every one of the maritime counties, elevated marine beds con
taining shells, of which about one-tenth are no longer to be found in
the British seas, have been discovered.           Some of the shells appear
to have become altogether extinct, others occur in crag and Sicilian
tertiary beds, and others in the Arctic            seas, — indicating that the
climate was probably colder at the period           of their deposition.
    The so-called submarine forests, and till or diluvium, lie under
these deposites, and are therefore of still greater antiquity.           Mam
malian remains have been discovered            in them, all of which appear
to differ from recent species.
4.   On certain circumstances affecting the Colour of Blood
        during Coagulation.            By Dr P. K. Newbigging.           Com
        municated by Professor Forbes.
    The author described in this paper certain anomalous appearances
presented by venous blood when left in contact with coloured porce
lain.   When blood drawn from a vein is either allowed to coagu
late in a porcelain cup, or after coagulation is left in it for tome hours,
the dark purple tint characteristic of venous blood is found to be
altered to the bright arterial hue, wherever          it was in contact with
any elevated device      of the green colour, which is communicated by
means of protoxide of chrome.            In one instance the same effect was
produced by a device of a crimson tint; but in more than sixty
trials with this and every other variety of colour used in ornament
ing porcelain,    the author could observe         no such effect as was in
variably   produced    by patterns      of a green    tint.   The effect was
scarcely apparent,    if the pattern was not somewhat elevated.          Mere
elevation   of the porcelain, however,       is not the cause   of the change
of colour.    Adhesion     of  a little oxygen of the air to the surface of
the pattern is not its cause ; for no change is produced by the green
devices of porcelain on a gelatinous mass of gelatin and protoxide

                                    264
of iron, which is quickly rendered brick-red wherever it is put          in
contact with oxygen.       Neither is the change owing to any peculiar
arrangement of the molecules of the blood, because it is produced
equally on coagulated blood and upon that which is allowed to coa
gulate in the cup.      The author is compelled, therefore, simply to
record the fact, that objects on porcelain of a green colour produce
their impression, and this with extreme accuracy, on venous blood
left in contact with them, and that the change of colour which takes
place seems identical with the florid hue occasioned by arterializa-
tion  of the blood from ordinary causes.
5. On two Storms which passed over the            British Islands in the
        end   of November 1838.          By David Milne, Esq. Ad
        vocate.
    It was stated, that the first indication of the advent of these two
storms to the British inlands was given by the barometer.           On the
25th and 26th November,        the barometer in all parts    of the United
Kingdom began to sink ; and it is important to observe, that, not
only when this sinking began, but likewise for nearly two days
after, the wind was blowing E. or NE., and was accompanied by
a severe frost, circumstances     which   of themselves   cause   the mer
curial column to rise.
   The exact hours on the 25th and 26th November at which, in
different places, the barometer began to sink were noticed, from
which it appeared that the sinking took place in the south part of
the United Kingdom about five or six a.        m. on the 25th, and in the
north   of Scotland about two or three in the morning of the 26th.
    I. Now,   as the first storm did not reach England, or, in other
words, that part of the surface of the globe, till about noon on the
26th, and the north part of Scotland till the night of the 27th or
morning of the 28th, it is obvious that the upper regions of the
atmosphere were, in the British islands, affected before the lower
regions    by a period    of about thirty hours.     It follows,* that the
upper part of the storm preceded the lower part, in its progress over
the surface of the globe.
    This first storm commenced at Cork on the 26th, at 11 a.m.;
at Cornwall, about noon ; at Dublin, about 3£ p. M.; at the Isle of
 Man, early in the morning of the 27th ; at Lismore, on the night
 of the 27 th ; and Cape Wrath, not till the 28th November.
    The wind at all these places, on the commencement of the storm,

                                       265
   blew from     SE. or SSE.  ;  it afterwards    veered to    SW., and    on the
   cessation of the storm it was blowing from         N W.      The veering to
   8 W. took place in Cornwall during the forenoon              of the 27th ; it
  took place in Dublin in the evening of that day.
      Heavy gusts came from a point due west, or rather to the north
  of west, shortly before the cessation of the storm.               These were
  felt in Cornwall in the afternoon of the 27th ; they did not com
  mence at Pladda (off the coast of Ayrshire) till the night of the
   28th November.
      From these and other similar data, it          was   concluded,   that the
  storm moved progressively         in a  N.NE. direction,       at the rate of
  ten   or eleven miles an hour.
      The progress of this storm from southern latitudes was next de
  scribed, by reference to various places both on sea and land, as far
  sonth as Gibraltar, at all of which it had been severely felt.              On
  the 22d and 23d,       a storm from     the S. was experienced          at the
 mouth     of the Garonne.      Off the NW. coast of Portugal, three ves
  sels were dismasted by a hurricane       on the 22d     ;  at Gibraltar, there
  was a storm on the 2 1st November.              It was most probably one
  and the same storm which passed over all these places, beginning
 at Gibraltar on the 21st, and reaching the British islands on the
  26th November; — seeing it would arrive there at the very time
 that the first storm begun in England, and had the same direction
 and rate     of movement.
     Some circumstances were stated, shewing             that this storm had
 probably a rotatory     as well as a progressive      motion.     These were,
 (1.) the great velocity of the wind in the storm, compared with the
 actual motion of the storm ; (2.) the veering of the wind in the
 storm from      SE. to N W. ; (3.) the greater violence of the gusts
 from S. and SW., — the progressive and rotatory motions then
 coincided.
     II. The    second storm begun on the       SW. coast of Ireland abont
2 a. m. on the 28th ; at     Cork, about     3  or  4 a. m. ;  Cornwall, about
5   a.m.;    Plymouth, about     9 a.m.; and Fairnborough (near Bag-
shot), about 10 a.m.
    At   all these places there was, during the previous night, a calm,
or light airs from the westward.
    This storm reached Dublin about         1  P. M. on the 28th ;    Glasgow,
about 3 p.m.; and Kirkaldy,          between     4 and 6    p.m.   It travelled
northward, therefore, at the rate of       about twenty miles an hour.

                                         2f,6
     This inference was corroborated by the periods at which, in dif
  ferent places, the wind in the storm veered from SE. to S W.               This
  veering,   which  took   place in Cornwall      about  noon  on  2841, did   not
  take place at Kirkuldy till the oflemoon of the 29//*.
     A  separate and still more striking confirmation            is afforded    by
  the period when the barometer reached its lowest point at different
  places.   Its greatest depression in the Bristol Channel occurred at
  noon on the 28th ; in Edinburgh and Glasgow, at 12 h. 16 m. on the
  29th ; in Kinfauns Castle (Perthshire), at 8£ p. m. on the 29th.
     That this storm     had, like the previous one, a progressive motion
 to N.NE., there      can be no doubt; and from its moving in nearly
 the same track, but travelling with twice the rapidity, it overtook
  the first storm about the middle of Scotland ; in consequence of
  which, the indications of two separate storms became indistinct               in
 these northern parts.
     There were many circumstances shewing that this second storm
 had a rotatory as well as a progressive motion, and that the centre
 of the stormy circle travelled along a path considerably to the west
 of the British islands. (I.) One of these was the greater magni
 tude of the angle made         by the wind in veering, and the greater
 rapidity with which the veering              was effected, in places situated
 to the west, than in places situated to the east.            At Limerick, the
 wind veered 158° in 28£ hours ; at Penzance, 112° in 24 hours;
at Greenwich,      79° in 24 hours   ;   at Kinfauns, 90° in 24 hours.       (2.)
 When the storm         ceased,   the wind was blowing more from the
 north in places situated to the west.           On the west coast of Ireland,
 it was blowing     W. or W.NVV.       ;  in the south-west    of Scotland, and
 at Holyhead,    it was blowing     W.SW. or        SVV.    (3.) The barome
ter was lowest towards the west            ; and by classing together those
 places where the depression        was the same, it appeared that these
places lay in lines or zones running in a            N.NE. direction, in     each
of which the barometer stood at            a  lower level in proportion as its
situation was toward        the west.        In London and Greenwich, the
barometer     stood at its greatest          depression  at 28.70   ;  at Lime
rick, it stood at its greatest       depression      at 27.49,   both observa
tions being reduced for height.              (4.) It was found that a storm
had traversed the eastern part of the Atlantic, moving in a N.NE.
direction, having been felt at the Garonne on the 27th, 28th, and
29th ; at Oporto, from the 24th to the 27th ; at Lisbon, on the
night of the 23d.       It appeared that several vessels in the middle

                                 2G7
of the Atlantic had, on the 28th, been dismasted by a NW. gale,
whilst the Great Western steamer, some degrees to the NW. of
these ships, though on that day and the next she experienced no
gale, enconntered a heavy swell from the   N.NE.
    It appeared from these, and some other data which were de
tailed, that this storm moved N.NE. over the Atlantic, at the rate
of about twenty miles an hour ; that it had also a rotatory motion,
and that the centre of the circle passed very considerably to the
west of the British islands, so that it was only a segment of the
storm which swept over these islands.
    It was mentioned that, before the most furious part of the gale
reached England, and before the barometer       reached its greatest
depression, a storm-wave   had entered the Irish and Bristol Chan
nels, and caused, in most of the harbours there, on the night of the
28th November, an unusually high tide.

 1.   Solution of a Functional Equation, with its application to
         the Parallelogram of Forces and to Curves of Equili
         bration.     By Dr Wallace, Emeritus Professor of Mathe
         matics.
    The functional equation to       be resolved is       this —
                   /(*o)/GO=c {/(*„          + *,) +  /(*-*,)}
 In this equation    xa and xy denote any two values of the indefinite
variable x, and c is a constant quantity.              The object of inquiry is
the forms of the function.
    It is proved that there are     two forms of the function, which alike
satisfy the proposed equation       :   viz.
                  f(x)=a   cos —
                                c
                                                               (1)
                                                •   •   •   ,   (2)
                  /(*)=! {Ae"^}
    In the first of these functions x increases, while f(x)             decreases  ;
and in the second, x and      f(x)    increase together.         The first of these
functions is applied in the paper to the theorem of the Parallelogram
of   Forces, whilst the theory     of Curves of Equilibration is deduced
from    the second function    :  these last, in their most general form,

                                               274
have two parameters.                 The curve of equilibration                       is formed by a
perfectly flexible        chain suspended in                 a   vertical plane between two
fixed points.         Suppose the chain loaded with heavy rods of equal
thickness, which         hang vertically from                    it,   indefinitely     near to each
other, at equal horizontal              intervals, and with their lower ends                       in   a
horizontal straight line.    shewn that the equation to the curve
                                     It   is
isderivable from the functional equation already mentioned, and
that its solution        in   that case gives (putting                   y        to denote the ordi-
nates/      (x) )
                                 =             +
                          f          l{eT e_7}-
   Amongst other curious results, the author establishes     relation                       a
between the arcs of these curves similar to the properties of the
sines and cosines of the circle. It also appears that curves of equi
libration may be constructed                from the catenary, just as the ellipse
is   formed from the circle.            A   series of Tables accompany the paper,
intended to facilitate           the calculations                of engineers for suspension
bridges or equilibrated arches.
2.       On General Differentiation.                     Part          I.     By Professor Kel-
           land.
     "   As early   as the time      of Leibnitz,            was suggested that
                                                        it                                  a   general
form might         be discovered,       for differential           coefficients,        somewhat in
the same way as that which applies to expansions.                                     Notwithstand
ing this suggestion, the difficulty of the subject appears to have
deterred mathematicians from engaging in          until   few years         it,         a
since M. Liouville published    series of memoirs, in which its prin
                                           a
ciples are developed, and theorems deduced applicable to the solu
tion of   variety of difficult and important problems.
            a                                              Amongst a
mass of particular results, the generalization of each of which would
probably give    distinct aspect to the science, M. Liouville appears
                     a
to have selected that one which       the most readily applicable to
                                                   is
practice, and which, at the same time, affords conclusions remark
ably convincing of its completeness.  As far, then, as relates to the
foundation        of the theory, nothing wanting when we examine
                                                        is                   :
the formuhe themselves, we find much room for improvement.         In
the first place, not only are there different formulae for every com
bination        of differentials        of simple quantities,                     but even the very
modes of demonstration               made use       of to produce them, vary widely
from each other.              Certain    of the conclusions themselves also ap

                                      275
pear to be inaccurate.        Added to this is the circumstance, that M.
Lionville has not effected the exhibition of any formulae analogous
to the ordinary formulae of the Differential Calculus, such as Tay
lor's Theorem.
     " The objects of the present memoirs are,        1.  The completion of
the science as regards its elementary theorems, by the exhibition
of one general form, and the deduction of all other forms from it :
2. The application of the general theorem to a variety of cases ana
logous to those dealt with in the common differential                analysis :
and, 3. The demonstration        and application    of theorems of expan
sion, not subject to failure for particular values      of the variable.   To
 complete the subject,      a vast deal more is required    ;  but the author
hopes, by the present essay, and another which he             intends shortly
 to present to the Society, that the study of this important calculus
 will  be excited ; and confidently    anticipates the consequent improve
 ment and extension of its processes."

  1.  Experiments on the Development and Growth of the Sal
           mon, from the exclusion of the ovum to the age of two
           years.     By Mr Shaw, Drumlanrig.            Communicated by
            James Wilson, Esq.
      The author, in this paper, gives an account of the continuance
  and confirmation of his experimental         observations on the growth
  of salmon fry, as formerly communicated to the Society.             He con
  siders the objections made to his artificial ponds, in so far as they
  were supposed to afford an insufficient supply of food, to be with
   out reasonable foundation,     as these ponds actually abound      with the
   ordinary insect food of fishes,      and the young     broods themselves

                                         276
correspond in every way to those of the same age in the natural
streams and pools of the river.   He had previously ascertained
and stated, that young salmon remain in their native river for two
years (under the names of parrs, pinks, fingerlings, &c.), and du
ring that period, or till near its close, he applies to them the name
of parr, as that by which they arc usually designated in Scotland.
   The hatching of the ova is regulated in a great measure by the
temperature of the season.            In severe winters, the principle of life
is slowly developed.   He found, by experiment, that spawn placed
in a stream of spring water of the average temperature of 40°, ex
hibited the embryo fish (visible to the naked eye) by the end of
the 60th day, and was hatched on the 108th day after impregna
tion.   Spawn deposited by the same parent on the same day in the
river (the average temperature of which, for eight weeks, did not
exceed 33°), did not exhibit visible            young until the 90th day, and
131 days elapsed before            their final hatching. Yet the departure of
the more advanced fry sea-tcards does not seem                        to depend on the
variable lime of hatching,         — the first week of May, of the second                  en
suing season, being       a   very regular period for the main body, and on
the occasion in question, large shoals of salmon fry were descending
the river on the very day (10th May) on which the young of that
year were only emerging from the ova. Yet the usual belief                                  is,
that they migrate in the course           of the      same       spring in which they
are hatched.
   Mr   Shaw's paper          is   accompanied       by   an    extensive       and varied
collection   of specimens, which          exhibit the development of the
fry from the period           of hatching until the termination of the se
cond year.   A parr or young salmon twelve months old, mea
sures about three and three-fourth inches in length, and exhi
bits what may be called the ordinary summer                           aspect.    It   corre
sponds in age and size with those which,                  in   the natural      bed   of   the
river, are denominated " May parr," and                    it    is   these latter    alone
(with such as have been recently hatched) that are found in the
river after the beginning of May, as about that period the two-
year-olds all migrate to the sea.   May parr are to be regarded as
identical with the (i Pinks of the river Hodder," alluded to by Mr
Yarrell, but they are the produce of the preceding spring, instead
of being,    as usually       supposed, only     a   few weeks old.               They     re
main all summer, and throughout the ensuing winter, in the river,
and, by an anomalous, or at least unusual, economy of nature, the
males in the course of this early period become fit for generative

                                              277
purposes, and are seen                to associate with the female ad alt salmon.
 A   characteristic       example       of this stage was taken from the pond
 on the    14th November               1838, being      then eighteen     months old,
 and at that age nil           the males of the different       broods exhibited a
matured sexual character in relation                   to the milt, but none of the
 females   of the       same     age shewed any signs of roe.           Those in the
tbed of the river manifested the corresponding character of each
 sex, — that   of maturity in the male, of immaturity in the female.
                 is,
     The great constitutional            change which converts an old parr into
a    young salmon, usually takes place in the month of                  April of the
 second ensuing          year.    Specimens        taken from the pond on the 5th
 of January 1839 measured six inches in length, and were twenty
 months old.  They exhibited all the ordinary characters of the
 parr, commonly so called.                  But such    as were allowed    to survive
 till the 24th        May, although they gained only half an inch in
 length, cast     off (he livery  the parr, and assumed that of the sal
                                       of
 mon, — this change consisting chiefly in the following particulars                 :   the
 black opercular spots disappeared, the almost colourless pectoral fins
 became suffused with an inky hue at their extremities, the broad
 perpendicular         bars or blotches on the sides were effaced, and the
 prevailing hues          of dusky brown and yellowish-white were con
 verted into deep bluish-black                above, and into silvery white below.
 Various other specimens exhibited by Mr Shaw exemplify    simi                 a
 lar change, and some of these distinctly shew, as were, the in    it
 termediateor transitionary state between the parr and salmon.
 The whole, however, belonged to broods which, as formerly ex
 plained    by
           the author, were the original produce of adult salmon.
    The observations hitherto reported were made in confirmation
 and continuance of those formerly laid before the Society by the
 same author.   But the circumstance of the male parrs in state of          a
 sexual maturity          being found to accompany the female adult salmon
 while she deposits her ova in the river, suggested the idea of the
 following singular and successful experiment.     In the month of
 January     1637,       Mr Shaw took          a    female salmon weighing 14 lb.
 from the natural spawning bed, from whence he also took       male             a
 parr weighing one ounce and a half. With the milt of the latter he
 impregnated           the ova   of   the former, and placing the spawn         in the
 stream of his pond he watched its development,                   as he had that         of
 the salmon spawn fecundated in the ordinary way, and found the
 hatching and subsequent growth in all respects to correspond.

                                                  278
These          experiments     were       repeated          with   the same         results   in the
winter of                     (taken, from the river) which had
                  1838, and the parrs
been used as males, were kept alive till spring, when they assumed
the migratory dress of young salmon.                             He also tried      a correspond;
ing experiment, by impregnating the ova of three adult female sal
mon taken from the river, with the milt of three parr bred in the
conGnement    of the ponds, and the result was the same as to suc
cessful hatching and final growth, — this fact, moreover, shewing
the constitutional strength of the pond-bred breed, and that they
had not deteriorated           or   been altered            in their natural        character and
attributes by confinement, as had been                           supposed.     The specimens
used in these experiments                 are exhibited to the Society, that all in
terested may satisfy themselves by ocular inspection.
     One       of these specimens is itself the produce of                           a male       parr
and female adult           salmon     ;   in other          words,       it is what naturalists
(supposing the parr and            salmon not to be identical) would call
a hybrid or mule.               Now, it is admitted by physiologists that
the general rule in regard to these mixed                           productions,       from kinds
not specifically        the same,     is, that they do not breed                ;    yet this male
parr, originally produced from                a   parr and salmon,            has    itself become
the parent         of   a numerous and healthy                   progeny of yonng salmon                 ;
and      Mr     Shaw attaches great importance                      to this fact, the experi
mental particulars           of which are carefully detailed in his paper. It
had, in truth, been           objected to Mr Shaw's former experiments, that
by a forced alliance between the parr and salmon, he had not proved
their identity, but had merely succeeded in producing a hybrid.
The brood, however, in no way differs from other yonng sal
mon in the parr stage, so far as external                            characters are concern
ed   ;   and their procreative            powers        afford      an    additional     confirma
tion of their being identical.                Mr        Shaw moreover               observes, that,
if   the parr were a distinct species, the results of their attendance
on the female salmon would produce universal confusion among the
migratory inhabitants of rivers, " from the circumstance of the male
parrs,     in a breeding state, occupying                     in great      numbers       the very
centre     of the salmon spawning-bed                   ;   while the female salmon her
self     is,   at the same instant, pouring thousands of her ova into the
very spot where they are thus genially congregated."
     Mr    Shaw's- experiments            were conducted with                great care       ;   have
been frequently verified by repetition and have always been fol
                                                             ;
lowed by the same results. He concludes his paper by stating, that

                                          279
so   far                                          or special spawn
           as his own observations extend, the trough,
ing-bed, is excavated by the female alone, and by means of a pecu
liar action of the tail. The belief hitherto entertained has been,
that she was greatly aided in this removal                    and replacing   of the
gravel by the snout and under                 jaw of the male.      The process of
laying usually occupies three or four days. He found in the course
of his experiments, that the death of the female did not (at least
within     a short time) destroy the            vitality of the spawn, or its recep
tive power of fecundation.     He impregnated ova from the body of
a fish which had been dead for nearly two hours, with the milt of a
living parr, and vivification followed in the usual course.
2.   On the use of the word " Temperature" in the Analytical
         Theory of Heat. By Professor Kelland.
  " It appears to the author, that the only fact established by the
experiments of MM. DulotDg and Petit is the following : — That
the scale of measurement                by which we express our knowledge            of
the state of heat within a body, is not applicable to the expression
of the flow of heat within or from the surface of the body. Pro
ceeding upon this supposition, he deduces the thermometric                         tem
perature of a body, from the formulae in v, given by M. Fourier,
taking the formulae as finally obtained,               believing them to be accu
rate expressions of physical conditions.                As, however, the letter v
cannot, consistently with           MM. Dulong        and   Petit's experiments,    de
note the thermometric temperature, but some exponential function
of   the author proposes, in order to prevent confusion, to employ
     it,
the word " thermature" to denote that to which the flow of heat                      is
proportional.    Should his view of the matter be correct, investiga
tions, similar to those given     M. Libri and others, in which the
                                          by
external       radiation only      is   supposed to follow the exponential         law
of temperature,         cease to represent physical facts.          In order, there
fore, to give an air       of probability to the hypothesis, independently
of that which      it      arising out of the nature of the case, the
                        possesses
author has tested       the experiments of MM. Fourier and Biot,
                         it   by
and finds that  applies equally well with the old hypothesis, which
                   it
is confessedly    very close approximation to the truth for small
                    a
differences      of temperature.
                              To complete the test, other experi
ments are wanted, such as those on the state of heat at one end of
a short bar, corresponding to   given state of heat at the other. In
                                          a
this   case,   the old hypothesis totally fails        ;   but from want of   a   suffi

                                      280
ciently definite statement    of the data in the experiment    given by
 M. Biot, the author    is unable to say whether  or not his own views
are confirmed by it.      They certainly are not, as the old hypothesis
 is completely at fault when applied to it. The author hopes that,
by the labours    of some person interested in the subject, this, or
some other expcrimentum cruets, will ere long enable us to decide
 this matter.

1.  On the Effect of the Mechanical Texture of Screens on the
     immediate Transmission of Radiant Heat.                By Professpr
     Forbes.
   The following memorandum was communicated                   at the for
mer Meeting of the Society.
   " On the 2d September         J 839,  M. Arago communicated to the
Academy of Sciences a letter by M. Melloni, containing some very
interesting experiments on the transmission of Radiant Heat. M.

                                         282
   Melloni find*, that rock-salt (which is well known to transmit rays
  from every source with equal facility) acquires, by being smoked,
  the power of transmitting most easily heat of low temperature, or
  that kind of heat stopped in greatest            proportion by glass, alum,
  and (according        to M. Melloni) every other substance.         The ex
  periments contained in the       Third Series of my Researches on Heat,
  shew that this is equivalent        to saying, that substances in general
  allow only the more refrangible          rays to pass ; and as  M. Melloni
  had been led by his previous experiments            to the same conclusion,
  his statement amounts to this, that, whilst rock-salt          presents   the
  analogy of white glass, by transmitting all rays in equal propor
  tions, every substance hitherto examined acts on the calorific rays
 as   violet or blue glass does on light, absorbing the rays of least re-
 frangibility, and transmitting only the others.
      " M. Melloni believes, that the first exception to this rule, or the
 first analogue of red glass, is rock-salt previously smoked.             I de
 sire, however, first to call attention        to the fact, that, in a paper
 published      in May 1838 (Researches        on Heat, Third Series), I de
 scribed a substance having        similar properties, namely, mica split by
 heat to extreme thinness, such as I employ in polarizing heat.              In
 the month of March 1838, I had established, by reiterated experi
 ments, that the transmission         of heat through glass, far from ren
 dering it less easily absorbed by mica in this peculiar state, had a
contrary effect, and also that heat of low temperature, wholly un
accompanied by light, was transmitted almost as freely as that from
a lamp     previously passed through glass.
     " It even appears, from experiments         I have since made with the
same form of mica, that some            specimens transmit scarcely    half as
much luminous heat from a lamp previously             passed  through glass,
as that from a body        below visible incandescence.
    " Mica itself, not laminated by the action of fire,       possesses,  as  I
have shewn by contrasted          tables in the paper referred to   (Art.  23,
24), properties exactly the reverse;         hence the effect is due to the
peculiar mechanical condition of the body, and not to its elementary
composition.
    " It, therefore, at once occurred to me, on reading         M. Melloni's
communication,        that the effect  of smoking the salt might be merely
owing to a mechanical         change in the surface affecting     the trans
mission.
    " Roughening the surface was the most obvious experiment,             and
I  fonnd,   its  I anticipated, that heat of low temperature is very much

                                                    283
easier transmitted by salt scratched by sand-paper in two directions
at   right angles,       than luminous heat.                   Thus,       a plate       of salt which,
when well polished, transmits .92 per cent, of heat derived from a
lamp, and sifted by a glass plate, and also 92 per cent, of heat
wholly unaccompanied by light, transmitted, when roughened, only
17 per cent, of the former and 45 per cent, of the latter.
  " A thin plate of mica, when similarly scratched with emery-paper,
so as merely to depolish                 it,   transmitted much more nearly the same
per-centage of heat from different sources than when bright shew                                ;
ing, that the loss of polish affects the transmission of the more re
frangible rays much more sensibly than that of the others.
   " Yet this effect not attributable to
                               is         variation in the ratio      a                                  of
the reflection          of heat of different kinds at the surfaces of the plate.
For, in the first place,    have proved, and already communicated
                                    I
the fact to the Royal Society (see Proceedings for April 1839),
that reflection takes place at   polished surface, with almost,
                                                a               not                                 if
exactly, the same intensity for all kinds                                of heat    ;   and, secondly,   I
have found,         by   direct experiment, that, at least for the higher angles
of incidence, reflection most copious from rough surfaces for heat
                                    is
of low temperature, or the same kind which      most freely trans              is
mitted, proving incontestibly                    that the stifling action                 of rough sur
faces    is   the true cause of the inequality.
     " That there         is   a real modification          of the heat in passing through
a    roughened surface, as well as                      through laminated mica and the
smoky film, appears from direct experiments which                                       I   have made on
the heat sifted by these different                       media       ;   which, when transmitted
by any one of these,     found in is                 a   fitter state to pass through each
of the others       ;    and this modification             is    found to be more perceptible,
as the character           of the heat         is   more removed from that which these
media transmit             most readily,            that       is,   as the temperature             of the
 source    is   higher.        Thus, heat derived from                    a   lamp, has 36 per cent,
 transmitted        by    a    certain     smoked plate of rock-salt.                         But   if   the
 heat transmitted             by the smoked salt has previously been sifted or
 analyzed          by   transmission           through         another        plate     of smoked salt,
 through        laminated    mica, and through roughened salt, the per
 centage      is   raised from 36 to 44     the two former cases, and to
                                                          in
 40£     in the latter, proving incontestibly                        the specific action of these
 transmissions           in arresting the more refrangible                      rays.
     "I    next considered, that, as                a   moderate number                 of scratches     ap
 peared to produce this modification,                          it    might be practicable           to ob
 tain the effect          by   transmitting heat simply through fine wire-gauze.

                                       284
 I could not obtain it finer than sixty wires to the inch, and in this
 case   I   could obtain no indications   of differences in the transmitted
 ratios of one or other kind of heat.          The proportion transmitted
 to the direct effect, was, in every case, almost exactly that of the
 area of the interstices of the gauze to its entire surface.
    " When fine gratings             for Fraunhofer's interference fringes)
                               (used
 made of cotton-thread        were used, even in this case no difference
 was perceived      ;  here, however,   the thread      having probably  a cer
 tain degree of permeability,       might mask the effect.
    " When fine powders were strewed between salt plates, leaving
minute interstices, the easier transmission of heat of low tempera
 ture was again apparent.
    " Having
                 procured delicate lines to be drawn with a diamond point
 on a polished salt surface, first dividing it into squares 1-1 00th inch
 in the side, then into parallel stripes    1 — i! 00th inch apart, and finally
into squares of the latter dimension,             in every case the effect re
sembled that       of random scratches, and was made apparent as the
surface was move furrowed.
    "  I   have finally to observe, that the mere process of natural tar
nishing by the exposure of salt to the air, produces a similar effect.
    " These facts evidently point to phenomena in heat, resembling
diffraction and periodic colours in light.             I eannot doubt that the
simple transmission through fine metallic            gratings, would  produce
effects similar to those     of the striated surfaces of rock-salt."

 1.   On General Differentiation.       Part   II.  By Professor Kelland.
     " In the preceding memoir    on this subject, the author had confined
 himself to the fundamental        operations    leading   to the differential
 co-efficients of various functions.       In the present paper,      he offers
 an   illustration of the entrance of    such coefficients into the analysis
 of physical and geometrical problems.            Having first established a
 general theorm, connecting      finite integrals    of a certain form with
 fractional and negative differentials, the author adapts it to repre
 sent the integrals actually occurring in several problems.             By this
 means he wishes to shew that the theory of General                Differential
 Coefficients will at some future      period   become a      powerful instru
 ment in the hands of analysts, by furnishing them with results com
 prehended under general forms, and thus opening another section
 of the science of comprehensive memory."
 2.   On the Means       employed to prevent           Forgeries of Bank
           Notes, Bills of Exchange, Cheques, &c. By Dr Traill.
    " The author prefaced his remarks by a short history of Bills of
 Exchange, and other kinds of paper currency ; in which he pointed
 out the economy and convenience of a well regulated paper circulation.
    " The means usually employed to diminish the facilities to for
gery are —
    "   1. Colouring the paper, or the pnlp of which it      is manufactured,
by various vegetable and mineral        substances,    either singly or com
bined.       The best attempts of this sort have         been   imitated  by a
clever hand and a pencil.
    "   2. Certain water-marks in the paper     of the note or bill, as that
employed by the Bank of England.            A good imitation of this would
perhaps require     the connivance of a paper-maker;            but successful
imitations     of water-marks have been made by gum and a pencil,
or by pale tints of China ink to imitate a worn note.
    " 3. Printing notes in different colours, from two or more wooden
blocks, increases the difficulty of forging; instances of this" were
given in the coarse Excise paper stamp, and in the more elegant
L.l    note formerly issued by the Bank of Ireland.

                                      28G
      "  4. The excellence of the engraving — a well executed imitation
  would require the aid of an able artist ; and as engraving on cop
  per and on wood produce these effects by opposite means, if designs
  from both were used on each note, the difficulty of engaging two
  eminent artists in such a nefarious       trade would   enhance the ob
  stacles to successful forgery.     The tracing on copper by an engine
  any series of curves, may easily     be imitated  by what is called en
  gine-turning    ; but the most perfect    specimen   of this sort of  en
  graving is that devised by Mr Perkins.
     " 5. Numbering each note has been adopted by all banks, and some
 number them both with impressions from copper and from wood.
 These have all been successfully imitated ; yet this numbering often
 has led to the detection of forgery.        The numbering-engine, used
 by the Bank of Ireland, is the most perfect which the author has
 seen, combining     speed with accuracy, and registering its own work
  with unerring precision.
     " 6. The signatures of some of the officers of the bank have usu
 ally   been added    to the note, from  the known difficulty of exactly
 imitating a handwriting.
     " 7. Frauds on bills and cheques have been committed by deletion
 of the common ink in which the amount of the bill has been writ
 ten — the substitution     of a larger sum.    The author recommends
the use of an ink, not effaced by chemical agents, without damaging
 the paper.     For this purpose,   he conceives that a carbonaceous ink,
submitted      by him to this Society some time ago, is well suited        ;
especially when used on the softer         kinds of paper, such    as that
made by the engine now used for making           paper in one continuous
sheet."

1.   Observations on the Influence of various circumstances in
        Vegetation in modifying the Physiological Actions of
        Plants. By Dr Christison.
    " The author commenced          with  some remarks    on the various
causes     by which the actions of plants and of their products on the
animal body may be modified, and on the great vagueness and un
certainty of the information at present possessed in regard to the
influence of those causes which seem to arise in peculiar circum

                                        287
     stances of vegetation, more especially climate, weather, soil, and the
     progress of vegetation.     He then stated the sources of information
    on these points, namely, the curative or therapeutic action of drugs
    on man, — their effects on the healthy functions both of man and
    animals, either as medicines or as poisons,     — their sensible qualities,
   — and their chemical     analysis ; and he assigned reasons for discard
    ing the first of these from the inquiry, and for trusting, in a great
    measure, to the criterions derived from sensible qualities, —from
   the effects    of poisons on the lower animals, — and from chemical
   analysis.
       " The remaining part of the present paper was confined chiefly
   to the influence of the Progress of Vegetation on the activity of
   plants.    Doubts were thrown by the results of his investigations
   on most of the current doctrines on this head ; but the present state
   of the inquiry did not lead to any general inferences being drawn
   with confidence.
       " An extended statement was made upon the influence of the
   progress of vegetation upon many of the active species of the natu
   ral family Ranunculacece.      It was stated, that, in the acrid species
   of the genera Ranunculus,       Anemone,    and Clematis,    the acridity,
   which is the same throughout them all in quality, is possessed in
   nearly equal activity by the leaves, from        an  early period in the
   spring until they are about to decay ;     but that it exists in the ger-
   mens only while they are green, and disappears there entirely as
  the seeds ripen.       In the acrid species of Aconilum, the acridity of
  the leaves, on the contrary, continues only until the seeds begin to
  form, and then gradually, but quickly, disappears as they ripen,
  while the    seeds acquire precisely the same peculiar    kind of acridity.
  The narcotic properties of the leaves, however, do not undergo the
  same singular change, but continue undiminished after the seeds are
  mostly ripe, and probably, indeed, as long as the leaves themselves
 retain their freshness.      The acridity of the genus Helleborus is pro
 bably governed by circumstances different from any of those already
 mentioned      ; but the experiments    already made are insufficient to
 point    out the true rule. — In the course of these observations many
 remarks were       also made on the nature    of the acridity possessed   by
the different      species, upon which    incorrect  ideas at present very
generally prevail ; several material corrections were also suggested
as to the general opinions respecting the influence of heat, desicca
tion, and time, upon their acridity ; and a short allusion was made
to the properties of a remarkably crystalline principle which the

                                      288
 author discovered in one     of the species of Ranunculus, and which
 appeared to him to be the ingredient           upon which   the activity of
 that genus depends.
   " The author next entered into some details regarding the influ
 ence  of the progress of vegetation on narcotic plants, and commenced
 with the natural family Amygdalece, the leaves of several of which
are eminently poisonous, in consequence of containing, or producing,
 when bruised, a hydrocyanated essential oil.           He shewed that this
oil abounds most in the leaves of the cherry-laurel ( Cerasus lauro-
cerusus), when they are young and undeveloped, and that it goes
 on diminishing    gradually  in proportion     to their weight, as they in
crease in age and vigour,      until the commencement       of their second
season,   when the old leaves, though        plump and luxuriant, do not
contain above an eighth or tenth        of what they contained in the in
fant state, or of what is contained in the young undeveloped leaves
of the   same period.     This is a complete reversal of the generally-
admitted    law  in  respect of the formation of volatile oils in leaves.
   '*
      The consideration of this fact led to some statements upon the
mode and form in which some essential oils, and other active prin
ciples, exist in the leaves    of plants; and the conclusion was drawn,
that in all probability many active principles,        which  are separated
from plants by simple processes, do not exist ready formed in the
leaves  ;  but, as in the familiar   case  of the mustard-seed and bitter
almond,     are only developed      when the structure      of the leaves is
broken up, and principles of a different kind, secreted in distinct
cells, are brought in contact with one another, or with water.
   " The remaining departments of the investigation were postpon
ed ; but further observations were promised, upon the influence of
the progress     of vegetation on the Solanaceous and Umbelliferous
plants; and likewise on the effects        of soil and climate."
2.   A Specimen of ClavageUa Balanorum (Scacchi), presented
       by Sir Thomas Brisbane, Bart., President of the Society,
       was   laid on the table, with the following Remarks by Dr
       Traill.
   " This is   a rare and interesting     species of ClavageUa, now inha
biting the shores     of Naples, presented by Sir Thomas Brisbane.
   " When that part of Lamarck's work on Invertebrata, which con
tained the class Conchifera;, appeared in 1818, among the order
 Tubicol<c, he introduced    the genus ClavageUa, of which he describes

                                       289
four species only, and they are all fossil.         Even at the conclusion
of his great work, in 1822, he appears not to have known any living
species.
   " Another     species   was described by Sowerby, from a specimen
in the    British Museum, and to these may, perhaps, he added a
fossil species in my cabinet, which occurs in the vast shell limestone
formation mentioned by Humboldt, as extending             to some distance
inland along the shores of the Mexican Gulf.
   " The character of Clavagella is — An animal
                                                        inhabiting a testa
ceous sheath or tube, open, but contracted anteriorly, and club-
shaped posteriorly      ; sheath furnished   with spinous tubes.    Within
the sheath is an equivalve       bivalve   shell, one valve of which is im-
 moveably attached to the sheath, the other free, and united to the
other by    a cartilaginous   hinge.    Both cover the body.     The animal
is an inarticulate mollusque, without head or eyes ; a concealed
unarmed mouth ; a large mantle, with two lameilit'onn lobes.            Ex
ternal bronchial openings placed between the body and mantle on
 each side.
   " It belongs to the division Crassipedes."

       fall near Juvinas, in the Department of the Ardeche in
       France, on the 15th       June 1821.     By Professor Forbes.
   " When visiting the ancient volanoes of the Haut Vivarais, the
author was led to make some inquiries relative to the fall of this
remarkable meteor, which took place in broad day-light, almost
in the midst of the scattered hamlet of Libounez, near Juvinas,
and which was witnessed by many persons, some of whom still
survive, and gave the account which the author presented.
   " The stone fell on the 15th June 1821, at            p. m. ; sky clear,
                                                      4^
and wind north. A long roll was heard, then an explosion like
that of a cannon, five minutes before the stone fell. It touched
the ground within a few feet of several men who were digging
potatoes within a small enclosure.          It perforated a vertical hole
five and a half feet deep, and burnt the ground to a cindery state,
no light having accompanied the noise or the fall.               The stone
had wedged itself between two others, and could not be removed
without breaking it. It weighed 220 pounds.
   " A specimen was exhibited, intended to be placed in the Uni
versity Museum."

1.  On the Persian mode of making Malleable Iron direct from

2.  On the Fatal Effects of        Air   drawn into the Veins during
       Surgical Operations on the Neck and Shoulder.              By Sir
       Charles Bell, K. H.
   " The author referred in this paper to the experience of Baron
Larrey ; also to operations performed by Baron Dupuytren and
M. Roux, who, in removing the arm at the shoulder-joint, heard
the air drawn in, and witnessed the effect in the instant death of
their patients.
   " He noticed the experiments made by the Academie Royal de
 Medicine, and conceived that they regarded too exclusively the
influence of the heart and lungs.         He explained the phenomenon
to be owing to the elevation of the muscles of the neck, by which
the atmospheric pressure was taken off, and the air drawn into
the open vein.
   " Observing that the alternate elevation and depression of the
muscles of the neck attended every act of breathing, he drew at
tention to the circumstance of the entrance of the thoracic duct
into the veins of the neck, whereby it was subjected to the alter
nation of suction and compression.          Noticing at the same time
that, in classes of animals which did not breathe with apparatus
similar to man, the trunk of the absorbent system entered into
other veins, and had a substitute       for the alternate   action of tb#
muscles   of the neck.

                                 294
   " He observed that, granting an action of inhaling by the lungs,
or the auricle of the heart, it would not explain the fact of air en
tering by the veins, since these vessels, having their sides delicate
and pliant, would be sucked together and collapse.
   " He further remarked, on the deadly effect of the air thus enter
ing the circulating system, that it did not satisfy the inquirer to
say that death was produced by impeding the circulation in the
heart, or the oxygenation of the blood in the lungs ; that we must
keep steadily before us the fact that death took place suddenly,
without a struggle or a groan, or one expression of anguish in
voice or feature, — a transition suddenly, and without interval
from life to death.
   " Contemplating the phenomenon thus, there was but one organ
or point which, being disordered, could at once terminate sense
and motion, and voice and expression, viz. the medulla oblongata ;
and he therefore concluded that the air entering the vertebral ar
teries deprived this vital part of arterial blood ; cutting off the
source of all living power and causing death."

1.  On Sulphuret of Cadmium, a New Mineral (first observed
      by Lord Greenock).       By Arthur Connell, Esq.
   " This mineral occurs in small crystals embedded in prehnite, at
Bishoptown, in Renfrewshire.       It had been long supposed to be
a variety of zinc-blende ; but was first distinguished from that mi
neral by Lord Greenock.      Two small crystals of it, sent to the
author for chemical examination by Professor Jameson, appeared
to be six-sided pyramids, and had a wine-yellow colour, conchoi-
dal fracture, splendent and vitreous lustre, hardness about that of
calcareous spar, orange-red streak, and considerable transparency.
   " When heated, it decrepitates, and acquires a fine carmine-red
colour,   and recovers its yellow colour on cooling.      It does not
fuse nor volatilize at a red heat.
   " In powder it is
                      readily soluble in heated muriatic acid, with

                                       '2i>5
  strong smell of sulphuretted hydrogen ; and the solution by evapo
  ration affords a crystallized salt, not deliquescing in an ordinary
  atmosphere.        Carbonate of soda causes in the solution a white
  precipitate, dissolved on adding ammonia. The precipitates by
  potash and by carbonate of ammonia are not dissolved in whole
  or  in part by excess of the precipitants.         Sulphuretted hydrogen
  throws down from the solution with excess of acid, a copious yel
  low precipitate ; and after neutralizing by ammonia, during which
  operation a few flocks of sulphuret of iron fall, a renewal of the
  current of sulphuretted hydrogen causes no farther precipitation.
  Oxalate of ammonia, phosphate of soda, and prussiate of potash,
  cause white precipitates      ; and sulphuric acid does not occasion
  any   at  all.  A  piece of zinc throws down reduced metal as a grey
  ramification. These various reactions sufficiently prove that the
  mineral under examination is sulphuret of cadmium ; and that it
 contains no zinc, and only a trace of iron.
     " The author having obtained a larger crystal, of a reddish-yel
  low colour, and of .similar crystalline form, from Lord Greenock,
  found its specific gravity to be 4.842 at 60°       F. An analysis was
 also effected on 3.71 grains,      principally  of this crystal, by decom
 posing it by fuming nitric acid ; precipitating the sulphur in the
 state of sulphuric acid by muriate of barytes ; and throwing down
 the excess of barytes by sulphuric acid, and the cadmium as a
 carbonate by carbonate of ammonia, and converting it into the
 oxide by ignition.         The constituents were thus found to be :
                 Sulphur,         .         .  22.56
                 Cadmium,         .          .  77.30
                 Iron, traces.
                                               99.86
 Agreeing completely with the theoretical composition of
                 1 Atom sulphur,          .    201.16     22.40
                 1 Atom cadmium,          .    696.76     76.59
                                               897.92     99.99
 The mineral is thus a protosulphuret of cadmium, and is the first
 instance of a separate ore of cadmium, so far as the author knows.
     " It is
             readily distinguished from transparent yellow zinc-blende,
which it resembles, by its orange streak, that of yellow zinc-
blende being white, and by its yielding with soda before the blow
pipe a copious yellowish-red ring of sublimated cadmium, with
no white sublimate. With borax it gives a yellow gloss.
     " The specific name of Greenockite has been
                                                         given to it by Pro
fessor Jameson, in honour of Lord Greenock."

2. On an Optical         Illusion giving the idea of an Inversion of
       Perspective in viewing objects through a Telescope.                By
       Professor Forbes.
   " It has been noticed as a curious fact, first, it is believed, by Mr
Whitwell, that all parallelograms seen obliquely appear distorted
when magnified by a telescope.             The effect is to render the space
between the upper and lower parallel lines apparently greater as
the distance increases, —thus annihilating the usual convergence
to a vanishing point, or even reproducing it in an opposite direc
tion. It is hardly necessary to add, that this Inversion of com
mon perspective       is only apparent; a fact conclusively established
by measuring the angles            subtended    by the two extremities   of a
signboard or a row of windows, when the angle evidently dimi
nishes with distance.
    " The effect of magnifying power in apparently distorting ob
jects, may, on the author's view of the subject, be thus concisely
stated.      The vanishing point of horizontal lines drawn in the
same plane is determined wholly irrespective of the distance be
tween them, or the size of the object to be represented.             Farther,
no   movement      of the   plane   nearer  to,  or farther from, the specta
tor, produces any variation in the position of the vanishing point
in the perspective       projection.      But a telescope which magnifies
an object, a signboard,        for  instance,  magnifies the distance of the
vanishing point from the point of sight in the same proportion.
Hence the perspective is not true for the plane in which the object
actually lies ; and if the eye has taken cognizance of the position
of the plane by previous inspection, it is easy to shew that it must
infer the lines not to be parallel, but diverging from the nearer to
the farther part of the parallelogram.              On the other hand, if the
plane of the object be not previously ascertained, it may appear
 still to be a parallelogram, but situated in a plane more nearly
perpendicular to the line joining the observer's eye and the object
than the true plane.          Both these effects are really observed."

4.   There was also presented by Professor Forbes, on the part
       of R. S. G. Kilbee, Esq., a collection of Fossil Shells,
       from the great deposit near Uddevalla, in Sweden.
   This bed lies from 200 to 300 feet above the level of the sea,
an arm of which extends to that town, but no shells are to be
found upon its shores.         It covers a space of several square miles,
and is coated with soil, which in many places has been removed,
the shells being taken to mend the roads, as well as for building
purposes, and for manure.           Such openings upon the surface are
frequent     on the   hill just above the town, on the road to Gotten-
burg   ;  but a mile or two on that to Wennersburg, and to the
left,  there is a large vertical opening, exposing to view from
thirty to forty feet of the bed's depth, its entire depth being as
yet unknown.
   The mass of shells may be described as hard packed or pressed
together, yet no where consolidated, nothing like order or ar
rangement being perceptible, — neither lines, veins, bands, nor
strata,  — alike  from top to bottom, no earth, sand, or stones inter
spersed.
   The species pecten predominates.            Many of the mussels have
strange     forms;   the   mass   is  free, and is easily separated; many
shells are already broken into fragments of every size, others
delicate and yield to a slight pressure, while others again are
fresh and hard, and clink as sharply as recent shells.

                                 298
    One is struck with their disorder ; they are in every posture ;
the bivalves, which are most numerous, being no where in couples,
nor horizontal, as when inhabited : a multivalve shell, peculiar
to the locality, is in all cases found scattered, its parts being
thrown asunder; the delicate sea-urchin, unable to stand the
rush, is no where     found perfect, though here and there many
small portions may be gathered.
   In short, the shells are as much confused and involved as if
they had been sifted through large meshes ; and thus it would ap
pear as if the whole had been at once thrown into its present po
sition by some mighty convulsion which violently overturned and
interspersed   them.

together with the Hansteen apparatus for horizontal intensity,
were the chief instruments employed by him in a tour through
Germany in 1837, in which (though magnetic investigations did
not form his primary object), he endeavoured to obtain the ap
proximate value of the elements of dip and intensity for several
important stations, and also to carry out into the Eastern Alps
the investigations he had already, in 1832, conducted in Switzer

on the fatal effects of air admitted into the veins of the neck during
surgical operations, in order to make additions.
    " He stated some interesting facts from veterinary
                                                              practice.
But the principal addition he desired to make was the notice of
certain experiments made on the human subject after death, and
which Dr Reid repeated and verified.
    " A small incision being made in the lower part of the neck,
the external jugular vein was found flat ; but an incision being
made into it on raising the shoulder and clavicle of that side, the
vein opened.        On holding open the integuments so that the wound
might hold      fluid, milk was poured into it: the milk remained sta
tionary as in a cup ; but on elevating the shoulder and clavicle,
the    milk descended into the vein and disappeared.
    " The experiment was repeated and varied, but always to the
effect of shewing that, by the elevation of the shoulder and clavicle,
and the mastoid muscle attached, pressure was taken off the veins
of the neck    ; while on the descent of these parts, the fluid sucked
into the vein was conveyed downwards.
    " These experiments Sir Charles maintained fortified the con
clusion to which he had come by process of reasoning in his paper,
viz. that air enters the veins of the neck during surgical opera
tions when the veins are opened, and the patient shrinks and in
 spires deeply."
2. On the        Origin and Progress     of Grecian    Sculpture.    By
           Dr Traill. Part I.
    " The author adduced arguments to prove, that the Egyptians
 were the real masters of the Greeks in the arts of Design.         The
 Greek writers admit that, when their ancestors were barbarous,
 the Egyptian      colonists of Argos and Athens imported with them
 the arts   of a more polished people ; that they brought into Greece
 images of the Gods ; and that the most ancient sculptures men
 tioned by Pausanias and Pliny bore the impress of an Egyptian
 character; especially the wooden statues ascribed by Pausanias

                                 302
to the elder Daedalus and to Attalus, the celebrated colossal statue
of the Amy clean Apollo, and the lions still existing over the gate
of Mycenae.
   " In tracing the progress of Grecian sculpture, the author en
deavoured to shew that     it was possible to divide it into schools
and epochs, in a manner similar to that employed by the Italian
writers on art to discriminate the different schools of painting, by
peculiarities observable in each. From the notices of their sculp •
ture which have reached us, and from existing remains,        he con
ceives that we may distinguish      the following   great schools of
sculpture  :
   "  1. The Egypto-Grecian.
   "  2. The Ionian, including the Samian, Chian, and Rhodian.
   "  3. The Sicyonian, including the Corinthian.
   "  4. The JJginetan.
   "  5. The Graeco-Italian, comprehending the Hetruscan, Magna-
Grecian, and Sicilian.
   " 6. The Attic.
   " 7. The Graeco-Egyptian, or period of the Ptolemies.
   " In this part of his essay the author briefly sketched the two
first schools.   The Graeco-Egyptian is characterized by severity
of style, constrained and little-varied attitudes ; with the chief
care bestowed on the heads and extremities, while the bodies and
draperies are meagre and ungraceful. The Ionian school first
began to give more freedom to the attitudes, to separate the limbs,
and give energy to the figures.    In its later periods it arrived at
 higher excellence   in the most difficult branches of the art, the
union of anatomical precision with grace, and noble composition
in grouping with the utmost energy of action, as is well seen in
the Venus from the Bath of the Pontifical collection, and the Lao-
coon ; which are later productions of the Ionian school.
   " It was this school which introduced into Greece itself the first
 great improvements    on the Egypto- Grecian style."
3.  Account of Earthquakes felt in Scotland during the Autumn
          and Winter of 1839. By David Milne, Esq.
    " I. The first part of the paper described the number and in
 tensity of the shocks felt between the 3d October 1839 and 13th
 April 1840, the point (situated near Comrie) from which they
 emanated, and the distance to which they extended.
    " II. The next part of the
                                paper was occupied with an account
 of the effects, both physical and moral, produced by the shocks.

                                 303
 Under the first class were described the different kinds of injury
 done to walls, according to their direction, and the nature of the
 ground on which they were built. Under the second were men
tioned the alarm felt by the inhabitants of Strathearn during the
great shock of 23d October, as also the quick perception of it by
the lower animals, and the terror they evinced at it.
    " III. The nature of the movement of the earth's surface which
caused the foregoing effects was next noticed, and data were given
illustrating the form of the undulation which was produced. The
noises also that accompanied the shocks were fully described, and
the probable cause   of them stated.
    " Various other concomitant phenomena of an unusual charao*
ter were noticed, such as the evolution of electricity, the diffusion
throughout the atmosphere of something which caused a smell,
variously described as ' metallic,' * sulphureous,' and like the
'
   washings of guns ;' as also the appearance in various parts of
 Strathearn of a fine black powder, which appeared to consist
chiefly of carbonaceous, and partly of siliceous and calcareous
matter.
    " IV. The last part of the paper was devoted to remarks on
the way in which the undulation ' of the earth's' surface was
caused,    and the circumstances    which may     have produced    the
earthquakes.
   " In reference to the first point, various reasons were
                                                             assigned
why the phenomena were more intelligible, on the supposition
that they were caused by vibrations transmitted through the solid
crust of the earth, than on the theory supported by many, that
they were caused by undulations in the body of molten matter on
which the earth's crust may be resting.        These vibrations were
probably caused by ruptures or explosions at a considerable depth
beneath the earth's surface.
   " In regard to the cause of these ruptures, it was observed, that
the hills in the immediate neighbourhood of Strathearn are
 chiefly primitive, and of igneous origin, and that there are nu
merous greenstone    and basaltic dykes,   indicating renewed volca
nic action   at subsequent  periods.    There  are apparently exten
sive fissures in the earth's crust in this part of Perthshire.      It
was also observed, that, during the month previous to the occur
rence of the earthquake, the atmospheric pressure had been great
ly less than usual ; and that the quantity of rain which fell was
almost unprecedented in the central parts of Scotland. There
appeared to be some connection       between the state  of the atmo

                                304
sphere in both these respects, and the occurrence of the earth
quakes, judging from some observations made last autumn, but
more particularly from the frequent   coincidence  of shocks in for
mer years, with a similar state of the atmosphere.       Some views
were offered as to the influence which these circumstances might
have in giving rise to the earthquakes.
  " Notice was taken of shocks which had     been felt in other parts
of Europe, at the time that shocks occurred in Scotland."

                     Monday, 1th December 1840.
       Sir T. M. BRISBANE, Bart. President, in the Chair.
    The following communications were read : —
1.   On certain Physiological inferences which may be drawn
         from the study of the Nerves of the Eyeball. By Dr
         Alison. Part First.
   The principles which the study of the Nerves of Sensation and
of Voluntary Motion within the Orbit is thought to illustrate,
are   : —
   1.   The peculiarity of the muscles of the Eyeball, that they receive
few or no sensitive filaments, such as supply all other muscles of
the body, — coupled with the peculiarity of their office, that they
are designed, in the natural state, to be regulated, not by sensa
tions excited in themselves by their action, but by sensations ex
cited thereby in the Retina, — suggests an important reflection on
the use of sensitive nerves and of sensations in guiding and re
gulating all voluntary and instinctive muscular motion ; the sen
sations which result from the commencing action in every case
fixing the effort of the will on the right muscles, and regulating

                                   30G
the extent to which the contractions shall be carried      ; while ex
perience in some cases, and instinct in others, teaches what mo
tor nerves must act, in order to excite the commencement of these
sensations.
    2. The consentience   of different nerves, and thereby different
muscles,    in the performance of complex actions, — for example,
the exact consentience of the nerves of the same pair on each side
of the body in the acts of deglutition, respiration, coughing, sneez
 ing, vomiting, straining, &c., is partly to be ascribed to the
 cause assigned by Miiller, — the " conducting power of the me
 dullary substance at the roots of the nerves, whereby those which
 lie contiguous to each other are apt to be affected simultaneously ;"
 and this is probably the reason why the action of rolling the one
 eye outwards,    being always intended to be performed simultane
 ously with the rolling inwards of the other, is excited by distinct
  nerves (viz., the 4th and 6th) from those which excite this latter
 movement; whereas the motion upwards and downwards, being
 intended to be performed simultaneously by the two eyes, is ex
 cited through one pair of nerves only, viz. the 3d. But it appears,
 from attending to the actions of the 4th and 6th nerves, —those
  which roll the eye outwards, — that this proximity of origin can
 not be the main cause of consentience of action in motor nerves,
 the opposite nerves of these pairs never acting together in the na
 tural state, but each always acting with a portion of the 3d nerve
 on the opposite side.    And it thus appears, that the truly efficient
  reason of the consentience of motor nerves in all cases, and the
  only one which can be assigned in this case, is the identity of the
  resulting and guiding sensation.
     3.  The remarkable combination of movement observed in the
  actions of the 4th and 6th nerves on one side of the body and of
  a part of the 3d on the other, is conclusive proof that neither con
  nection of nerves at their root, nor union in their course, is con
  cerned in producing such combinations, and that the plexuses of
  nerves cannot be instrumental in producing any of the combina
  tions observed among the muscles of the limbs.
     But the use of the plexuses as to muscular motion becomes suf
  ficiently obvious when we observe, that by this contrivance the
  sensitive nerves of every muscle in the extremities are placed in
  connection with a large surface of the spinal cord, and, therefore,
   probably the guiding sensations resulting from their action are evi
   dently more distinct; and again, that the motor nerves of every
   muscle are connected with a larger surface of the spinal cord, and

                                  307
may be acted on in consequence of the conducting- power of the
medullary substance, more energetically. The muscular sensa
tions being more distinct, and the acts of the will being more en
ergetic, the mind acts on the muscles thus supplied with more
power and precision, and recollects and repeats the action, or suc
cession of actions, with more certainty and uniformity than it
otherwise could have done.
2.   On the Plane and Angle of Polarization at the Surfaces of
       Crystals.   By Professor Kelland.
    The subject of Crystalline Reflexion has been treated by Mr
MacCullagh and M. Neumann ; but both these writers commence
their investigations by assuming that certain equations hold true
at the common surface     of two media.     The object of the present
Memoir is to obtain such equations from mechanical considera
tions.    To attain this, the following hypotheses are made : —
1. That common light consists of vibrations, whose plane of mo
tion is continually changing without law, or is indeterminate.
2. That light, polarized in a given plane, consists of vibrations
perpendicular to that plane.      3. That the media consist of par
ticles at sensible distances from each other, and acting mutually
by a force which varies inversely as the square of the distance.
4. That, at the surface, a portion of the motion is destroyed by
the sudden change from a motion in one direction to a motion in
another. The nature of the medium which constitutes a crystal is
defined by the direction which the ray takes within the crystal, as
compared with its direction without.        By means of these hypo
theses, it is shewn that the following conditions result :— 1. That
the resolved parts of the motion in three directions are at the
 surface the   same, whether   estimated    as belonging to the rays
 without or within the crystal  ;  and, 2. That three other equations,
derived from the former by a simple law of derivation, coexist
 with the above, and with them constitute the equations of rela
tion between     the incident, reflected, and refracted  rays.  These
 equations being solved give the position    of the plane of polariza
 tion as determined by M. Neumann and Mr MacCullagh.             They
give also the polarizing    angle in a form slightly differing from
that obtained by the latter; but differing from it in such a manner
 as to agree (in the point of difference) with the formula of the
 former.

   The following Communications were read : —
1. On     the Polarization of the Chemical          Rays of Light, by

                                  312
          Dr Sutherland, Liverpool.           Communicated      by   the
          Secretary.
    From a series of experiments made last summer, the author in
fers, in confirmation of the results obtained by Young, Berard, and
Arago, that the chemical rays of light are subject to the same laws
of interference and polarization as its luminous rays.
    He found that the two images, produced by the sunbeam, and
also by its extreme violet rays, when refracted through a calc-spar
prism, quickly produce dark impressions, on being thrown upon photo
genic paper, and that the extraordinary ray produces more effect than
the ordinary one. He then observed, by alternately extinguishing
and restoring the luminous rays with an analyzing apparatus of mica-
plates, that the plane of polarization of the chemical rays, as indi
cated by the action on photogenic paper, corresponds     with that of the
luminous rays.     He next ascertained, that, by means of a section of
calc-spar rhomb, the polarized sunbeam, or the polarized violet ray,
could be made to produce, on photogenic paper, a series of pheno
 mena analogous to the coloured rings formed in the like circumstances
 by the luminous rays.     But the effect of the violet rays was not so
perfect as might have been desired, owing to the want of a contriv
 ance for keeping the rays steadily for some time on the same part of
 the paper during the change in the sun's position.
    The author farther found, that the chemical rays may be pola
 rized by reflexion, and then equally exhibit the general properties
 which would be expected from a knowledge of those procured by the lu
 minous rays. The sunbeam , reflected from a mirror of glass-plates upon
 an analyzing plate of flint-glass, and thence on photogenic paper,
 was observed to have scarcely any effect   ;  but when the ray was ren
 dered capable of reflection, either by turning the analyzing plate on
 its axis, or by interposing a plate of mica, a dark impression was
 soon formed.
     Lastly, he ascertained that similar results might be procured by
  means of repeated single refraction, which was accomplished by two
  bundles of mica-plates so arranged in a tube as to admit of the planes
  of the bundles being either placed at right angles to one another, or
  made coincident.    In the former case, the photogenic paper was not
 affected, but in the latter, it was speedily darkened.    By a similar
 apparatus made of flint-glass, he succeeded in obtaining results of the
  samo kind with the light proceeding from the sky.

2.   On the Nutrition of Vegetables, by Dr H. R. Madden,
      Penicuik. Part First. Communicated by Dr Christison.
  The object of the author in this part of his investigation, is to
shew that the portion of the food of plants which they receive from
the soil, and which he endeavours to prove is chemically combined
with it, — although to appearance generically the same in all soils, —
is not composed, as some imagine, of one single proximate principle,
the same in all circumstances, but consists of several principles va
rying in their respective proportions in different soils.    And he far
ther attempts to establish the general proposition,   that the varying
proportion of these principles may be one great cause of the relative
fitness of different kinds of soil for the cultivation or nourishment of
different kinds of vegetables.
   In the course of explaining these views, which were supported
chiefly by speculative considerations, but which the author hopes to
confirm by experimental researches in which he is now engaged, he had
occasion  to refer to the doctrine recently advanced by Liebig, that the
relative fitness of different soils to different plants seems to depend,
not on the organic matter contained in them, but in a great measure
on their relative composition as to saline ingredients corresponding or
not corresponding with the composition and amount of saline ingre
dients in plants.   The author controverts this proposition, and en
deavours to prove by reference to the composition of those soils in
which wheat reciprocally thrives or languishes, that Liebig' s doc
trine is untenable. It is well known that a sandy soil, which, after
one process   of manuring, will raise insuccession an excellent crop of
turnips, barley, hay, and  oats, nevertheless   does not answer at all
well for wheat ; — which, on the contrary, produces most abundantly
on  a clayey soil.   Liebig holds the cause of this difference to be,
that in  sandy soils there is not enough of the saline ingredients,
more especially of potash-salts, which are essential to the constitu
tion of wheat.   The author proves, however, by calculations founded
partly on experiments by Liebig himself, and partly on experimental
researches of his own, that sandy soil, after being properly treated
with farm-yard manure, not only contains a much larger amount of
 saline matters, including potash-salts, than is required for the consti
 tution of a superior crop of wheat-straw and grain, but likewise, that
it actually supplies three times the quantity of salts, and among these,
three times the quantity of potash, required for a fine wheat crop, to
 the turnips, barley, hay, and oats successively raised on   it,   and near

  3.    On the Fossil Fishes of the Old Red Sandstone of Ork
           ney. By Dr Traill.
      The author        stated,   that besides the original localities at Skaill,
  Ichthyolites have been found at Breckness, Quoyloo, and Kirkwall,
  in Pomona, in South Ronaldshay, and in Papa-Westray.                          The spe
  cies already recognised from these localities are, 1. Osteolepis ma-
  crolepidotus.        2. Osteolepis microlepidotus.        3. Cheirolepis Traillii.
  4. Cheiracanthus minor. 5. Diplocanthus crassissimus.                        6. Dipte-
 rus macrolepidotus.           7. Platygnattus    paucidens.        8. Coccosteus latus.
  9.   Plerichthys Milleri.         10. Diplopterus Agassiz.
      All   but the last have been named by M. Agassiz, who determined
 the generic characters from specimens in the author's possession.
 The characters of the Diplopterus Agassiz are the following.                        The
 genus Diplopterus          has   two  dorsal fins,  similar    and    opposite   to  two
 anal fins     ;  vertebrae continued into the upper lobe             of  a nearly even
 tail   ; and a wide mouth armed         with strong conical teeth. It belongs
 to the      Sauroid     family   of  Ganoid   fishes.    The species D. Agassiz
 may be distinguished by a rounded snout ; a large head almost equal
 to a fourth of its whole length ; a single row of trigonal, hatchet-
 shaped scales on the ridge of its back, and oblique rows of rhomboidal
 scales     passing from these to the abdomen ; smooth scales, and the
dorsal and anal fins rounded at their extremities, and composed of
slender rays.
4.    Mr Milne made           a verbal communication             respecting Instru
          ments for registering Shocks of Earthquakes.
     The advantages of registering earthquake shocks were first briefly
noticed.       1.  Such registers      would shew whether,          as   supposed,    the
shocks ^vere morcfrequent and violent during certain states of weather,
and particular months of the year.                If  this were ascertained, some
light     would    be  thrown    on  the cause   of  the shocks, in so far at least

                                      315
that it must be a cause which        can be affected   by atmospheric influ
ences.      2.   They would    serve to shew whether the shocks that occur
in this country coincide in time with those occurring in distant
countries, and whether therefore they all originate from a common
source, or are otherwise connected.   3.        If
                                             there were instruments
placed in different parts of an earthquaking district, the different ef
fects of the same shock on these instruments would lead to the dis
covery not only of the precise spot on the earth's surface where the
shocks were strongest, but likewise of the depth in the earth's crust
from which they emanated.
  The difficulty of devising proper instruments         for registering the
shocks, and especially of measuring their force,       was next alluded to.
As the instruments can only         be made to operate by the movement of
the earth's surface, the precise effects     on the instruments   cannot bo
anticipated, as the nature of that movement is as yet very imperfectly
known.    It seems probablo from the observations made last year in
Perthshire during the most violent shocks, not only that there is a
change of level, but that there is also a slight progressive motion in
the part of the earth's surface affected. In the construction of the
instruments therefore, not only their gravitating tendency, but also
their inertia, must be taken into account.
   With the view of discovering what instruments could be employed
for the purpose of registering the shocks, and of having them set in
proper places, under the charge of careful and intelligent observers,
a committee was   appointed by the British Association at their last
meeting  in Glasgow.
  A number of instruments had been proposed, several of which were
explained ; and three, recently constructed to be sent to Perthshire,
were exhibited.   Two of those exhibited were constructed on a prin
ciple suggested by Professor Forbes, — being an inverted pendulum,
supported by a strong steel spring at the bottom, and loaded with a
weight near the top, so that it should vibrate in the direction of the
shock, whenever the floor of a house to which it may be attached
shall change its horizontal position. The direction and the extent of
vibration are indicated by marks left on paper by a soft black-lead
pencil rubbing against        it,
                         affixed to the upper end of the pendulum.
This instrument and most of the others explained appeared likely to
be affected only by lateral or horizontal movements of the earth's
surface.  One or two were also suggested for the purpose of record
ing the vertical movements.
James Anstruther, Esq. was duly admitted an Ordinary Fel
    low of the Society.

 1.   On certain Physiological Inferences which may be drawn
        from the study of the Nerves of the Eyeball. By Dr
        Alison. Part Second.
    The second part of Dr Alison's paper treated, /rsf, of the in
 ferences which may be drawn from the study of the Nerves of the
 Eyeball, touching the use of the Ganglia of the Sympathetic
 Nerve, which are now generally admitted to have essentially the
same composition as the ciliary ganglion, i. e. to have motor as
well as sensitive filaments from the spinal cord, besides the cords
of communication with the other ganglia.
    In the eye, as in other parts, the muscles supplied with nerves
through these ganglia are muscles of involuntary motion. The
supposition that this or any other part of the Nervous System is
intended     to give tho power of motion to muscles, is quite hypo
thetical    and  opposed by facts ; but there is nothing hypothetical
in the assumption,      that Sensations and Emotions of mind, which
obviously affect the involuntary muscles, must do so through these
ganglionic nerves ; and therefore that the structure of these nerves
and their ganglia must be designed to fit them for transmitting
that kind of nervous action which attends those involuntary acts
of mind, and to disqualify them for transmitting the direct influ
ence   of the will.
    Taking this view of the subject, the following inferences are
considered to be justified by facts       known   as to these   ganglionic
nerves in the eye and elsewhere.

                                    317
    1.  That the vital endowments,        both  of sensitive    and motor
nerves, are much modified by passing through these ganglia, — that
the influence of the   will is not arrested by the ganglia, but is never
felt to be exercised, and cannot be directed downwards to any spe
cific object beyond them, —perhaps only because no distinct mus
cular sensations are transmitted upwards through these ganglia.
    2. That muscles which have their nerves from the ganglia of the
 sympathetic may be affected by changes in the sensitive as well
 as in the motor nerves which enter those ganglia ; and that the
 structure  of the sympathetic nerve is fitted for concentrating on
 these involuntary     muscles what the author      terms Sensorial     In
fluence, as distinguished from the effect     of Volition ; i. e. the influ
ence   of those changes in the nervous system which attend sensa
tions and emotions of mind, and which obviously extend much
 more generally over the spinal cord and nerves than the effects of
 volition do.
    Secondly, This part of the paper stated the appropriation             of
 nerves of the fifth pair to the lachrymal gland, and the effects         of
 section  of that nerve on the nutrition of the eyeball, as clear
 proof, that those sensations and emotions of mind which affect
the secretions and nutrition of the body, act downwards through
 the nerves of common sensation.        The supposition of Miiller and
 others, that the grey fibres of nervous matter are those destined
 to affect these organic functions exclusively, he regards           as hy
pothetical, and opposed by pathological facts ; but he assents to
the opinion   of Dr Marshall Hall, that it is probably with a view
to the influence of emotion and sensation, passing downwards
along the nerves of common sensation, that the ganglia are formed
on the roots   of those nerves.
The Secretary stated the substance of a communication by
       Mr Atkinson, on the subject of Rain-Gauges ; and of
       another on an Instrument for Measuring the force of

    The following Communications         were read   : —
1.   On the Mode in which Musket-balls and other Foreign Bo
      dies become enclosed in the Ivory of the Tusk of the Ele
      phant.    By John Goodsir, Esq. Communicated by Pro
      fessor Syme.
    The author commenced by stating, that " in all the specimens
he had examined, two circumstances were at once detected ; first.
That the balls were enclosed, not in the true ivory, but in an ab
normal structure ; and secondly, that the holes by which the balls
entered were either partially or completely cicatrized in cases of
wound of the socket ; which led him to suppose that, as the tusk
is an organ of double growth, the membrane of the follicle and
the pulp both play important parts in the process of enclosure,
and that there is no regeneration      of true ivory, — an hypothesis
which was afterwards verified by observation.         From a conside
ration of the opinions of Camper, Blumenbach, Lawrence, and
Cuvier, it appeared that doubts are entertained as to the existence
of cicatrices after wounds of the tusk, and opinions held as to the
impossibility of the occurrence of such phenomena in a non-vas
cular substance like ivory. To investigate this subject with suc
cess, two principles must be kept in view : first, that a tusk is
formed from within outwards, as well as from without inwards ;
and secondly, that the ivory and cement are never changed by
vital action in form or substance, after their original deposition."
With these two principles, the author proceeded to explain the
healing of different wounds of the tusk, and the mode of enclosure
of balls and other foreign bodies, by describing in detail the de
velopment and structure of the bony mass which appears in the
 pulp after wounds.     He stated, 1. That wounds of the surface of
 the pulp are followed by ossification round the injury ; 2. That
 the track of n ball across the pulp ossifies at the two extremities,

                                    319
but not necessarily     in the rest of its extent ;  3. That the track   os
sifies when abscess ensues, or when        it becomes fistulous ; and 4.
That balls and foreign bodies are always enclosed in a mass of
ossified pulp.      This ossified pulp, when examined in thin sec
tions under the microscope, presents a formation identical with
the irregular ivory which fills the pulp cavity of the tusks of the
walrus, and the tusk of the cetacea, and consists of anastomosing
Haversian canals, secondary medullary canals, and wavy bundles
of Retzian tubes.       These canals and tubes are situate in a clear
matrix, in which there are occasional patches of coarse cells,
through the medium of which the bundles of Retzian tubes com
municate with one another, and with the tubes of the regular
ivory.     The formation of the irregular ivory which surrounds
 wounds, abscesses, and foreign bodies in the pulp, does not pro
ceed indefinitely, but is limited by the closing up         of the orifices
of the Haversian canals, and the consequent separation of their
contained ramifying pulp from the general system. The irregular
 ivory is then, in reference to the general pulp of the tusk, in the
 same relation as the regular ivory, and at length becomes enclosed
 in the latter by the transformation of the pulp on its surface.           It
 was then stated that foreign bodies enter the pulp in three ways;
  1. Through the base of the pulp, without wounding the ivory ; 2.
  Through the free portion of the ivory ; and 3. Through the sides
 of the socket. A case of the first kind is described by Mr Combe
 in the Philosophical Transactions.         Wounds of the second kind,
  when there is no trace of the track of the ball, have, with the ex
 ception of the formation of the irregular ivory, been sufficiently
 explained by former authors.        In reference to wounds of the third
  kind, Mr Goodsir demonstrated that cicatrices, partial and com
  plete, do occur, and that they are produced by the plugging up           of
  the hole from within by irregular ivory or ossified pulp, and from
  without by cement formed by the membrane of the follicle.               In
  conclusion, it was stated that every case of wound, fracture, and
  enclosureof foreign bodies in ivory, might be explained by the
  facts, that a tusk was an organ of double growth, and that its
  follicle played an important part in the healing of wounds through
  the socket.
  2.   On the Theory of Waves. Part          II.  By Professor Kelland.
     The present memoir is a continuation of that which the author
  presented to the Society in April 1839.           It is divided into four
  sections.    In the first (which is marked Section 4, in continuation

                                   320
of the preceding; memoir) the general problem of wave motion is
treated of, and the equations     to the surface are obtained by two
different processes, giving results which agree with those obtained
in the former memoir.      In the second, the problem of wave mo
tion in a canal of constant width and constant depth in the di
rection of the width, but of variable depth in the direction of mo
tion, is treated by the method of the variation of parameters.      Tho
following are the approximate results : — 1. The length of the
wave diminishes directly as the depth diminishes.          2. That the
velocity of transmission at any point is directly proportional to
the square-root of the depth at that point.      3. That, in a channel
uniformly and gradually shelving, the whole time of transmission
of the wave from end to end, is exactly double what it would be if
the depth were uniform;      and, 4. That the elevation of the crest of
the wave is inversely as the depth of the fluid.
    Such of these conclusions as admit of testing, the author has
 compared with Mr Russell's experiments, given in the seventh
 volume of the Reports of the British Association.       The data are,
 however, insufficient for effecting a satisfactory examination of the
 formula. There is, however, a very general agreement between
theory and experiment.       Section 6th is devoted to the determina
tion of the velocity and force of the wave in a canal, the section
of which, perpendicular to the direction of transmission, is some
 given curve ; whilst the depth estimated in the direction of mo
 tion is constant.   In the former memoir (Section II.) an approxi
 mate solution of this problem had been given, on the hypothesis
 of parallel sections. The conclusions then arrived at agree re
 markably well with experiment, but the hypothesis is too limited
 to be universally applicable.     In the present section, the problem
 of motion is solved in all its generality, and the condition of the
 bounding section is introduced in determining the arbitrary con
 stants.    But, general as the solution in this case appears, it is ne
 vertheless subject to a particular hypothesis, viz., that at the side
 of the canal, and near the surface, the equations of motion are
 continuous.    This hypothesis can hardly be objected to, in all cases
 where the variation of depth is uniform or gradual.          But it to
 tally fails when the variation is abrupt, and can with difficulty
 be conceived to apply when it is subject to much fluctuation. If,
 for instance, the section is triangular, we can have no hesitation
 in applying it ; if, on the other hand, it is triangular at the bot
 tom, and rectangular at the top, it utterly fails.    One remarkable

                                     321
feature in the results is, that the crest of the wave          travels with
the same velocity, whether       at the edges or in the centre of the
canal, provided the wave be of the simplest form.             In a triangu
lar canal, for instance, this is true.        This result would, at first
sight, appear to be utterly at variance with tide-observations;
but the discrepancy will be less striking when it is remembered
that observations of this kind are for the most part made in bays,
or, as it were, small detached channels, and that consequently
the times of high water registered are rarely those corresponding
to the great tidal wave, but to a secondary to it, following at a
considerable   interval.    However this be, Mr Russell states, that
the conclusion coincides exactly with his experiments.              Another
result obtained in this section is, that the square of the velocity
of transmission in a triangular canal is one-half that in a rect
angular canal of the same greatest depth.              This result was ob
tained in the former memoir, and agrees well with experiment.
 On adding further to the hypothesis, that the continuity extends
to small distances below the surface, we find, as the result of
an accurate solution (no longer using an approximation), that
 the approximate result is too great or too small, according as
the breadth     from   the vertical, though the lowest         point to the
edge, is greater     or less than the depth.      The crest of the wave
 rises rapidly towards the shallow part of the fluid.          The last sec
tion is occupied in deducing the circumstances of initial motion
 of a fluid.
  3   Analysis of Berg-Meal from IJmea Lapmark.                     By  Dr
                                   Traill.
    Professor  Traill   gave an account     of the composition of a sub
 stance brought under the name of Berg-Meal from Swedish Lap-
 mark by Mr Laing in 1838.         It was found just under a bed of de
cayed mosses, forty miles above Degersfors,           in Umea Lapmark.
 When examined by the microscope, it was found to consist of several
species of minute organic remains, which Ehrenberg has consi
dered as the siliceous    skeletons .of infusoria  ; the largest measured
 from 0.006 to 0.0005 of an inch.         On analysis, Dr T. obtained
22 per   cent, of organic matter, entirely destructible by a red heat;
and he found the snow-white residue, which           still retained the mi
croscopic forms, to consist     of 71.13 of silica, 5.31 alumina, and
0.15 oxide   of iron.    He considers    the organic matter and the si
lica, as the essential ingredients, and the others probably as ac
cidental.     As a mixture with food, the quantity of organic mat

                                     322
 ter in the Berg-Meal gives it a preference over the steatites and
clays used for a similar purpose by some rude tribes.

Experimental Researches on the Strength of Pillars of Cast Iron,

                            1st February 1841.
             Dr ABERCROMBIE,             V. P. in the Chair.
     The following communications were read : —
1.    On the force of Solar Radiation in the Arctic Regions, by
        Dr Richardson. Communicated by the Secretary.
     Dr Richardson has reduced more carefully           the   Observations
published in the Appendix to Franklin's Second Journey on the
Force of Solar Radiation. From observations on a thermometer in
the shade     compared with those on a thermometer with blackened
bulb in the sun, he finds a tolerably regular daily curve of radiation
having its maximum at noon. But when (after allowing as far as
possible for tho disturbing influonce of the wind) different months
 are compared, it is found that in spring the radiation is more in
 tense than in summer after the disappearance of the snow, which
 Dr Richardson is disposed to attribute to a greater purity in the
 air at the former period.
     Professor Forbes remarked, that, though Dr Richardson's expe
  rience on the superior purity of the air in spring could not be dis

                                     323
puted, yet it would roquire the most direct evidence to counter
balance the probability that the shorter path traversed by the sun*s
rays in summer would have the greater effect in determining their
intensity.    He considers the chief cause of the apparent anomaly
to be, that the presence      of the snow (to which Dr Richardson point
edly alludes), is mechanically effective in reflecting the solar light
upon the sentient thermometer.
2.   An attempt to reconcile the Theories of the Debacle and
        the Action of Glaciers, in accounting for the Distribution
        of Erratic Blocks.       By Sir G. S. Mackenzie, Bart.
     The author commenced by alluding to the disposition of geo
logists to draw conclusions of a general nature too hastily from the
facts observed by them, illustrating this remark by referring to the
various opinions       successively promulgated, not only by geologists
generally, but even by the same geological writer, on the subject
of the till or boulder clay, the gravel, and sand, by which Great
Britain is every where more or less          covered.   At  one period, all
 these   superficial deposits were referred to the action of water alone ;
 now it is the fashion to explain thom by the agency of glaciers.
     In treating of the appearances presented by these deposits, the
 author observes, that those which at first sight might bo thought
 to indicate tranquil deposition from water, might in rgabty be due
 to a different cause.     There is sometimes the semblance of stratifi
cation,    which   arises from an internal    movement     and segregation
 of the different     matters in the   mass.    As  a proof that this phe
 nomenon does often occur, the author         mentioned that, in the old
 ramparts of Tours formed originally of rubbish, he observed that
 in a part where they were cut across to form a road, the materials
 had so arranged themselves as to exhibit stratified beds.
      The author does not offer any positive opinion as to the truth
 of the theory, which implies that the above-mentioned superficial
 deposits are due to the erosion and movement of glaciers covering
 tho whole surface of the country.       Ho mentions, however, one lo
 cality   in Ross-shire, where there are appearances on tho lateral
 rocks of a valley strongly indicative of glacial orosion.
     On the supposition that there are phenomena which indicate
 the action of water as well as of ice, in the formation of these su
 perficial  deposits, the author states the view which occurred to him,
 for embracing both of these agents, to be as follows : — He supposes
 that a volcanic oruption took place in the Icy Sea, some where to
 the north-west of the Brit ish Islands, which had the effect of break

                                        324
ing   up the   ice along the coasts, and       ttiat icebergs or sheets of ice
loaded with      cargoes   of boulders,    clay, and gravel, were driven or
floated over the British         Islands, where they dropped their cargoes,
and, in many instances, stranded on the hill tops.              At this period,
the author supposes that the relative levels of land and sea were
very different from what they are at present, a great part of the Bri
 tish Islands being then submerged.            This theory, the author stated,
 was   not the result of much reflection or observation, and he merely
throw it out for the consideration of geologists.
3. Contributions         to Optical Meteorology.          No. 1. On the Po
       larization of the Light of the Sky. By Professor Forbes.
    The author     began by recapitulating      the observations already made
 known on this subject.
    The   facts generally admitted       (principally  on the authority  of M.
 Arago) appear to be, (1.) That a clear sky reflects light polarized in
planes passing through the sun, the eye of the observer, and the point
of the sky observed.         (2.) That this polarization is a maximum in a
 zone 90° from the sun.          (3.) That in the parts of the sky nearly    op
posite to the sun, this description ceases to be accurate ; for the po
 larization, in a vertical plane passing through the sun and the ob
server, vanishes at an angle with the sun considerably less than 180°,
 — perhaps 150° or 160° (varying according to circumstances), — and
 gradually reappears in a plane perpendicular to the former, at greater
 angles than this.       (4.) That the polarization is more intense in the
neighbourhood of the horizon than of the zenith.               (5.) M. Babinet
 has recently remarked that, under certain circumstances, thero is a
 second neutral point in the neighbourhood           of the sun.
     Professor Forbes has verified these facts in nearly every particular,
 by the aid of a modification of Savait's polariscope, constructed of
 two plates of quartz, peculiarly        cut and combined, together with Mr
 Nicol's single-image calc-spar prism, which the author has substi
 tuted with great advantage for the tourmaline commonly used in
  France.
     With this instrument       he finds,   (1.) That   a uniformly  cloudy sky
  exhibits distinct traces of polarization.        (2.) That rain-clouds gene
 rally polarize light ; but not, so far as he has observed, those charged
 with snow.       (3.) That the common rainbow entirely vanishes in one
 position   of Nicol's   prism (the fact of its polarization was discovered
 by Biot). (4.) That the polarization of moonlight reflected by the
  sky is very sensible, and likewise tho diffuse light, or burr, which
  surrounds the moon in cloudy weather.
                                                   (5.) That the light reflected

                                             325
from dry clear air, between            the observer and objects a mile distant,
is sensibly polarized.
  With respect to the planes     polarization of skylight, he considers
                                       ot-
that they may be represented by a fiction of this kind : That there is
a certain amount of polarization due to the regular reflection of sun
light from the sky in meridional planes passing through the sun and
the observer ; the polarization being most intense towards azimuth
90°, and vanishing atO" and 180°.     Combined with this polarization
is another, distinct from        it,
                             and represented                    by
                                               a more intense effect
due to reflection parallel to the plane    the horizon in all azimuths,
                                                       of
which unitos with, modifies, and even overpowers the regular polari
zation in meridional planes just referred to.
     The result will    be the composition             of the   effects    of the reflection
of light at  concave spherical
               a                             surface having the sun for one pole,
with that due to reflection at          a    cylindrical surface perpendicular to
the horizon.
     If the   latter be tolerably uniform          in   all azimuths,      it   will evidently
overpower and replace the former in points nearly opposite to the
sun, and which become visible when the sun  low.                is
     The author     stated his conception          of the physical         cause for such an
arrangement of the planes of polarization to be, that whilst, at con
siderable elevations, the number of reflecting particles   not so great         is
as near the horizon, the effect due to a single reflection will be the
less intense  and, consequently, the horizontal reflection
                ;                                            generally               is
stronger than  that in any other piano.   But further  than this, many
familiar facts shew that the horizontal vapours (or opaque particles,
of whatever kind they be, which occur in air), are, like a sheet of
paper, capable of receiving light and of emitting                    it,
                                                        not necessarily in
the plane of reflection   and;such light, after several reflections nearly
parallel to the horizon and completely encircling    — as we often sec
                                                                     it,
itdo when a slight whitish haze       visible all round, — reaches the
                                                  is
eye, much enfeebled, no doubt,     numerous reflections, but more in
                                             by
tensely polarized      on that account, and reinforced                    by the number of
the reflecting particles.  The lights thus irregularly reflected or
emitted by the horizontal strata of air, and again regularly reflected
by other particles in the same strata, will come to the eye more or
less polarized in planes parallel to the horizon. A similar action will
produce M. Babinet's second neutral point towards sunset and Mr                           ;
Forbes has remarked generally, after sunset, that the planes of pola
rization no longer converge accurately to the luminary, but are more
or less twisted into  forced parallelism to the horizon.

   The following communications              were read    : —
1.  Farther Researches on the Voltaic Decomposition of Aque
       ous and Alcoholic Solutions.            By Professor Connell.
   Since his last communication to the Society, the author has made
a variety of experiments, with the view of farther testing the truth
of the proposed law which limits tho direct action of the voltaic cur
rent to tho solvent, in solutions of primary elementary combinations
in the more important solvents. All his researches havo farther
confirmed    this law in regard to aqueous solutions.          Amongst those
which he has examined is an aqueous solution of iodic acid as a type
of oxyacids    ;  and ho found that by connecting such a solution mixed
with starch, with a solution of starch in water, by means of asbestus,
no iodine was       indicated when the starch solution was negative, but
was   immediately manifested when the iodic solution was negative
from the reducing action of hydrogen.             In the whole circumstances,
he has no hesitation in concluding,        " that when aqueous solutions of
primary combinations of elementary            bodies are submitted to voltaic
agency, tho dissolved substance is not directly decomposed by the
 current, but only tho solvent."
    From his farther experiments on solutions in alcohol and pyroxy

                                   327
lie spirit, joined to those primarily detailed, he concludes, that " when
solutions of primary combinations of elementary substances, in water
and in those liquids, such as alcohol and pyroxylic spirit, which con
tain water, as an essential constituent, are submitted to voltaic agency,
the dissolved substance is not directly decomposed by the current,
but only the water of the solvent."
   The author had formerly found, that pure ether, and all ethereal
solutions then tried, resisted voltaic decomposition. He has since
ascertained that when ether, charged with dry muriatic acid gas, is
submitted to galvanic action, hydrogen is given off at the negative
pole, whilst chlorine is produced at the positive.  The cause may
either be, that the ether suffers a certain degree of decomposition
previous to voltaic action when charged with muriatic acid gas, as is
indicated by the effects resulting when it is charged with hydriodic acid
gas, water at the same time perhaps being formed, and subsequently
undergoing voltaic decomposition ; or that the hydracid itself, in an
ethereal solution, suffers direct voltaic decomposition.  But as the
author sees no cause to depart from his former conclusion, that ether
contains no water as such as a constituent, he thinks it better not to
include ether in any general rule regulating         the voltaic decomposi
tion of solutions.
  In  order to shew from voltaic action that the haloid salts are dis
solved in water as hydracid salts, the author does not now think it
to be necessary to contrast the results      with those obtained with         alco
holic solutions.   He conceives it    to be sufficient to shew, that acid
and    alkali separate from the aqueous solution of       a haloid   salt, when
the poles aro plunged    in distilled water on each side of          it,   so as to
exclude   asecondary action.      A little    attention   will shew that
                                                                    we
cannot otherwise   account for the separation of the hydracid, when
taken in connection with the facts, that the electro-negative consti
tuent of the hydracid also appears at the positive pole, and a definite
proportion of hydrogen at the negative when the poles are plunged
directly in the solution.
  It                                    solution of chloride of gold
       was found, however, that an aqueous
did not shew acid passing into the connected water with the power
employed; and hence     itprobable that, either from peculiarity of
                             is
atomic constitution or from the feeble affinity of some metals for oxy
gen, their haloid salts do not decompose water.      The test, however,
was found to hold good    in regard to chloride of zinc, and therefore
in all likelihood in regard to all other metals of a more electro-positive
character.     The author believes, that even in alcoholic solutions of

                                    328
moderate strength, an ordinary haloid salt when dissolved, decomposes
the water of the alcohol.
   The conducting power of solutions is, generally speaking, favoured
by the chemical changes which take place in them under galvanic
action.    Salts act by being resolved into their constituent acid and
alkali.   Acids and alkalies, in their separate state, act by being trans
ferred to their respective poles in their aqueous solutions.        Bromine
and iodine are not so transferred    ;  and when they promote the con
ducting power of their solutions, they     act by  uniting with the hydro
gen of decomposed water.
2.  On the Preparation of Paracyanogen, and the Isomerism
       of Cyanogen and Paracyanogen. By Samuel Brown, M.D.
       Communicated by Dr Christison.
   After a short statement of the discovery of paracyanogen by Pro
fessor Johnston, and of its leading properties, tho author proceeded
to shew how,    with certain precautions, cyanogen may         be converted
entirely, or nearly so, into the isomeric form paracyanogen.            This
he accomplished by exposing bicyanide of mercury suddenly to the
temperature most favourable to the production of paracyanogen, which
he found to bo a low red heat, and employing         also pressure, by con
fining the cyanogen gas    which  is at first expelled.    By these means
he succeeded in resolving the salt almost entirely into mercury and
paracyanogen, the latter of which amounted in some trials to more
than nine-tenths of the cyanogen contained in the bicyanide.       The pros-
sure required was not quite two atmospheres, namely 1.74.
   The author further stated, that he had succeeded in proving that
paracyanogen once formed cannot be again converted into cyanogen.
Professor Johnston supposed the contrary, because he obtained cyano
gen gas by exposing paracyanogen to a strong heat. But the author
found that this arose from the latter having retained some cyanogen
by absorption, that after the absorbed gas is removed heat subse
quently expels nitrogen only, and that tho same result is obtained
from the first by using pure paracyanogen, prepared by dissolving the
impure substance in concentrated sulphuric acid, and separating it in
a state of purity by leaving the acid exposed    to the  air so as to attract
humidity.
   To these facts tho author    added some views as to the composition
of cyanogen and paracyanogen,     and  their relation to   one another.    In
order to account for the exceeding difference in properties prevailing
between these two bodies, which appear nevertheless to consist of

                                      329
 the same relative proportions of the same elements, — chemists gene
rally consider the former to consist of one equivalent of carbon and
two of nitrogen (N C«) and the latter of two equivalents of the for
mer and four of the latter (N* O).          But the author endeavours to
shew that the true constitution of paracyanogen is that in which it is
regarded as a compound of two equivalents of cyanogen, that is, of
 two    " equal and similar atoms" of the    same body.
     In   conclusion,  the author proceeded   to apply    these views to the
 constitution of the simple or elementary      bodies ;  and endeavoured to
 shew that there is nothing unreasonable in the supposition, that, — as
chemists are now acquainted with various instances of compound
 bodies which      have widely different forms, different physical proper
 ties in general, and different chemical relations, although agreeing
 exactly in their intimate constitution, — so, in like manner, some of
 those bodies, which are at present accounted elements distinct from
  one another, may really be isomeric, that is, different forms of one
 common element.         And he stated that he hoped to be able to adduce
 experimental evidence of such being the fact with two of the most
 familiar of the elements, which until now have been considered wholly
 distinct."

1.   On the Sea-Level of the Neapolitan       Coast    By Sir John
      S. Forbes, Bart.
   This paper is intended to give an account of the more recent
researches of the Italian antiquaries and geologists connected with
the well-known temple of Jupiter Serapis at Pozzuoli, which have
been verified in several particulars by the author,     by personal
inspection, and extended to other parts of the western coast of
Italy, where traces of marine lithophagi have been found at a
height, as alleged by Niccolini, of even 250 feet above the present
 sea-level.
   The most interesting modern observations are those of Nicco
lini on the actual change of relative level of the sea and land, as
certained by a fixed gauge which he has observed frequently be
tween 1823 and 1838.       In that time the land appears to have
risen through a height of 112 millimetres or 4£ inches ; and this
change has been progressively    and not suddenly effected.

2. On the Supposed Progress          of Human Society from Savage
       to Civilized Life, as connected with the Domestication of
       Animals and the Cultivation of the Cerealia.         By John
       Stark, Esq.
   The object of this paper is to controvert the generally received
opinion, derived from the classical writers, and adopted by most
philosophers, that human society, in its original state, was one
of savage barbarism ; and, that, in the supposed progress from
savage to civilized life, three separate stages or gradations have
been gone through, the one leading necessarily to the other.
These stages, — or the hunter's life, when the food of man was pro
cured by the chase    of wild animals, the pastoral state, when flocks
and herds formed       his chief support, and the agricultural state,
when grains were cultivated, — the author shews never had any
existence, except in the fancies    of poets or the theories of philo
sophers.
   1.  In regard  to the assumption that man was created a dumb
savage, the author states, that such a supposition is neither re
concilable with probability, nor consonant to reason, nor war
ranted by historical records.       If he had been originally dumb,
his race never could have acquired the power of speech ; if he had
been merely a frugivorous animal, his instinctive propensities
would never have led him to feed on animals ; and if such ani
mals were his destined prey, it could never happen, in the ordinary
course of things, that he was to become their protector.         If he
had been created a savage, a savage he must ever have remained.
    2.  With regard to the domestication of animals originally
wild, according to the theories of poets, philosophers, and his
torians, who supposed this to have been the result of ages of ex
periment — an assumption which has remained uncontroverted
till now —the author shews that the supposition of the domesti
cated races ever having been in a wild state, is not warranted by
any thing recorded in sacred or profane history ; that, as far as hu
man history extends, the domesticated animals were man's com
panions ; and that an instinct of sociability, or a particular dis
position to dwell with men, exists in the nature of these animals,
without which all attempts to tame them would have been in
vain. The animals known as domestic were so from the earliest
periods, and no addition to their number has been made through
successive ages.

                                    333
    3.  The cultivation of the Ccrealia, which, according' to the
 philosophical theory, was an invention of civilized man, and the
 result likewise of ages of experiment, — the author asserts to be
 an assumption without the shadow of foundation.             He proved,
 from recorded    facts, that the cultivated grains are nowhere found
growing in a wild state to any useful extent ; that they die out
in a very few years when left to the care of nature alone ; that
their existence depends upon their continued cultivation, and that
their cultivation was known to the progenitors of the human
 race.
    The author considers himself to have established these proposi
tions, 1. That man was at his creation a civilized being, en
dowed with all the physical and intellectual powers necessary to
his state as a moral and intellectual agent ; 2. That the domestic
animals were created for his use, and obedient to his will from
the beginning ; 3. That the cultivation of the Cerealia was
the    earliest  occupation    of the human race ; 4. That prior
to the Deluge      cities were  founded and many of the useful arts
practised ; and, 5. That the survivors of the Deluge started
with all the knowledge of their predecessors, the possession of
the domestic animals, and the grains necessary to their processes
of agriculture.
    In place of the supposed       gradation from savage to civilized
life, the author asserts, from the history and monuments of all
ages and nations, that the general tendency of the race is to de
generate from a civilized to a barbarous state of society.         And
that the desolation of the mightiest kingdoms and republics of
antiquity, — their ruined cities and neglected fields, — teach the
lesson, that neither science nor art, neither philosophy nor re
ligion, has hitherto been effective in stopping this downward
progress, — this descent to barbarism and savage life.

2. On the     Polarizability of Heat from different Sources.    By

    The author of this paper states in it his belief, that the curi
ous fact formerly announced to the Society of the greater permea
bility of mica, laminated by heat, to heat of low temperature,
contrary to the usual character of the same substance (a property
which he has since extended (see Proceedings, Jan. 1840) to
changes of mechanical conditions of surface), may very probably
explain, as M. Melloni anticipates, the difference in point of fact
long contested between them as to the equal or unequal polariza
bility of heat from different sources.
3.   Account of the Fossil Species of the genus Solarium, La
      marck, found in the Supercretaceous group in Italy. By
      M. le Chev. Michelotti of Turin.       Communicated by Dr
       Traill.
    This genus of shells belongs to the Class Gasteropoda of
Cuvier, and to the family Turbinacea of Lamarck, of which the
general character is to have the shell turreted or conoid, with the
aperture rounded or oblong, and the margin disunited.
    M. Michelotti was induced to undertake the examination of
the fossil Italian species of this genus, from the doubts prevail
ing regarding the identity of some of the species in the writings
of authors.    He describes in all ten species, which are found in
the neighbourhood of Turin, of which four have not been pre
viously noticed.    The four newly described species are Solarium
neglectum, S. pulchellum, S. Lyellii, and S. humile.    Two of the
other species described, viz. S.  Stramineum,   Lamarck and S. In
terim, have their living prototypes, — the first in the Indian and
Mediterranean Seas, and the second in the seas of New Holland.
The other species are, —

                              canaliculatum, Lamarck.
   In illustration of his paper, M. Michelotti has sent drawings of
each of the species he describes, in three different positions, so as
to shew all the characters of the shell. The references to au
thors    who have mentioned        the species    (or synonyms)      seem very

       Sir T. D. Lauder, Bart.
    This paper consists of a critical investigation of a recent
paper by Mr Darwin upon this subject, and the author's object is
to prove that Mr Darwin's views are untenable ; and that his own
explanation of the appearances          in Glen-Roy,     given    in his paper

                                     330
  in the Transactions of this Society, and ascribing them to succes
  sive subsidences of a fresh-water lake, is still the only view re
  concilable with the facts.

  2.    On the Visibility of rapidly revolving Lights, made in re
         ference to the Improvement of Light-Houses. By Alan
          Stevenson, LL.B , Civil Engineer.
      These experiments consisted in a comparison of the visibility
  of lights from lenses when at rest, and when revolving with such
  rapidity    as to produce    an apparently continuous     impression on
 the sense    of sight. They were undertaken at the suggestion of
  Captain Basil Hall, who had himself in the spring of last year
 made some trials of a similar kind, in the expectation that the
 eye would be so stimulated by the bright flashes, that not only
 the almost imperceptible intervals         of darkness would have no
 effect in impairing the visibility of the rapidly recurring flashes,
 but likewise the eye would actually be stimulated by the contrast
 of light and darkness, in such a manner that the effect of the
 rapid series would be greater than that of the same quantity of
 light equally distributed over the whole horizon by the refracting
 zones at present used in fixed lights, which only refract the light
 in the vertical direction, without interfering with its natural ho
 rizontal divergence.       Mr Stevenson shewed that this expectation
 was at variance with what would be predicted from a considera
tion of the laws of the physical distribution of the light; and the
experiments       proved that the visibility   of the rapidly revolving
 series was greatly inferior, not only to that    of the lens at rest, but
also to that    of the light equally distributed by the refracting zones.
From the results of the experiments, the author drew the follow
ing general conclusions : —
     1 . That continuity of impression in the sense of sight is scarcely
obtained by producing ten flashes in a second of time ; and that
the visibility of the light decreases in a most remarkable degree
with the velocity of the series.
     2. That this decrease of visibility, although partly owing to a
loss of intensity, is chiefly caused by deficiency of volume in the
visual object, which at the most rapid velocity became so small

                                    337
 that few observers at the distance of fourteen miles could detect
 it with the naked eye, while the light from the zones was large
 and distinct.
    3. That the rapid passage of the visual object over the eye
 causes this decrease in its volume, by diminishing the amount
 of irradiation, which, according to the theory of M. Plateau, is,
 within certain limits, proportionate to the duration of the impulse
 of light in the retina.

    The following Communications          were read  : —
 1.  On the Theory and Construction of a Seismometer —an
       instrument for Measuring Earthquake Shocks and other
       Concussions.       By Professor Forbes.
    The plan of this instrument was submitted amongst others to
a Committee of the British Association appointed to devise means
for registering earthquake shocks. A heavy pendulum, suspended
from a frame, will evidently have its bob left behind by its
inertia when the frame is moved forwards by any concussion.
To render such an instrument very sensible, however, the pendu
lum must be of great length, which presents many inconve

                                   338
nienoea in practice.     The author, therefore, proposed an inverted
pendulum, sustained by a steel wire, on the principle of the noddy
invented by Mr Hardy, for ascertaining the stability of clock
cases.     The balance of gravity and elasticity (which act,
the former to displace, the latter to redress, the pendulum) may
be rendered     as  nice as we choose, and hence the sensibility      of
the instrument is wholly independent       of its dimensions.
    The author has shewn, by a mathematical investigation, that
the extent of deviation due to a given concussion, within mode
rate limits, depends solely upon the time of vibration of the pen
dulum, — that, for any sudden forward motion of the machine, the
 greatest displacement of the bob of the pendulum may become
equal to that motion, — but     if the motion   continue uniformly for
 a short space and then cease,     the displacement may      be doubled
 in amount.
    The self-registering part of the apparatus consists of a pencil
 at the extremity of the inverted pendulum, which travels over a
 prepared concave surface of paper, and marks at once the direc
 tion and extent of the displacement of the pencil, which is evi
 dently contrary to the movement of the ground. The author also
 points out how, by varying the position of the bob upon the rod
 of the pendulum, and at the same time altering the elasticity of
 the spring, the deviation of the pencil may be increased in any
 proportion to the actual movement of the ground, and this irre
 spectively of the dimensions of the instrument.
    Lastly, he shews how, by employing two instruments of the
 same kind, but whose sensibility (determined by the time of one
 vibration) differs in a known proportion, the duration of a shock
 and the extent of lateral movement of the ground may be cal
 culated ; and he gives a table for this purpose.       It is to be un
 derstood, however, that this and other results of the mathemati
 cal investigation are only true in so far as the fundamental hypo
 thesis is correct, — viz. that an earthquake is a lateral movement of
 the ground in one direction, through a short space, and with a
 uniform velocity.
    Similar instruments might, no doubt, be applied to measure the
 lateral concussions of railway trains.

2. On the     Circulation of the Blood, and the Difference of the
       Laws of Fluids moving in living and dead tubes. Part I.
       By Sir Charles Bell.
    The author commenced with a eulogy of Mr Hunter, and of
his experiments upon the arteries ; and proceeded to illustrate
the elasticity and muscularity of an artery.
    The author's   experiments   were made on the human frame, by
taking advantage      of the amputated limb on the instant of its
separation   from the body.     He made a section of the artery so as
to present a piece in the form of a ring, — he slit this ring, and it
sprang open to a certain extent. Putting it in water, it was
found in the morning reversed or bent the other way.       On taking
a larger portion of the artery, which was straight, and slitting it
up, it immediately bent backwards in a semicircular form.
    The author gave this explanation of these facts : — On the cir
cular portion of the artery being cut up, the elastic power pre
 vailed to a certain degree ; but continuing to be opposed by the
circular muscular fibres until the vital power was exhausted, then
the elasticity so entirely prevailed as to bend the ring in the re
 verse position.
    But on slitting up the long straight piece of the artery, it im
 mediately curled back, for there are no longitudinal muscular
 fibres to prevent the elasticity having instant effect.
    The author then went into a description of the different mode
 and time of action of the muscular fibre, shewing that we must
 not retain the idea first presented to us in the voluntary muscles,
 but contemplate the same property of action in the muscular fibre,
 where   it enters into the composition   of particular organs, and
 when it is made subservient    to the function, acting in a different
 time and mode, and being sometimes not excitable by acrid or
 mechanical stimulus : hence inferring, that we must not expect
 to excite the muscular coat of an artery by irritating it as we
 might do a voluntary muscle.
    The author took a portion of an artery of a square form, and
 found that, by appending weights, it was equally elastic in all
 directions; on which he argued, — Since the artery is full of blood
 when it receives the systole of the heart, on the acknowledged
 laws of hydraulics, that an impulse upon fluids is propagated
 equally in all directions, it must follow that the artery dilates in
 the transverse as well as the longitudinal direction.

                                     340
   He proceeded to shew, that,        as the  artery is elastic, the impulse
of the heart cannot reach every branch at the same moment, —
that undulations, or partial distention, must characterize the pro
gress of the heart's impulse along the artery.
   He argued against the opinion that there is no other quality
than that of tonicity in the circular fibres of the artery.                For
tonicity, according to the definition of physiologists, being a per
manency of action, which admits of no relaxation, it would fol
low that the artery had two properties exactly the same; for
tonicity and elasticity would present exactly the same kind of re
sistance to the blood impelled by the heart.
   But, —granting to these fibres the vital property of muscularity,
— since the healthy action of a muscular fibre is characterized by
relaxation as much as by contraction, we perceive that the higher
muscularity of the extreme vessels implies that they are more easy
of dilatation, as well as more powerful in contraction ; and that
the dilatation and contraction of successive portions          of the artery
must, like an increasing wave, bestow a higher degree           of activity in
the vessels remote from the heart.           Sir Charles deferred the read
ing of the Second Part of his paper.

  1.  Experimental Researches on the Production of Silicon from
        Paracyanogen.         By Samuel Brown, M.D.              Communi
        cated by     Dr Christison.
     In his paper on Paracyanogen read to this Society at an earlier
 period of the present session, the author announced that he con
 sidered he had succeeded in proving, that two familiar bodies, uni
 versally believed to      be distinct elements, are modifications of one
 and the same elementary form.             In the present paper,      he an
 nounced that the bodies in question are carbon and silicon, and
 gave a detailed statement of the investigations by which he had
 been led to this conclusion.
     1. Silicon may be obtained from uncombined paracyanogen. —
 When paracyanogen, prepared from bicyanide of mercury by heat
 under pressure, as described in his former paper, was subjected to
 prolonged heat in a closed tube of German glass, a dark-brown
 substance was obtained, which presented all the diagnostic cha
racters    of silicon. More especially, it was incombustible before the
blowpipe, underwent no change on being projected into fused
chlorate of potash, but dissolved with effervescence in fused car
bonate of potash, forming a white saline substance, in which silica
was detected by its ordinary reagents.            The same experiment
was performed with the like result on a larger scale in a porcelain
crucible ; and the quantity of silicon produced came within a very
small amount of the carbon contained, by theory, in the paracy
anogen employed.           When paracyanogen is heated with carbonate
of potassa, silicic acid is obtained at once. A variety of experi
ments were described, the purpose of which was to obviate all fal
lacy that might be supposed to arise from silica being present in
the vessels employed.
    2.  Siliciurets may be obtained by the reaction of paracyanogen
on metals         When bicyanide of mercury was heated in tubes

                                    342
 of copper or iron in the way followed for obtaining paracyanogen ,
 the interior of the tubes was found to be lined with scales, which
 consisted, not of paracyanide or carburet of these metals, but of
 their siliciuret.   And when paracyanogen was heated in a pla
 tinum crucible several times in succession till the crucible would
 absorb nothing more, a compound was obtained which was a sili
 ciuret of platinum, containing four per cent, of silicon.
    3. When paracyanogen is decomposed in the preceding experi
 ments, the nitrogen given off corresponds with what is contained
 by theory in the compound which yields it.      A variety of experi
 ments of analysis were mentioned to this effect ; from which a
 further corroboration was derived of the conclusion derived from
 the author's previous researches, that the silicon could come only
 from the carbon    of the paracyanogen.
    4.  A siliciuret may be obtained from the paracyanide of iron.
 Under this section, the author first described the process by which
 a pure paracyanide     of iron may be obtained from ferrocyanide of
potassium ; and stated that he had found this compound to consist
of one equivalent of nitrogen, two of carbon, and one of iron.    He
then observed that he had been led to suppose this compound to be
the true compound radicle of the so-called ferrocyanides ; on which
subject he proposed to make ere long a distinct communication to
the    society.   He next proceeded to explain the results of nu
merous experiments      on the influence of heat on the paracyanide
of iron ; from which it appeared that, under a high temperature
and pressure, a compound was obtained, in which carbon could
not be detected, but instead of it silicon, in the proportion of 28.5
per cent. To these remarks were added others on ferrocyanide
of potassium, which he considers to be resolved in the process
into cyanide of potassium evolved by sublimation, and paracy
anide of iron, which at the same time is decomposed, and yields
disiliciuret of iron. The product obtained in these two ways is
in general partly in the form of a coaly powder, partly in fused
obsidian-like masses. But if the ferrocyanide of potassium be
heated with its own weight of cyanide of potassium, as a non-re
active flux, the disiliciuret is obtained in a semicrystalline form,
which in fine powder is colourless, and is seen before the micros
cope to be transparent like glass; and sometimes there is an
approach to a crystalline form, nay, small particles may be dis
covered with the microscope which are regular octahedres.        The
disiliciurets of iron thus produced were treated of by the author in

                                  343
his Inaugural    Dissertation in 1839, as carburets of the metal.
(See Trans. Brit. Assoc. 1839, vol. ix.)     Experiments were added
under the present section, which satisfied the author that every
conceivable source of silicon, except from the paracyanogen, was
provided against by the manner in which the experiments of con
version were performed.       Among other facts thus elicited, it ap
peared, that, by successive operations in the same vessel, a greater
weight of disiliciuret of iron might be obtained than the weight of
the vessel itself.
   5. Silicic acid may be obtained by a direct process from the
paracyanide of iron. The conversion thus accomplished might
appear, as the author conceived, more satisfactory to most per
sons, than any of the previous operations, on account of the large
scale on which the experiments were performed.         When paracy
anide of iron was mixed with four times its weight of carbonate of
potash, and ignited in a shut crucible of hammered iron for four
hours at a full white heat, a rose-red saline product was formed,
from which a transparent solution was obtained with water ; and
when this was supersaturated by hydrochloric acid, a bulky pre
cipitate was thrown down, which, when purified from adhering
metallic oxide by fusion with carbonate of potash, solution of the
product in water, neutralization with hydrochloric acid, evapora
tion, desiccation, and ignition, and elutriation with water to
remove chloride of potassium, — presented all the distinctive cha
racters, physical as well as chemical, of silicic acid. Five grains
of paracyanide of iron thus gave 3.04 of silicic acid ; and 30
grains of ferrocyanide of potassium, similarly treated, gave 5.4
grains of silicic acid.   The iron crucible used in these operations
did not yield a particle of silicic acid when heated to a white heat
with pure carbonate of potash,— the same salt employed in the
preceding cases of conversion.         A large crucible was worked
seven successive times with 9334 grains in all of ferrocyanide of
potassium ; and 1240 grains of silicic acid were produced.
    The author added that, in the course of several of these opera
tions, more especially those of the last section, he found the iron
to undergo conversion    as  well as the carbon ; and in a subsequent
paper he proposes to state in detail the facts which lead him to the
conclusion that this metal is a variety of the same elementary
form with rhodium.

2.   On the Anatomy of the Amphioxus lanceolatus of Yarrell.
      By John Goodsir, Esq. Communicated by Professor Syme.
     After a short statement of the labours of Yarrell, Couch, Ret-
zius, and Miiller, the author gave a detailed description of the
structure of Amphioxus, as observed in the dissection of one of two
specimens taken by Mr Forbes in the Irish Sea.        The abdominal
folds, and the anterior and posterior anal fins, were described, and
the existence of a fin in front of the anus illustrated by an obser
vation made by Professor Agassiz, of the temporary existence of
a similar fin in the embryos of certain fresh-water fishes.
    The osseous system presented two divisions, — the true or
neuro-skeleton,   and the intestinal or splanchno-skeleton.      The
true skeleton consisted of a chorda     dorsalis, equally pointed at
both extremities, without the slightest trace of a cranium, and
destitute  of any of the peripheral vertebral elements, with the ex
ception of a row of cells — germs of interspinous bones and fin-rays
— along the base of the dorsal and anal fins. The tissue of this
neuro-skeleton was not even cartilaginous, consisting merely of
membrane and globular nuclei, derived from the original elemen
tary cells. The splanchno-skeleton consisted of a hyoid apparatus,
and of 70 to 80 pairs of elastic filamentous ribs.     The hyoid ap
paratus^ —                                             —
            in two divisions, with 17 pieces in each exhibited 34
rays, pointing inwards, and each springingfrom one of the 34 basal
elements   of the hyoid hone. These rays the author looked upon
as developments       of the tubercles and teeth of the central
aspect of the branchial apparatus of the higher fishes, and not as
branchiostegal rays. The ribs were enveloped in the mucous
membrane of the intestine, and each alternate pair bifurcated
below, to enclose the abdominal longitudinal vessel or heart.
 From these circumstances, and from other considerations, the
 author looked upon the ribs of Amphioxus not as true ribs, but as
 splanchno-ribs — repetitions of the hyoid bone — analogues of the
 tracheal and bronchial cartilages of the higher Vertebrata.     The
 tissue of the splanchno-skeleton is more advanced than that of
 the neuro-skeleton ; the ribs are cartilaginous ; the hyoid bones
 hollow cartilages, with isolated cells or nuclei in their interior.
     The nervous system presents nothing more than a spinal cord,
 without a trace of cerebral development, and from CO to 70 pairs
 of spinal nerves. The spinal cord was in the form of a ribbon,
 pointed at both ends, with a dorsal   median groove, and a line of
 black or grey   matter;   was composed of nucleated cells, without

                                 345
tubes or fibres, and gave origin to the nerves in single roots only.
The nerves were all symmetrical, dividing into dorsal and ventral
branches.   The second pair sent back  a dorsal and a  ventral branch,
to  join the corresponding branches of the other nerves, along
the sides of the body, and along the bases of the dorsal and anal
fins ; from which distribution the author was inclined to believe,
that although the second pair in Amphioxus presented certain re
semblances to the vagus, it was, in reality, the trifacial.
   The vascular system consisted of a straight abdominal vessel,
the branchial artery or heart, without any trace of valves or di
vision into cavities.   This vessel sent off lateral branches, which,
passing up on the internal surface of the intestine, along the ribs,
communicated     by a capillary respiratory system   of vessels with a
dorsal trunk or aorta.
    The intestinal tube was straight from mouth to anus, its ante
rior half dilated, strengthened by ribs as described above, and its
entrance guarded by the hyoid rays.      This dilated portion of the
canal received sea-water, as in the Ascidice, to act on the respira
tory vascular ramifications on its internal surface, which is un
doubtedly ciliated in the living animal.     The digestive portion of
the canal is narrow, and presents not a trace of a liver, or of any
other assistant chylo-poietic viscus.
    As there was no trace of branchial fissures — as the ribs were
too numerous to be looked upon as true branchial arches (bran
chial arches alternating with branchial fissures) — and as the other
organic systems were in the condition of those of an embryo before
the appearance of branchial clefts, the author was led to the con
clusion that the Amphioxus had never had, at any period of its
existence, branchial clefts; — that it was an animal which had
arrived at its perfect development before the branchial clefts had
appeared, and, consequently, with an undeveloped osseous and
 nervous system, without a liver, and with an unilocular heart.
    After examining the generative organs, and other departments
of its anatomy, the author entered upon the consideration of the
 zoological position of Amphioxus, which he observed could no
 longer be ranked with Pctromyzon and Myxinc, but must take an
ordinal place in any new arrangement of the class. In conclusion,
 he remarked, that although genera allied to Amphioxus might now
 be rare, yet in the ages which have passed since the development
 of organic forms commenced, Abranchiated fishes may have been
 more common, and may yet afford subjects of research to the
palaeontologist

                            1841-1842.                        No. 19-*

    Sir T. M. BRISBANE, Bart., President, in the Chair.
   The following communications were read : —
1.  On the Circulation of the Blood, and the Difference of the
      Laws of Fluids moving in Living and Dead Tubes. Part
      Second.    By Sir Charles Bell.
   He recommenced with the statement of the difference with which
water flowed from a reservoir through tubes of equal calibre, but
unequal lengths; and of the effect of pressure on elastic tubes, shew
ing that the impediment to the transmission of fluid through them
was proportioned to their length.      He stated that the obstruction
at the turn  of a tube, was proportioned to the acuteness of the
angle. He then inferred that the arteries were in circumstances
to render the delivery of blood unequal, unless there was a living
property additional to the hydraulic laws.
   Then, referring to the effect of capillary attraction, he argued,
that if the law prevailed in the animal body as in dead tubes,
then, on estimating the length   of vessels of capillary size, and the
attraction existing between solid and fluid, the circulation could
not go on.
   He then stated the surprising living qualities in the animal sur-

                                   332*
faces,  of repelling, attracting, selecting; hence inferring, that in
the surface  of the arteries, there did not prevail that attraction
which caused the capillary phenomena in dead tubes.
   Proceeding to illustrate his position by the phenomena exhi
bited by the microscope, and by the occurrences familiar to the
surgeon during operation, he concluded that the inner surface of
the bloodvessels had an influence on the blood contained, of pre
serving it fluid, and of resisting attraction : But that, when the
vitality of their coats was diminished or disturbed, as by the vio
lent tearing of the artery ; then coagulation of the blood, and at
traction of the blood to the sides of the artery, took place, by which
the hremorrage was stopped.
2.  On a Peculiar Structure observed by the Author in the
       Ice of Glaciers.    By Professor Forbes.
   This structure, which appears to have escaped the notice of
authors on the subject, is a veined or ribboned appearance which
pervades the whole ice    of many glaciers. The veins or bands are
occasioned by the alternation of ice more or less compact ; that
which is porous approaching to white or whitish green, the denser
ice having a bluish tint.     The thickness varies from a fraction of
an inch to several inches, and the parallelism may be considered
as complete through considerable       spaces.   It extends in more or
less complete development      from the nivi, or uncompacted glacier,
down to the inferior termination ; and during the greater part of
this space, in the case of the lower glacier of the Aar, the bands
were parallel to the lofty walls by which the glacier was bounded
laterally ; their position was generally vertical, but sloping from
below upwards and outwards as the distance from the sides of the
glacier diminished.     Towards the lower end of the glacier the
structure became very obscure, and for a time nearly vanished.
It appears, however, that these bands or veins change their direc
tion from longitudinal to transverse, their outcropping being pa
rallel to the end of the glacier, the apparent strata there dipping
inwards at an angle of 10° or 20°.        It is this appearance which
has given rise to the mistaken idea of horizontal stratification in
glaciers. The veined structure rises towards the sides or sup
porting walls, and has altogether the appearance of being deter
mined by the contour of the ice, and perhaps by the lines of
greatest pressure in its interior.    In the case of the lower part of
the glacier of the Rhone, the veined structure forms conical sur

                                    333*
faces, widening upwards, and more and more obtuse as we recede
from the centre      of pressure, from which the descending glacier is
spread out   in  all directions ; its extension producing fissures which
extend like radii, and which appear to be always perpendicular to
the direction of the structural planes.
   Without attempting to explain the process by which so peculiar
and interesting a phenomenon is produced, the author remarks,
that its existence and production is highly important in two points
of view: — (1.) As defining in some respects the nature of icy
structure in glaciers, which has been so keenly contested by later
writers, and on which so much of the theory of the progression of
glaciers depends ; and, (2.) As illustrating by analogy the myste
rious geological phenomena of cleavage planes, which have been
attempted to be accounted for by the presence and energy of polar
and crystalline forces, without any evidence having been adduced
how such a structure could result from them.          The structure of a
glacier is daily forming; its analysis falls within the proper do
main of physical inquiry ; and however hopeless direct experi
ments in the laboratory must be on such a subject, the required
evidence may be perhaps attained by the careful study           of glacier
crystallization.

    The following communications         were read   : —
1.   Report of    a Committee on the Papers of David Hume, be
        queathed to the Society by the late Baron Hume. Com
        municated by the Council.
    The Committee to whose examination        the papers bequeathed to
the Royal Society of Edinburgh by the late Baron Hume, has been
intrusted, in the view of suggesting what might be the most proper
and useful plan for their future disposal, consistently with the pecu
liar character and functions of the learned body to which they now
belong, having proceeded to examine their contents with care, have
now to offer, though not without considerable hesitation, the views
that have occurred to them.
    Independently of some valuable and interesting autographs of Mr
David Hume, to be mentioned in the sequel, the important part of
this  bequest,  to which the attention of the Committee has been more
particularly directed, consists of a miscellaneous and very broken
mass of letters, which may, in general, be described as the Private
and Confidential Correspondence of that illustrious philosopher and
historian.     Of these letters, about one hundred and forty-five are
written by   Mr Hume     ; the number of thoso addressed to him is about
five hundred and fifty     ;  making  a total  of nearly  seven  hundred
letters.
    Mr Hume's epistolary correspondents appear to have been very
 numerous, especially in the later periods of his life, when his literary
 fame had been established, and he had become personally known in a

                                      339*
very extensive circle of acquaintance both at home and abroad ; among
whom are to be found many persons of the most distinguished ranks
in society, as well as of the highest eminence in science and learning.
In many instances, indeed, the letters         addressed     to Mr Hume      are
little more than complimentary expressions of homage to an illustri
ous writer, and derive any interest they possess from the evidence
they afford of the extensive diffusion of his fame as a philosopher and
historian.       But the greater and more valuable part of the collection
 consists of the correspondence of those with whom he lived on terms
 of intimate friendship, to whom he was in the habit of communicating
 his thoughts and feelings with a singular degree of openness and play
 ful simplicity, and by whom he appears to have been beloved and ca
 ressed    with a fondness of attachment that affords the most pleasing
 testimony to the truthfulness and amiability of his character in pri
 vate life, and a striking    contrast to the impressions        that may have
 been    received by those to whom        Mr Hume        is known only in his
 metaphysical      and historical  writings.     The letters, in general, are
 not controversial or discursive    ; there are occasionally introduced dis
 cussions    on topics of permanent interest     ;  but even in his correspond
 ence with those to whom his peculiar opinions were the most offen
 sive, there prevails the same mutual kindliness and forbearance with
 which he appears to have inspired his more intimate associates.
      Such being the general character and description of the papers in
 question, it appears to your Committee that the value they possess is
  chiefly to be derived from the illustrations they might furnish of the
  literary history of Mr Hume. Whatever diversity of opinion may
  exist as to the tendency of his philosophical or political speculations,
  it must on all hands be admitted that he has attained, and must con
  tinue to occupy, a station in the literature of his country that cannot
  fail to make the formation of his character and the progress of his
  literary labours   to be regarded as objects      of more than ordinary in
  terest.     In that view, these  papers may be justly esteemed of great
  value.      The series is indeed  very imperfect, and probably its defects
  cannot now be fully supplied from any other sources ; but enough is
  preserved to throw some curious and interesting lights on even the
  earliest period of     Mr Hume's     career  ;   and the materials may here
  be found for tracing     his subsequent progress through          life with the
  most minute accuracy.
      In  what manner these      materials   ought now to be employed, is a
  question which, to your       Committee,    appears to be of considerable
  difficulty.    In the terms of Baron Hume's             bequest, no particular

                                    342*
 valuable letters of Mr Hume,     the originals of which had    not come
 into the possession of his executors, and that a considerable number
 of  these have appeared in various biographical    and periodical publi
 cations.
 2.   On the Optical Properties of Greenockite, by Sir David
        Brewster, in a letter to Lord Greenock.
    Greenockite has the form of a regular six-sided prism, with py
 ramidal summits, the faces of the pyramid being inclined 36° 20'
 to their base.    The pyramids are sometimes truncated on their
 summit.
    The crystallization is often composite.
    The index of refraction of Greenockite is 2.6882, corresponding
 to the middle of the green space, and to the ordinary ray. Hence
 Greenockite exceeds the Diamond in refractive         power, and also
 chromate   of lead, which   I had found to surpass the diamond in
 this respect.
    The double refraction of Greenockite is comparatively small,
 which is not usual in substances of a high refractive power.          It
 is so small, indeed, that owing to its great dispersive power it is
exceedingly difficult to separate the two images.
    The polarising angle of Greenockite is 68° 36' for the mi rays,
which corresponds to an index of refraction for that light of 2.5517.
    I found it very difficult to establish the existence of an uniaxal
system of rays along the axis of the prism ; but I succeeded in
doing this by light of the condensed rays of the sun, by which it
can alone be established ; for when in biaxal crystals one of the
axes is very weak, as in nitre, its influence on the rays is scarcely
visible in crystals of little thickness, such as those we meet with
in Greenockite.
    The uniaxal system of rings is negative, as in calcareous spar.
    The light left at the polarising angle is blue and pink.
    Professor Forbes, after reading the foregoing communication,
remarked that the uniaxal structure of Greenockite was ascer
tained by himself with t he aid of concentrated gas-light, and that
his notice on the subject was published in the Philosophical
Magazine for    July  1840.

3.  On the Results      of the most recent Experiments        on  the
      Conducting Power for Heat of different Soils.         By Pro
      fessor Forbes.
   The author gave, in continuation of a former paper (see Proceed
ings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 3d Dec. 1838), an account
of the continued systematic prosecution and annual reduction of
the observations of temperature at different depths (3, 6, 12, and 24
French feet) below the surface of the ground, in various geologi
cal formations near Edinburgh, viz. the trap rock of the Calton
Hill, the incoherent sand of the Experimental Garden, and the
coal formation sandstone of Craigleith Quarry.       The weekly ob
servations  at  all these stations  have been projected into curves,
which present the most remarkable concordance of general features
for the four years now complete, and give a just confidence in the
comparability of the results obtained. The thermometric read
ings have all been rigorously corrected for the expansion of the
alcohol in the tubes ; and, starting from these data, the results in
the following tables have been obtained, partly by graphical me
thods, partly by calculation.     The quantity marked A is the log.
range at the surface.     The quantity B (which is the most inter
esting result) marks the rate of diminution of the range as we
descend, and is proportional to the square root of the specific heat
of the soil divided by its conducting power. M. Regnault of Paris
has kindly undertaken     to determine the specific heats by direct
experiment, whence the conductivity will become known ; and the
comparison of the results for four years proves that we have al
ready obtained a near approximation to its value, which is well
defined for the different formations, but especially for the Sand
stone, when contrasted with the other two. The results of Tables
III. IV. and V. are deduced from the numbers in Table I. ; and
for the sake of comparability with the foreign observations, the
French foot and centigrade degree have been employed as units.
So well do the observations of the different thermometers for any
one station accord together, that, taking any two of the ther
mometers and combining their results by pairs, we should obtain
nearly the same conclusions. These conclusions are also in ac
cordance with those which the Epochs in Table II., and the rate
of Progress of Heat downwards in Table VI., present ; the best
conducting soil (that for which B has the smallest numerical
value) transmitting the heat fastest.

 1.  On the Cultivation of the Sugar-Cane in Spain.               By Dr
        Traill.
    He prefaced it by a short sketch of the knowledge which the
 ancients had of this plant, of its introduction into Europe, and
 from thence into the American Islands.             He endeavoured to
 shew, from Spanish        authorities, that very soon after the disco
 very of America, the Spaniards carried the sugar-cane, among
 other useful plants, with them to the West Indies, and sedulously

                                 347*
cultivated   it; and he considered  the speculations of Labat and
Lafitau, on the supposed     American   origin of the, cane, as very
inconclusive.
    The author's remarks on the Spanish cultivation of the cane
were the results of his personal observations during a residence
of some months in Spain in the year 1814, and of some statistical
information afforded to him by the late Wra. Kirkpatrick, Esq. of
Malaga.      The sugar-cane culture was introduced by the Moors,
soon after their conquest of Spain, and flourished exceedingly
even after the overthrow of their empire in the Peninsula.       Its
first serious check was from the cruel and impolitic expulsion of
the Moriscoes in 1609 ; its second, from the enormous extension
of sugar plantations in the West Indies and South America. Yet,
notwithstanding the capricious oppressions of a tyrannical go
vernment, it has subsisted to the present time as a considerable
branch of Spanish agriculture, with periodic fluctuations in its
prosperity, for two hundred years since the expulsion of the most
industrious inhabitants of Spain.
    He described the district producing sugar, at the period of his
visit, as extending along the shores of the Mediterranean, from
Adra to Manilla, a distance of 130 miles. The breadth of this
track, however, is small — not more, on an average, than four or
five miles, being hemmed in on the west and north by the rugged
mountains of Andalusia.       These ranges screen it from the west
and north winds ; but as the most lofty are crowned with peren
nial snow, occasional frosts are injurious to the sugar planter.
 The general climate of Andalusia was shewn by Dr T. to be re
markably mild throughout the year ; as is proved by the luxuriant
growth of Chamasrops humilis, Cactus Opuntia, Agave Americana,
the orange and the lemon, and the date-palm, in Southern Anda
 lusia.
    Along the track in question there are many sugar plantations,
and a considerable number of sugar-mills, moved either by water
or by mules.     Most of the plantations are small; but one estate
made 4600 loaves of white sugar annually, each of the value of ten
dollars.    Most of the Spanish sugar, however, was either Musco
vado or clayed sugar.      The statistical remarks shewed that a
well-managed estate, near Marbella, returned in the worst years
7 per cent, on the    capital employed, in middling    years  11 per
cent., and in good years from 16 to 20 per cent., after deducting
all charges.

  2.  On the Theory of the Parallel Roads in the Glens of Loch-
        aber.   By Sir G. S. Mackenzie, Bart.
     Sir George Mackenzie read a paper on the Theory of the Pa
  rallel Shelves in the Glens of Lochaber, in which he first noticed
 the objections to the theories that ascribed the origin of these ap
 pearances    to fresh-water lakes, the barriers of which had been
 destroyed at different    periods ;  and to the ordinary action   of the
 sea when the land was at a lower level than at present.             The
 causes supposed to have removed the barriers,         in the first case,
 being violent disruptions, the preservation of level and parallelism
 is totally inconsistent with such operations.      In  the second case,
 the shelves being confined     to the single locality   of these glens,
 while, supposing them to have been sea-beaches, the appearances
 of such shelves should be frequent and to be seen every where; it
 becomes necessary that the elevation of the land should have been
 confined to a narrow locality, and to have exhibited a boundary
 no where to be found. In this case, also, the elevation of the land
 must have been sudden, otherwise the traces of the action of the
 sea would have been seen continuous all over the sides of the glens.
 Sudden elevation being therefore necessary, it is not at all pro
bable that the levels and parallelism could have been preserved
 so  perfectly as to be in accordance with the curvature of the earth.
     Sir George alluded to the researches of Sir James Hall in re
ference to the debacle or flood that appears to have passed over
the country ; and to the notions of Professor Agassiz, that ice, a
universal glacier, had produced the phenomena which had been
attributed to the debacle. He denied that these phenomena could
have been the effects of glaciers properly so called ; though, as
stated by him in a paper read last session, masses of ice may have
been, and most probably were, brought from the       Arctic Regions by
the debacle,    and may have been arrested in the narrow passes
among the     mountains,   forming temporary glaciers, if such an ap
pellation may be applied to them, and producing effects not easily
accounted for without such assistance.        Sir George then pointed
out a singularity in the localities of the Lochaber glens, in refer
ence to the demonstrated course of the debacle, which had led him
to attribute to that catastrophe the formation of the shelves. The
openings of the glens face that course, and they turn towards the
north, so as to become nearly parallel to the Great Glen. The
highest summit level is between Glen Gluoy and Glen Roy, and
the other lower summit levels are between Glen Roy, Glen Spean,

                                    349*
 and the valley of the Spey.       The debacle coming from the NW.
 would fill these glens, and flow over the summit levels.       As soon
 as  it subsided below that of Glen Gluoy, that glen would be in
 the condition of a lake or arm of the sea, and defended from the
 great tumult of waters by the mountain ridge betwixt it and the
 Great Glen, while the agitation would be sufficient quickly to
 produce the highest of the shelves. When the waters subsided be
 low the summit level of Glen Roy, then the highest shelf in that
 glen would begin to be formed.       As the subsidences would be ir
 regular, in consequence of the agitation of the waters, and the in
 fluence of the varied surface of the land, and as also the tides would
 contribute in a considerable degree to this irregularity, Sir George
 conceived a sudden subsidence, and a sudden stoppage for a time,
 amply sufficient for the formation of the imperfect terraces or
 shelves, the sections of which clearly indicate something very dif
 ferent from the comparatively tranquil operations of the sea on
 the coast. The lowest shelf appears to have formed on the subsi
 dence of the water below the summit level betwixt Glen Spean
 and the valley    of the Spey. The shelves disappear at the points
 where the agitation of the waters may be supposed to have been
 too great for their formation, on account of vicinity to the Great
 Glen  ; and, consequently,    we may expect the diluvium to assume
 the appearance     in that locality which it exhibits in many others,
 and modified by the shape of the surface.       This modification is
 beautifully exhibited whenever the effects of the land on the move
 ment of the waters is taken into account, and which it has never
 been sufficiently, when the theory of a debacle has been discussed.
    Sir George admitted fully the probability that masses of ice,
brought by the debacle, may have rested at the openings of these
glens, and acted as barriers to a certain extent ; but this, he consi
dered, does not affect his general theory, while it rather strengthens
it.   The erratic blocks found on the shelves may have been depo
sited by ice ; and if rounded pebbles, brought in evidence by Mr
Darwin against Sir George's theory, could not have been produced
by such a vast torrent, the great abundance of ready-made pebbles
to be found in the masses of conglomerate over which the flood
had to pass, would sufficiently remove the objection.       Sir George
expressed himself as by no means anxious about the fate of his
theory, because a philosophical examination of it, if condemnatory,
would remove obstacles in the way of arriving at truth ; and         if
laudatory, would lead to a correct explanation of facts still in      a
somewhat     anomalous    state.

3.   On the Results obtained with different forms of Rain-
       Gauges. By Joseph Atkinson, Esq.               Communicated by
       David Milne, Esq.
    The objects proposed were —
    First, To discover the difference, which the height of Rain-
 Gauges above the surface makes in the amount of rain received by
each gauge.
    Second, To try the effect     of an Inclined Funnel, which always
presents    itself towards the wind.
    Third, To test the action of a Globular Gauge or Sphere.
   Fourth, To investigate whether any and what difference the
size of the funnel made in the quantity of rain received.
   The number of gauges used to accomplish these objects was
six; — of which three were horizontal funnels, 12 inches in diame
ter, placed    respectively   0, 3, and 6 feet  above the   surface;   one
was a copper sphere, 36 inches in circumference, placed 6 feet
above the surface ; one was a funnel, 12 inches in diameter, placed
at an angle of about 45 degrees, and C feet above the surface — a
vane was attached to the rim of this funnel, and this last moved
upon a pivot over the receiver      ; and the sixth gauge had a funnel
of  18 inches diameter,     placed horizontally, and six feet above the
surface.
   The results obtained from these gauges in twelve months,             be
ginning with November 1840, were as follows : —
   First, The excess of the surface gauge over that which was
three feet above the ground, was nearly identical with the excess
of the latter over that which was six feet above ; the excess in
the first mentioned     case being 1.816 inches   — in the latter,   1.865
inches.
   Second, The inclined and moveable funnel always took more
rain than the horizontal funnel on the same level during strong
 winds, and less during calm winds. The difference between these
two gauges was, in twelve months, only 1.887 inches.              In that
period,   the  horizontal funnel   on the surface had taken  1.804 inches
more rain than the inclined funnel, the latter being placed 6 feet
above the surface.
    Third, The globular gauge, instead of receiving more rain than
the common horizontal funnel at the same level, as might have
been expected, received 0.560 inches less in the twelve months.
 In the first six months, it received more rain than the horizontal
funnel, but during the warm months it received considerably less.
 During the cool months it represented very fairly the mean of the

                                         351*
horizontal funnel and the inclined funnel ; but during the summer
months it failed in doing so, that failure being greatest in August,
when it had taken 0.536 inches less than the mean of the other
two gauges.          In the twelve months the globular gauge had taken
1.503 inches less than the mean of the other two gauges.
    Fourth, The funnel, which had a diameter of 18 inches, re
ceived 2.505 inches less rain than a funnel 12 inches in diameter,
which was placed at the same height. And this difference was
not the effect of one or two months ; for it will be observed, on
reference to the Table, that the quantity received by the larger
funnel was uniformly less than the quantity received by the smaller.
    These results were obtained at Harraby, near Carlisle.

 1.  On the Identity of the Animal Matters which form the
       Basis of the Animal Fluids and Solids. By James Stark,
       M.D., F.R.C. Phys.
    The author, after referring to the late researches of Mulder,
 Vogel, Liebig, &c., whose experiments proved the close analogy
 between albumen, fibrin, and casein, and their almost identity in
 composition, stated that, in consequence of some experiments he had
 performed a few years ago, he was led to entertain the idea that all
the animal fluids and solids consist of modifications of one and the
same prototype animal matter.       The following considerations seemed
to confirm this opinion.
    1. Experiments    on the blood, and the fact   of all tissues of the
body, however differing in appearance and chemical properties,
being formed from that albuminous fluid.       2. The formation of the
chick in ovo, albumen and oil being the only matters from which all
the tissues and fluids are derived ; whilst the chick being shut up
in a calcareous covering and tough membrane, which becomes denser
as incubation  advances,   would appear to prevent any of the usual

                                      354
supposed    changes    being produced, which could allow albumen to be
converted into gelatin.        3.   The continuity of tendon and muscle.
The author stated, that if a fine fibre of tendon be carefully
removed, it brings away with it its continuation in the muscle, or
vice versa, and that, when this was examined by means of a power
ful microscope, the continuity of the ultimate fibres appeared to him
to be capable of being traced.         4. The mode in which a ruptured
tendon is repaired, — the fibrinous matter which is thrown out, appa
 rently by simple condensation, seeming to assume all the characters
 of true tendon.      5. The early food of the young of all the Mammalia,
 consisting,   like that of the chick in ovo, of a kind of albuminous
 matter and oil, viz. milk.       6. Experiments on the nutrition of ani
 mals, which shew,       that though fed with gelatin, fibrin, and albu
 men, the lacteals contain a simply albuminous fluid. 7- The similar
 efFects produced by maceration on       all the tissues of the body.
      The author then briefly narrated the chemical details, which satis
 fied him that all the solids and fluids     of the body (fatty and nervous
  matters excepted); might be reduced to a prototype or basic animal
 matter, which exhibited none of the characters naturally belonging
 to any   of the fluids of the    body ; and he shewed     how the albumen
  in the serum of the blood seemed to be instantly resolved         into this
  basic animal matter by a few drops of solution of caustic potash.
  He also found that the potash solution had a similar action on all
  the constituents of the blood, the fibrine as well as the albuminous
  matters not only preventing the blood from clotting but also from
  depositing its red or coloured particles.      The author pointed out the
  effect of ether in removing this basic animal matter in a state of
  purity from its chemical solutions, and remarked that it acted simi
  larly on solutions of albumen and of gelatin.         He also stated, that
   this prototype animal matter appeared, in certain states of the sys
   tem, to bo seoreted in its basic form along with the urine, and had
   been formerly described by him under the name of Gravidine.
      The author therefore proposed to adopt from Mulder, for this
   basic animal matter, the name of Protein, as expressing the Proteus
   like forms it is capable of assuming.
       The author next proceeded to observe, that being desirous of
   ascertaining   what effect   chemical agents exerted on the tissues
   of the body     in  producing their solution, he was induced to ex
   amine the solutions by means of a powerful microscope, with a
   magnifying power of 800 diameters.           He then observed that these

                                       355
were   composed    of   an infinite  number    of minute globular particles
floating in the clear fluid. These globulus were many times smaller
than the globules of the blood, and from their very minute size the
author was only able to guess at their diameter.          These globules, in
the author's opinion, are not to be confounded with those described
by Edwards,      Baer,    Sir E. Home, and others, who also stated the
tissues to be composed of globular parts ; because the globules of these
observers were of the same size as the blood corpuscles.                 These
minute globules the author regarded as the ultimate particles of
animal organization ; and though they seemed to consist of an exter
nal coat, and an enclosed transparent fluid, he thinks this is a
deceptive appearance, and that it is more likely the particles are
solid, as they apparently remain unchanged in size or form on dry
ing.    When the animal matters were removed from their chemical
solutions in a state of purity by means of ether, and again examined,
the author stated that these minute globular particles were even
more distinctly    seen    than before, and that they retained their ori
ginal   globular    appearance and general       character   apparently    un
changed.     He   also stated that the blood to which     -
                                                            potash had been
added, was wholly reduced        to its component globular     particles float
ing either singly or in small irregular agglomerations ; but not a
singlo blood corpuscle was visible ; all had been apparently resolved
into thin constituent globular particles.
    The author then stated, that he was induced to extend his exami
nations to the natural solids and fluids of the body, in order to ascer
tain whether any similar globular appearance could be detected in
them.     On a careful examination, almost all the tissues seemed to
him to be composed of filaments of extreme tenuity, of the very same
diameter as the minute globules ho had previously observed in the
chemical solutions     ;  and these    filaments could, in many instances,
be seen   to be formed       of globules or molecules arranged in lines.
When the fibre or membrane was stretched, the globular or mole
cular appearance of the filaments appeared to be destroyed, but,
when relaxed, the peculiar appearance became again distinctly visible.
    On examining the fluids of the animal body, the author remarked
that the fluid fibrin which rises to the top of new-drawn           blood  was
composed    of a  multitude of minute globules of the         same    size and
appearance as those        previously seen in the tissues and in the che
mical solutions.      He further conceives, from his microscopic exami
nations, that the corpuscles of the blood are very compound bodies,

                                    35G
composed    of the same   minute globules arranged ill concentric rings.
The serum of the blood of the lower animals also seemed to him to
 be filled with minute very transparent globules, but those in human
serum were not always so easily detected.          The pus and mucus
corpuscles were also described as consisting of agglomerations of
 similar minute globules.     The casein globules were also described.
    The author stated that his observations had been made with a
very excellent common compound microscope, but that he had veri
fied every observation by means       of crystal lenses of high power,
simple globules of crystal, a garnet lens, with a magnifying power of
 1000 diameters, and a Wollaston's doublet, adapted to the micro
scope.

1.   On the Parasitic Fungi found growing on the Bodies of
        Living Animals. By John Hughes Bennett, M. D. Com
        municated by Dr Graham.          Part 2.
   The author's object was, 1st, To confirm and extend the investi
gations of Gruby concerning the mycodermatous vegetations growing
in the crusts of the cutaneous disease called Porrigo lupinosa ; — 2d,
To describe a plant    he had  himself found growing on the living mem
brane and tubercular matter of Phthisis pulmonalis ; — 3d, To de
scribe the structure of a plant found infesting the skin and gills of

                                    357
the gold-fish ; — and, 4th, To inquire into the pathological state which
furnishes the conditions necessary for the growth of fungi in living
animals.
    1.  In July  last, the author examined the crusts of    Porrigo lupi-
nosa, readily detected    the cylindrical and ramified   appearances   de
scribed by Gruby, and confirmed his account of the development of
the disease.    In some cases, the appearance of the crusts containing
the vegetations was preceded by pustules; but as nothing of the kind
would be observed in other instances, this seems an accidental, not
an essential character    of the disorder.   The crusts appear in seven
or eight days, in the form of minute, yellow, depressed spots, consist
ing of a smooth, cup-shaped capsule.        This capsule, as seen with a
magnifying power      of  300  diameters,  gives off from an amorphous
granular matter numerous jointed tubes, which discharge from their
extremities many round or oval bodies, the sporules or prolific germs
of the plant.      The appearance of the Porrigo-capsule was always
preceded by desquamation of the cuticle.        Hence it is probable that
the sporules insinuate themselves into the crevices, instead of spring
ing up originally below the cuticle, or in its substance, as Gruby sup
poses.     The author was not more successful than Gruby, in commu
 nicating the disease by inoculation ; but nevertheless considers that
 the doctrine of its contagious nature, generally held by medical
 men, is sufficiently proved by other evidence.          He thinks it is
 not confined to the human race only, as he has lately detected pre
cisely the same appearances on the face of a common house-mouse.
    2. While investigating the nature of pulmonary tubercles, the
author    observed a vegetable structure      in the sputa expectorated
during life, as well as in the tubercular matter found in the lungs
after death, in a case of phthisis with pneumothorax. The structure
consisted of jointed tubes branching dichotomously, between           and
 g0'a of a millimetre in diameter, and springing from an amorphous
granular mass. They gave off round or oval corpuscles, which ap
peared to be sporules, arranged in bead-like rows.          These vegeta
tions seemed to have existed during life, both because they were seen
in fresh sputa, and because those seen in the lungs could scarcely
have attained their actual development in the short space of thirty-
six hours, which elapsed between the patient's death and the exami
nation   of the body.    The plants resembled Link's Penicillium glau-
cum.
    3. The gold-fish is known to be subject to a disease, accompanied

                                     358
with the formation of a cottony substance around its gills, and on
other parts of its body.       In a specimen put into his possession by
Mr Goodsir, the author found that the cottony substance presented
under the microscope both a cellular         and a non-cellular    structure.
The former consisted of long tubes divided into elongated cells, at
the proximal end of which there was a transparent vesicle or nucleus
about a 100th of a millimetre in diameter.            Some cells were filled
with a granular matter ; others were empty, as if they had discharged
their contents.       Besides this structure, there were also long fila
ments, about a 600th of a millimetre in diameter,              which sprung
 from the tubes, and seemed to consist of a diaphanous sheath, and a
solid transparent     matter.    This structure,    as in the two previous
 instances, sprung from a finely granular       amorphous mass.
     The author next gave a condensed view of the history of his sub
ject, describing more especially the observations and discoveries of
 Bassi, Audouin, and Johanys relative to the Muscardine, or fungous
 disease, of silk-worms, — those of Hannover and Stilling, on the Con
 ferva which infest reptiles, —those of Ehrenberg, Goodsir, and Coo
 per, on the mycodermatous vegetables of fishes, — those of Owen and
 Deslongchamps, on birds, — and those of Schaenlein, Fuchs, and
 Langenbeck,     Gruby, and others,     on man.     And from all the facts
 hitherto collected on the subject, he inferred, that the vegetations in
 question are not the cause, but the result of disease in animals, —
 that they grow on unorganized matters, apparently albuminous or
 tubercular in nature, which are effused       into the healthy textures, —
 that they    occur only in animals      previously   weakened by circum
 stances  inducing imperfect nutrition, — and that their growth       is to be
 counteracted    partly   by invigorating   the   body and partly    by local
 applications hostile to vegetable life.
     The paper was accompanied with drawings             of the appearances
 described.
     2. On the Action of Water on Lead.               By Dr Christison.
     The author, after briefly stating the results of his Experimental
  Inquiries, published    on  this subject in 1829,    proceeded  to describe
  two instances which had recently come under his notice, illustrative
  of the solvent action of certain terrestrial waters on lead, and of the
  danger of using this metal for conducting water in pipes, unless with
 a due regard to the circumstances which promote or prevent its cor
  roding property.      In one instance, the water of a spring, conveyed

                                              359
  in  a   lead-pipe from      a  distance of three quartors of a mile, was found
  to act    so  powerfully on the lead, that in a short time the cistern in
  which the water was collected became covered with loose carbonate of
  lead, and the metal could easily be detected             in the   state of oxide dis
  solved in the water.           In this   case,  the action was found to depend
  on the spring         being of extraordinary       purity,  its -total saline ingre
 dients being only a 22,000th part.                  In the other instance, water
 conveyed        half  a mile   in a  lead-pipe,  was  impregnated exactly in the
 same way, and with the very same phenomena,— but with the addi
 tional circumstance,           that, in consequence      of the impregnation       not
 having been detected in time, as in the previous case,                    the disease,
 Colica pictonum, broke out in the house supplied with the water. In
 this case, the water was by no means pure, as it was found to con
 tain no less than a 4,500th part of saline matter.                     But there was
 scarcely any other salt present except muriates, which the author
 had ascertained         in his former researches not to prevent the action
 of water on        lead, unless present in much larger quantity.
     He next       proceeded     to explain in what manner the action of the
 water was put an end to in both these cases.                   In similar instances,
 the only remedy formerly thought of was the                    substitution  of iron-
 pipes.        In the former      of the two   cases which     fell under his notice,
 the water was left at rest in the pipe for four months, till a firm
 crust of mixed carbonate and sulphate of lead had crystallized on the
 lead   ;   after which no farther action took place.               In the latter in
 stance, the same end was attained by keeping the pipe full of a solu
 tion of phosphate        of soda, consisting of a 27,000th of the salt.
     The author appended an analysis of the compound formed by the
 action      of distilled    water      on  lead.    Guyton-Morveau        and others
 considered it a hydrated oxide ; the author himself, in 1829, thought
it a neutral carbonate; and, in 1834, Captain Yorke first considered
it   a hydrated        oxide, and eventually        concluded from his analyses,
that it is an irregular mixture of hydrated oxide and carbonate of
lead.       The author finds that the product is a hydrated oxide, when
the action goes on without the access of carbonic acid; but that,
when the action proceeds in the usual way, under exposure to the
atmosphere, the product is a crystalline body, of which the primi
tive form seems to be the regular octahedre, and which is composed
of two equivalents of neutral carbonate, united with one equivalent
of hydrated oxide (2 PbO CO» + PbO Aq).
    He then stated the following to be the general conclusions                   to be

                                  3t;o
drawn in a practical point of view, from his present and previous
inquiries as to the use of lead for conveying water : —
    1. Lead-pipes ought not to be used for the purpose of conveying
-water, at least where the distance is considerable, without a careful
chemical examination of the water to be transmitted,
   2. The risk of a dangerous impregnation with lead is greatest in
the instance of the purest waters.
    3-  Water, which tarnishes polished lead, when left at rest      upon
it in  a glass vessel  for a few hours, cannot be safely transmitted
through lead-pipes without certain precautions.
   4. Water, which contains less than about an 8000th of salts in
solution,  cannot be safely conducted     in lead-pipes, without   certain
precautions.
   6. Even this proportion will prove insufficient to prevent corro
sion, unless a considerable part of the saline matter consist of carbo
nates and sulphates, especially the former.
   6. So large a proportion as a 4000th, probably even a consider
ably larger proportion, will be insufficient, if the salts in solution be
in a great measure muriates,
   7. In all cases, even though the composition of the water seems
 '
to bring it within the conditions of safety now stated, an attentive
examination should be made of the water, after it has been running
for a few days through the pipes.       For it is not improbable, that
other circumstances, besides those hitherto ascertained, may modify
the preventive influence   of the neutral  salts.
   8. When the water is judged to be of a kind which is likely to
attack lead-pipes, or when it actually flows through them impreg
nated with lead, a remedy may be found, either in leaving the pipes
full of the water, and at rest for three or four months, or by substi
tuting for the water a weak solution of phosphate of soda, in the
proportion of about a 25,000th part.

1.   On the Necessity of the Sense of Muscular Action to the
      full Exercise of the Organs of the Senses.                    By Sir
       Charles Bell, K.H.
    Referring  to the nerves   of touch,  as distributed to the points of the
fingers, the author proceeded to shew that something more was ne
cessary than the exposure of the nerve.           For example, the tongue
being the most perfect organ of touch, resulting from the fine supply
of nerves, is yet incapable of receiving certain impressions ; — so that
although it could distinguish the finest hair, so fine as not to be
felt by the finger,   yet if  applied to the artery at the wrist, it con
veys no sense   of pulsation.
    Part, therefore, of the organization of the finger consists of a
ball of elastic matter, under the nerves, peculiarly suited for receiv
ing pulsation ; and being moulded by pressure, by this means con
veying the sensation of form.        It could not be that the variety in
sensation results from the depth to which the impression is con
veyed, for the nerves of sensation are on the surface, and the deeper
parts do not feel.      It must then be the change or moulding of
the elastic cushion, consequent on pressure, that is conveyed to the
nerve.
    After shewing that weight so little different as that of a sovereign
and a shilling could be distinguished when placed on the tip of the
finger (although no distinction could be made when the pieces of money
are laid upon any other part of the surface of the body, however de
licate the sensation), he went on to shew the happy combination of
the muscular action of the hand and fingers with these palpi.
    Referring to the sense of muscular action, he gave reasons for the
opinion that we had a consciousness        of it independent of the sense
of touch, or of any of the other senses.          He illustrated this by the

                                     362
                                                                         -
 effect of a species of paralysis, in which the sense of muscular motion
  was lest, whilst the power of action remained.
     Referring to the experiments of Weber and others, by pricking the
 skin, he stated, that on pricking certain parts of the body with two
 sharp points at the same moment, there was a sensation of one point
 only, whilst, on other parts, the sensation of the two points was dis
 tinct. Those experimenters drew the conclusion that this capacity of
 distinguishing the two points resulted from the greater concourse of
 nervous filaments.     He stated, on the contrary, that the capacity
 of distinguishing the two points, or, in fact, of distinguishing          the
 form of bodies, did not result from the mere sensibility      of the part    ;
for example, that the back of the hand was painfully pricked,             and
 yet was not capable of distinguishing       the two points from the     one.
 He contended, on the contrary, that the capacity resulted from the
junction of sensibility and motion.        It was limited to the hand, the
 tongue, and the lip.
     Pricking the cheek with two points      gave no distinct sensation, but
 on approaching     the lower lip the points become distinct.      And not
 only the sensibility to form, but to weight also, results from the
 combination    of muscular    motion.      Hence   the sovereign   and    the
 shilling may be distinguished by their weight on being           placed    on
 the lip or tongue, though not by any less moveable part.
     The author proceeded to consider the motions of the eye, arguing,
 that to the full exercise of the organ in vision the action of the
 recti muscles of the eye was necessary, and that a sense of their
 action was combined with the impression on the retina.
     After  some instances drawn     from the musci volitantes,     and the
 experiments    of Dr Wells, he stated, that when the impression was
 permanent on the spot of the retina, the eye being closed, the per
 ception of place was received from the sense of the action of the
 recti muscles.    But  if the ball of  the eye was moved by the point
 of the finger, or by the oblique muscles, there was no apparent
 change in the place of the image.         On this subject, he referred to
 the case of the nystagmus       bulbi,  in  which there was an incessant
 motion of the eyeball, whilst the person saw distinctly,         and could
 perform most minute works with the needle or the pencil.
     The fact on which the author placed the greatest stress was the
 effect of cutting one of the recti muscles.         He referred to a late

                                   303
volume of the     Phil. Trans,    of London, descriptive of a case, in
which a lad, blind from birth, had at eighteen years of age the
sight of one eye restored.     But the eye being distorted towards the
nose, the rectus internus muscle was cut across.       The consequence
of this was, that he no longer saw objects in their right position.
They appeared placed to that side on which the muscle had been cut.
The author's explanation is, that the tendon of the muscle being
cut off from its attachment to the ball of the eye, the muscle con
tracted, and sensibility to this contraction being associated with the
impression on the retina, produced a false perception of the place of
objects.
    The author concluded by expressing his doubt whether his course
of study fitted him to be a competent judge of some of those matters.
He could not resist the conclusion, that these required the exercise
of  a double sense,   and an operation of the mind of the nature of
comparison, to rouse     to consciousness  and the knowledge of exter
 nal existences.

 1.   On the most recent Disturbance of the Crust of the Earth,
       in respect to its suggesting a Hypothesis to account for
       the Origin of Glaciers.       By Sir George Mackenzie, Bart.
    In this paper the author pointed out that the force, which had
 protruded    granite and other matter among the strata, could not
 have been the same in point of time with that which broke up the
 crust of the earth into its present shape ; because the matter in veins
 which we now see exposed to view on the faces of precipices, having
 been fluid at the time of protrusion, must have run out of the fis
 sures on the rock being raised up.      It  appeared, therefore, that all
 matter filling fissures in rocks, had become solid before the most re
 cent cataclysm had taken place.      There being    no appearance of any
 matter having been protruded from below at the time of the surface
 being forced into its present disrupted state, it was assumed that the
 expanding force which broke the crust, was that of vapourable mat
ter, chiefly steam, confined between the solid crust and the igneous
mass in the interior ; and also filling up the place of the enormous
 masses   of matter which had   been, at a former period, forced up from
below, and which we now see in the shape of veins and dykes, and also
of those very extensive ranges of country wholly composed of trap
beds, admitted to have been submarine lavas.         The vapourable mat
ter having increased, and also its expansive force, the crust at length
yielded ; and the vapourable matter being set free, two consequences
were supposed     to have followed.   First, the vapourable matter must
have carried with    it a vast amount of heat, so as to cause a consider
able refrigeration of the broken crust, andtowhich its exposure to atmo
spheric influences, and perhaps also to the rushing of the waters, would
contribute.    Secondly, supposing the cataclysm to have taken place in
the winter    season, the extraordinary quantity of vapour forced by

                                    365
expansive impulse into the atmosphere, would speedily arrive at a'
region whence it would fall back in a frozen state. . This would pro
bably have taken place even in the summer season, at least in so far as
to load the mountain summits and valleys       lifted above the line of per
petual congelation.     A change of climate having been effected by the
disruption of the crust, the winter influences would, for a long time,
have greater power, so that the whole surface          within the sphere of
a  cataclysm might have become covered with ice, until the crust
should begin to recover its temperature from the internal source of
heat, and the influence of the sun conjointly.         The author supposed
that, on account of the surface having had, probably, but little ele
vation previous to the cataclysm, the heat of the crust was so con
siderable, as, joined to the influence of the sun, to be sufficient to
have induced on the temperate zone a climate more nearly allied to
that of the tropics, and such as to have admitted of the residence of
those animals requiring a comparatively warm climate, and whose
remains have given rise to much difficulty in geological speculations.
As a subsidiary source of vapour, the author supposed that at the
moment of the cataclysm, much water would have been admitted to
contact with the interior heated surface.         He was not aware, at the
time he read his paper, that in a recent work            by Charpentier   on
glaciers, this geologist had appealed to the same thing as the only
 source of the vapour ; so that the author's hypothesis of the es
cape of pent up vapour, as the       chief source   for producing glaciers,
still remains his own ; and in conjunction with that of Charpentier,
it seems to furnish a theory of glaciers, which, in the present state of
discussion   respecting glacial action, is a desideratum.
2.   Geological Notes on the Alps of Dauphine.                By Professor
                            Forbes.     Part 2d.
    The district proposed    to be described, in so   far  as it was studied
by the author in two journeys in 1839 and 1841, is an out-Iyer or
appendage to the main Alpine chain, which occupies a considerable
portion    of the old province of Dauphine,       and the modern depart
ments of the Hautcs Alpet and Isire. It         is bounded, roughly, by the-
rivers  Arc and Isere   on the north, and by the Durance and the Drac
in other directions.     Its nucleus is essentially granitic, against which
sedimentary deposits    of  limestone, of different ages, and especially
of lias and chalk, repose in highly elevated or contorted strata; and

                                    306
 it not infrequently happens, that the dislocation of strata      has been
so great, that the gneiss or granite rocks are superimposed upon the
secondary formations.
    The granitic mountains of Oisans, which       are amongst the highest
of the  second order of European     chains, attain a greater elevation at
their culminating point,     the Mont Pelvoux, than any of the Alps
between Mont Blanc and the Mediterranean.               Even Mont Iseran
and Monte Viso arc surpassed in height by this summit, which
measures 13,468 English feet.        The ravines by which the chain is
intersected have a corresponding depth and ruggedness, so that the
cols, or passages from one valley to another, are generally covered
with perpetual ice and snow, and present, besides, more continuous
and inaccessible precipices than are common in any part of Switzer
land.    The author shortly described several journeys made through
the central part of this district, in which it became necessary to
cross cols of above 10,000 feet in height, from whence alone an in
timate knowledge of the structure       of  these   mountains  can  be ob
tained.
    Guided by the interesting memoir of        M. Elie   de Beaumont,   on
the geology   of the Montagues d'Oisans, and by the admirable map
of Bourcet, he was enabled, in a great many particulars, to verify
the observations of the first named distinguished geologist, especially
as refers to the phenomena visible at the contact of the calcareous
and granitic rocks, which left no doubt on the author's mind that
the superposition of the latter to the former is undeniably true.      No
more can it be doubted, that, as        M. E.   de Beaumont affirms, we
have here evidence    of the extensive elevation of previously deposited
sedimentary rocks, probably by the appearance from below of the
granito itself.   Professor Forbes feels some hesitation in admitting,
with M.    de Beaumont, the    crateriform nature of this elevation,    as
indicated by a qud-qua-versal     dip of the stratified rocks round a cen
tral point in the neighbourhood of the Mont Pelvoux, and by the
radiation of the vallies from that centre.         He considers that the
observations of the great French geologist, when analyzed, as well
as his own, rather point to an anti-clinal axis passing through the
point in question, and prolonged in a NN.W. and SS.E. direction ;
accompanied, however, with various minor lines or centres of dislo
cation, especially that which elevated the mountain of Grande Rousse
to the northward,   of which the geology has been ably described by
M.   Dausse^    The interference of this elevation with the previous

                                    367
one (roughly     parallel to the torrent   of the Veneau), probably pro
duced the excessive disturbance of the strata of lias near La Grave,
which have been jostled between        the two granite masses.
    These     views are supported, partly by a consideration of the ex
ternal contour of the group, and partly by direct observations of the
bearing and dip of the strata.

 1. On a New Species of British Grass of the genus Holcus,
        and Observations on some of the more closely allied spe
        cies of Grasses found in the Neighbourhood of Edinburgh.
        By Richard Parnell, M.D., F.R.S.E.
    This grass of the genus Holcus was stated to be> new to the Bri
 tish Flora, since no mention of it is made in the works either of Sir
 James Smyth or Sir William Hooker ; and as the author was unable

                                           368
to find it noticed in the continental             works, he proposed for it the
name of Biaristatus, as illustrative of the species. Several specimens
gathered in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh were exhibited, and the
characters by which it differed from Holcus mollis and Holcus lana
tus were pointed out.
       Specific Characters.   — Both      florets    awned    ;   sheaths of   leaves
smooth   joints slightly hairy.
            ;
                                (See Plate I.)
   Description. — The Holcus biaristatus grows to the height of two
feet or more, but more frequently of about eighteen inches.    The
root is perennial, fibrous, somewhat creeping.    The stem   round,
smooth, and striated, bearing four or five leaves with smooth sheaths ;
the upper sheath crowned with a prominent obtuse ligule.        Joints
five in number, furnished with a few delicate hairs with their points
directed downwards.           Leaves flat, broadish, acute, of a light green
with whitish rough margins, both surfaces soft and slightly rough-
ish to the touch.   Inflorescence mostly simple panicled.    Panicle
erect, the rachis and branches hairy.    Spikelets pendulous, rather
large and few. Calyx of two glumes nearly of equal lengths, mem
branous, acute, hairy at the keels ; lower glume the smaller ; upper
glume with a prominent green rib on each side.        Florets two,
both awned, of two paleae, the outer palea of the lowermost floret
about the same length as the small glume, pedunculated, of a lan
ceolate ovate form, smooth and glossy, with two delicate lines or ribs
on each side   keel slightly hairy towards the upper half, the base
                  ;
furnished with a few slender white hairs ; the upper or inner palea
membranous, about equal in length to the outer palea, and minutely
fringed at the margins.  The upper floret sometimes wanting, but
when present of about the same size and appearance as the one be
low, and elevated on a smooth peduncle about one-third the length
of the floret.        Awn rough, arising from           a   little beneath the apex
of the outer palea, about equal in length            to the palea, mostly straight,
and projecting conspicuously beyond the calyx.
      Holcus biaristatus differs from Holcus mollis and Holcus lanatus in
the following     respects : — In Holcus mollis (see Plate            I.)
                                                              the lower
most floret     isof an ovate form, about half the length of the small
glume, without    long dorsal awn or lateral ribs, whereas in Holcus
                      a
biaristatus the lowermost floret   ovato lanceolate, about equal in
                                           is
length to the small glume, furnished with             a   long dorsal awn, and the
sides with two lines or ribs.
      In Holcus      lanatus (see Plate   II.)   the lowermost floret has no dor
sal    awn, the uppermost floret with            a   short curved, smooth awn,

                                      360
whereas in Holcus biaristatus the lowermost floret has            a long dorsal
awn, and the uppermost floret has a long straight rough awn.
   An unusual variety of Holcus mollis was at the same time exhi
bited, differing only in the spikelets being much smaller and the
panicle more compact (see Plate II.).            Dr Parnell concluded the
paper by making a few remarks on some of the more closely allied
species of grasses.       Fig. 1, spikelet ; fig. 2, florets ; fig. 3, glumes.
2.  On the Ultimate Secreting Structure of Animals.                        By
       John Goodsir, Esq. Communicated by Professor Syme.
    After referring to the labours of those anatomists who had veri
fied Malpighi's doctrine of the follicular nature of gland ducts, the
author alluded to Purkinje's hypothesis of the secreting function of
the nucleated corpuscules of these organs.          In a rapid sketch of the
results of inquiries since the appearance of Miiller's work " De Peni-
tiore Structura Glandularum," and more particularly of the obser
vations of Henle and others on the closed vesicles which are situated
at the extremities of certain ducts,      Mr    Goodsir stated, that no ana
tomist had hitherto " proved that secretion takes place within the
primitive nucleated cell itself, or had pointed out the intimate nature
of the changes which go on in a secreting organ during the perform
ance   of its function."
    Numerous examples were now given of secretions detected in the
cavities of nucleated cells of various glands and secreting surfaces.
Among these secretions were the ink of the Cephalopoda, and the
purple of Janthina and Aplysia, bile in an extensive series of ani
mals, urine in the mollusk, milk, &c.
    The wall is believed by the author to be the part of the cell en
gaged in the process of secretion.        The cavity contains the secreted
substance, and the nucleus is the reproductive organ of the cell.            A
primitive cell engaged in secretion is denominated by the author a
primary secreting cell ; and each cell of this kind is endowed with
its own peculiar property according to the organ in which it is situ
ated.     The discovery of the secreting agency of the primitive cell
does not remove the principal mystery in which the function has al
ways been involved      ;  but the general fact that the primitive cell is
the ultimate secreting structure is of great value in physiology, in
asmuch as it connects secretion with growth as phenomena regulated
by the same laws     ; and explains one of the greatest difficulties in the

                                        370
science,    viz., why a secretion flows from a freo surface only of a se
creting membrane, — the secretion exists only on the free surface en
closed in the ripe cells which constitute that surface.
    The author then      proceeded    to the consideration of the origin, the
development, and the disappearance of the primary secreting cell —
a subject which necessarily involved the description of the various
minute arrangements of glands and other secreting organs.                 After
describing the changes which occur in the testicle of Squalus cornu-
bicus when the organ is in a state of functional activity, and in the
liver of Carcinus mecnas,        it was    stated  that these were selected as
examples of two orders of glands denominated by the author vesicu
lar and follicular.
    The    changes   which occur in the first order consist in the forma
tion and disappearance of closed vesicles or acini.
    Each acinus might be, first, a single cell, denominated by the
author the primary or germinal cell ; or, secondly, of two or more
cells enclosed    in the primary cell, and produced from its nucleus.
    The enclosed cells he denominates the secondary cells of the aci
nus, and in the cavities of these, between their nuclei and cell-walls,
the peculiar secretion of the gland is contained.             The primary cell
with   its  included  group   of  cells,  each   full of secretion, is appended
to the extremity or side of one of the terminal ducts, and consequent
ly  does not communicate with          that duct, a diaphragm formed by a
portion of the primary cell-wall stretching across the pedicle. When
the secretion in the group of included cells is fully elaborated, the
diaphragm dissolves or gives way, the cells burst, and the secretion
flows along the ducts, the acinus disappearing and making room for
a neighbouring acinus, which has in the mean time been advancing
in a similar manner.       The whole parenchyma of glands of this order
is thus, according to these observations, in a constant state of change,
— of development, maturity, and atrophy, — this series of changes
being directly proportional to the profuseness of the secretion.
    In the second order of glands, the follicular, as exemplified in the
liver of Carcinus mcenas, the germinal cell or spot, is situated at the
blind extremity of the follicle,         and the secreting cells, as they ad
vance along the follicle, become distended with their peculiar secre
tion.
     Among other general conclusions deducible from these observa
tions, it appeared that ducts are to be considered as intercellular
passages,    into which the secretions formed by cells are cast.

                                     371
    Finally, the author inferred from the whole inquiry, 1. That se
 cretion is a function of the nucleated cell, and takes place within it ;
and, 2. That growth and secretion are identical — the same process
under different circumstances.

 1.  On the Theoretical Investigation of the Absolute Intensity
           of Interfering Light. By Professor Kelland.
    This Memoir    is the prosecution of a subject on which the author
had   previously  touched  in a paper which is printed in the seventh
volume of the Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society.
It  has for its object the investigation  of the quantity of light which
is received on a screen  of unlimited  dimensions,    after passing through
a certain aperture, or suffering reflexion at two mirrors.         The end
for which the investigation is undertaken is to' ascertain the constant
which must be introduced in using Huygens's principle.            From the
fact, that each vibration at the aperture is multiplied by an area, on
finding the effect on the screen, it is evidently requisite that a divi
sor of two dimensions is required to render the vibration at a point
on the screen,   similarly expressed   with that at the aperture.       Ac
cording to the author's investigation, it appears that the divisor is
the product of the length of a wave, and the perpendicular distance
between the screen and the aperture.         Hence, in reference to such
questions, the enunciation of Huygens's      principle is as follows  : —
    The vibration, at a given point, caused by a given wave, is found
by taking the front of the wave, dividing it into an indefinite num -
ber  of small parts, considering the agitation of each of these parts
as the origin of a wave whose maximum of vibration, on reaching
the point, is equal to the quotient of that at the disturbing point,
divided by the product of the length of the wave, and the perpendi-
cidar from the disturbed point on the front of the wave.

 2. On     the Quarantine-Classification of Substances, with a
        View to the Prevention of Plague. By John Davy,
        M.D., F.R.S., L. & E.
     In this paper, the author, after having noticed theordinary quar
 antine classification of substances, into susceptible, non-susceptible,
 and doubtful, states as the result of his inquiries conducted in Tur
 key and the Mediterranean, that the distinctions involved in this
 arrangement have been made in a very unsatisfactory manner, not
 after careful research and deliberation, but rather during a period of
 panic, and hastily, in comparatively remote and ignorant times, and
 by men, for the then state of knowledge, ill qualified for the task,
 even had they entered upon it with all the calmness and caution
 that the subject required.
     He next enumerates the principal           substances    constituting the
 three different classes,   and   then  comments    on each  of them. His re
 marks tend to shew that the class of so-called non-susceptible articles,
 as glass, wood, metal, pottery, &c., since they have not any power
 of destroying, repelling, or preventing the adhesion of animal matter,
 ought rather to be considered as susceptible of conveying the matter
 of plague, in the same way that they are capable of conveying vac
 cine lymph, i.e., if dried, or in tubes from which air is included;
 on   the contrary,    that the substances     arranged in the class of so-
 called susceptible articles, as    cotton,  wool, fur, feathers, &c., articles
 abounding in atmospheric air, —the great promoter of the decom
 position of putrescible animal matter,
                                              —are least entitled to be held
 fit to preserve and convey the matter of contagion, an inference
 confirmed by what is known relative to the preservation of animal
 matter generally, and especially vaccine lymph, and further con
 firmed by accumulated inference in lazarettos ; according to which it
 would appear that there is no well authenticated instance on record
of plague having been produced within the walls of a lazaretto,
amongst those persons whose duty it is to examine and expose to
the air the so-called susceptible articles imported from the Levant,
and especially cotton and silk.          In commenting on the subject, the
author takes for granted that plague is propagated by a fixed matter
of contagion, according to the commonly received views of the con-
tagionists,   as it is only on this    ground that the quarantine system
itself  can  be supported,     or   any discussion of the question of the
classification   of  substances    be  called for.    He points out, at the

                                          373
    same time,     that, preliminary     to a searching      investigation into the
   qualities of     substances    for the practical purposes of quarantine,
   certain    points   of the  first importance, at present unsettled, ought
   to be    determined in limine, — as whether the plague be truly con
   tagious or merely an epidemic disease           ;  whether it is even endemic,
   independent of contagion ; and whether, if arising from local cir
  cumstances, it is capable of becoming contagious.                    He remarks
  how the quarantine system has been unfortunately established on a
  basis of suppositions rather than on well ascertained facts, and how,
  consequently, it is held by all those who have given it their
  careful attention, to be, as a sanatary system, most unsatisfactory,
  troublesome, expensive, and insecure.              He concludes with tho ex
  pression of the hope that the time is not far distant when a thorough
  inquiry into the subject will be demanded preliminary to a revision
 of the quarantine laws, should the results of that inquiry be that
 plague is a contagious disease, or capable of becoming so.                    In the
 form of an appendix, he relates some particular instances in illustra
 tion of his remarks on the quarantine classification of substances,
 shewing how the distinctions are acted on practically, and how they
 tend to vitiate the present system of quarantine, supposing it to be
 otherwise perfect.
 3. Results       of Experiments on the Specific Heat of Certain
         Rocks. By M. Regnault of Paris. Communicated by the
         Secretary.
      Professor Forbes observed       that, in his communication to the Royal
 Society on the Conductivity of Soils for Heat, on the 20th December
last (see Proceedings, page 343*), he had referred to the separation
of the conductivity and specific heat, which are involved in the re
sults of the- thermometric experiments on subterranean tempera
ture.      In order   to eliminate the effect of specific heat,      M. Regnault
of Paris (well known        by his experiments       on this subject) undertook,
at the request of       M. Elie     de Beaumont,       to ascertain the specific
heats of the soils in which the different             sets of thermometers are

 4.  On the Effect of Snow in apparently increasing the Force
              of Solar Radiation. By Professor Forbes.
    Referring to a communication made by him to the Society on the
 1st February 1841 (see Proceedings, page 322), the author re
 minded the Society that he had then endeavoured to account for cer
tain anomalous facts observed by Dr Richardson, connected with
solar radiation     in the Polar Regions, by adverting to the intense
radiating effect of a covering of snow.          The disappearance of this
snowy covering      in the month   of May, the author had observed to be
synchronous with the anomalous diminution of solar radiation, ascer
tained by a blackened thermometer, in the months of June and              July,
compared with the months of         April and May.
    Professor Forbes endeavoured       to verify his conjecture,     by direct
experiments on the force of the sun amongst the snowy mountains
of Switzerland ; and it was so completely borne out, that the limited
range of his instrument (Leslie's photometer) was in clear weather
always outrun, when it was exposed on a snowy surface ; and even
when placed upon a dark rock (on the moraine of a glacier), the re
flected   light from the neighbouring        snowy summits was      so  intense
as to give extraordinarily     high indications.    Owing to the construc
tion of the instruments,      he was unable to estimate their readings
correctly   ;  but he hopes   to make more accurate observations        during
the    ensuing summer.        Sir John Herschel's actinometer gave a
value   of  the solar radiation nearly independent of its position upon
snow or rock.

      The following communications were read               :
  1.   On the Structure, Formation, and Movement of Glaciers                    ;
        and the probable cause      of their former extension and subse
        quent disappearance.          By James Stark, M.D., F.R.S.E.
     The author    endeavoured    to prove, from   the recorded facts stated
 by different writers,     that the crystalline   particles of which the ice
 of glaciers is composed do not sensibly enlarge after being consoli
 dated into compact ice ; that the crystals have been shewn to be
 fully and perfectly formed in the course of a few nights in the
 Polar Regions ; and that they have a position perpendicular to the
 layer of ice which they form, —thoir length being thus determined
 by the thickness of that layer.
     The author next considered the different         forms of stratification
 met with in glaciers, and stated that the greatest confusion prevailed
on this point, different     forms of stratification   being confounded     to
gether.      He therefore considered glaciers as composed        of—
     1. Horizontal Strata, or layers lying in the position in which
they were first deposited, and only seen in the upper regions of the
mountains.       He stated that these strata were usually regarded as

                                         376
 marking      the additions which       the icy mass had annually received,
 each layer being the accumulated snow of one year ; but that, as
 tho Meteorological Tables kept at the Hospice of the Great St Ber
 nard shewed       that from 300 to 700 inches of snow fell during the
 six winter months, it seemed possible that each layer marked the
 separate storms of snow ; or, if they marked the annual accumula
 tions, they apparently proved, what had not previously been sus
 pected, that snow and ice waste           nearly as rapidly in the upper as
 they do in the lower regions.
     2.  Vertical and Longitudinal Strata. The author stated that
 these   strata wore always of great tenuity, were more or less perpen
 dicular, but had always       a  direction parallel with the retaining wall
 or length of the glacier.        Their mode of formation he attributed to
 the onward movement of the glacier leaving narrow spaces interven
 ing between the sides of the already formed icy mass and the flanks
 of the valley, which, being filled up with the loose and softened
 snow   lying on the sloping flanks, was, from the falling of the tem
perature during the night, and from contact with the already formed
icy mass, converted into a layer of solid ice.              From the thinness of
 these layers, the author      regarded them        as    marking    tho additions
 which had been daily made to the glacier.                The author also stated
 that it would, in all probability, be found that, wherever pillars, pyra
 mids, or needles of ice were met with, this structure would be found
present    ;  as the fissures, which always crossed          the glacier from side
to side, divided it into transverse         sections,    which,   when unequally
supported      below,  would  split  into  smaller    fragments in the planes of
their stratification, so that each fragment would necessarily assume
the form of a vertical prismatic column.
    3.  A    combination   of the   Horizontal with       the  Vertical and Lon
gitudinal Strata.         The author    stated that, as    the mass composed of
the horizontal       strata of the upper regions slowly advanced to the
lower ones, it received, in the manner above stated, a lateral increase,
which, at the same time that it increased its breadth, probably also
added to its depth.        That, as the glacier continued to advance, the
horizontal     strata, which    lay uppermost, would melt away first,           so
that at one point they would only be observed in the middle of the
glacier, and lower down even completely disappear.                  He mentioned
several facts which seemed to prove his position.
    4. Transverse more or less inclined           Strata.      The author stated

                                      377
that this variety of stratification     had not been recognized as a dis
tinct form, but had been confounded with the horizontal             stratifica
tion.    He stated that this form would only be met with when the
original structure of the glacier had been broken up and destroyed
by some obstructing      barrier   or other cause.     He instanced     as tho
most marked example of this the terminal             portion  of  the   Rhone
glacier, after it pours into the valley of the Rhone over its rocky
barrier or precipice.     He described the strata as being formed closo
to the icy mass on which the icy cataract descends, originally paral
lel   to each other, and with a dip of 70° ; but that, as new layers
are formed, and tho first formed layers are pushed forwards, they
lose their parallelism to each other, and assume angles of dip less
and less as they approach         the termination    of the glacier.       This
change of dip and of parallelism the author attributed to the for
ward movement and plasticity of the mass, together with the greater
amount of friction below, where the ends of the layers were in con
tact with the ground, and the constant deprivation of support ante
riorly and below, from the continued melting of the ice at these parts,
which would give the layers a constant tendency to fall forwards.
    The author      then proceeded to shew that fissures or crevices in
glaciers could not be produced in consequence of the unequal expan
sion of the ice itself, nor in consequence of the expansion of the air
contained within its pores ; but that in every case crevices were pro
duced in consequence of the movement of tho glacier over the in
clined plane on which it rested.
    The author next passed to the second division of his subject, the
Movement of Glaciers, and first commented on the Dilatation Theory.
He endeavoured to prove that none of the phenomena observed in
glaciers could be accounted for by that theory.          That a glacier was
not retarded in its movement though riddled with crevices ; that
the supposed dilatation did not alter the form of the walls of these
crevices  ;   that it did not  close them at their upper extremity nor
widen them out below      ; that   it did not give rise to any convexity of
the surface of the glacier ; that the icy mass did not require to touch
the rocky walls of the valley through which it passed ; that it could
move onwards for miles quite unsupported on its margins ; that du
ring a whole summer, whilst its movement             was greatest,   it never
dilated oven the few feet     requisite to  fill up the  spaces  intervening
between     its margin and the rocky walls of the valley ; that it ad
vanced during the heat of the day, and during winter, when it is al

                                        378
  lowed no dilatation can take place ; that it was unlikely water could
  percolate during the course of one day through a solid mass of ice,
  more than 100 feet thick, especially when that ice was colder than
  the freezing point of water    ;   that pools  of water (in the Polar Re
 gions) remained unfrozen for whole weeks during the summer whilst
 their progressive motion was greatest. For these and other reasons,
 the author arrived     at the conclusion    " that glaciers  do not advance
 in consequence of     a process   of dilatation of their icy mass."
      The author next enquired into the proofs of the truth of the
 sliding theory, and stated, that he had satisfied himself that every
 phenomenon known to occur in glaciers could be explained by it.
 He brought forwards, as explanatory circumstances, the descent of
 avalanches;   — the descent of    trees, along the slide of Alpnach ; — the
 fact proved by the meteorological tables kept at the Hospice of the
 Great St Bernard,      when compared with the descent ofHugi's hut on
 the   Aar Glacier, —that    the greater the fall of snow in the upper re
 gions during winter, the greater is the descent of the glaciers during
 the following summer ; — and lastly, the fact that the higher the moun
 tain range (and of course the greater the quantity of ice or snow), the
 lower was the level to which glaciers descend.       He also endeavoured to
 shew that the glaciers, or icy masses, covering the mountains, an!
 filling their vallies, at no part of their course are frozen to the soil on
 which they rest; and that the temperature of the soil covered with
deep masses of snow or ice, was probably never below 32 Fahren
 heit.
     The author made a short digression hero, to account for the pro
 bable cause of the former extension of glaciers, and their subse
quent disappearance.        He endeavoured to shew, that the scattered
boulders, &c. marking the former extension of glaciers, were all
over the surface of the older alluvium (diluvium of Buckland) and
he hence endeavoured       to ascertain at what period that alluvium was
formed.      After   a full examination of the subject, and especially
from the examination of the fossil remains found in that alluvium,
he arrived at the conclusion, that the waters of the deluge were the
cause of the formation         of that alluvium ; and he accounted for
the former extension of glaciers,         by the known effect of water, in
the act   of evaporating, producing      cold,  especially when acted on by
a brisk wind, which was the state of the earth immediately after
the deluge.      The increased moisture in the atmosphere at this
period, he thought, would furnish ample supplies of snow and ice

                                              379
for the purpose, and being first deposited on the elevated peaks,
would rapidly spread over all those extended surfaces which glaciers
are thought once to have covered.    Their subsequent disappearance
he accounted for, by supposing that the icy or snowy covering pre
vented the loss by radiation of the heat received by the earth's crust
from the interior of the earth  since this heat, gradually accumu
                                          ;
lating below, would in time melt the icy masses at their lower ex
tremities faster than they could be supplied from above., and thus
reduce them to        their present dimensions.          He illustrated         this view,
by mentioning the fact, that the angular boulders, &c. are pretty
equally scattered over all the extended surfaces which glaciers are
thought formerly to have covered, but are rarely seen to form the
dykes or moraines seen at the terminations of glaciers at present in
existence ; this fact apparently proving that they must have com
menced     their    decay very shortly after their formation.
   The author stated several other arguments in favour of the truth
of the sliding theory ; from all which he inferred, that the move
ment was not a continuous, but an interrupted process ; — that when
the melting of the sides of the mass detached it from its attachment
to the sides of the valley, and it became undermined below, by the
melting of its base, the force of gravity, unresisted by friction, was
brought     into play,      and it made         a   sudden    progressive movement
(which might be only an inch or several feet), when it remained at
rest, till the same causes produced a renewal of the same result-
He    shewed, that though many parts of these icy masses were nearly
level, all the upper portions, and many of the lower, were lying over
such inclined planes, that gravity could exert                 its full power in their
propulsion      ;   and as the whole icy mass was            tolerably solid and con
tinuous,    the greater       movement of one          portion was     communicated
more or less throughout its whole length, and tended to urge for
wards and downwards those parts which had less tendency to move
onwards of themselves.
     The author      also   endeavoured       to account for the advance          of   one
glacier, and the retirement of another along side of      supposing  it,   by
that  itwas  caused  by the snows being  drifted away from  the one
valley exposed to the blast, and from which the glacier, which was
retiring, descended, and being deposited in deep wreaths in the other,
which was probably more sheltered, and from which descended the
glacier, which was making destructive advances.   The increased ac
cumulation of snow, by furnishing    supply greater than the waste,
                                                a

                                         380
   caused the one glacier to advance, whilst the other retired,         in conse
   quence  of the  waste   at its lower extremity       exceeding the supplies
   from above*
   2.  On Plague, in relation to the question of its Nature, whe
        ther or not a Contagious Disease. By John Davy, M.D.,
         F.R.S.S. L. & E.
      The author, after adverting to the methods of investigating             the
  subject, generally and specially, and expressing preference for the
  latter method ; and, after pointing out how desirable it is in in
  quiries of an obscure nature, to find out instantice crucis, brings for
  ward and details some facts, which he considers as such, on the
  question of the contagion of plague.
      In June 1841, when there was plague in Egypt, but not in Con
  stantinople or its neighbourhood, which had been free from the dis
  ease three entire years, a ship from       Alexandria arrived in the Bos-
  phorus, having plague on board.           Of the crew and passengers, 18
  out of about    96  died during the voyage ; and of the remainder, 9
  out of 16 who were taken into the Lazaretto.               Moreover, certain
  persons of Constantinople, employed in the duties of the Lazaretto,
  contracted the disease, — four altogether, of whom three died.
      As the   disease, with which      they were attacked was the same as
  that   imported,   and as this was       unquestionably    plague,   and was
  isolated in the Lazaretto,     these instances    seem  to be demonstrative,
  that plague can be propagated by contagion, and that therefore (if
  there be, as it is presumed, a certain consistency and constancy in
  diseases) it must be considered a contagious disease,           although, on
  many occasions, owing to obscure interfering causes,            it may not
 spread from person to person, and become epidemic.
      The author, till   he   visited the Levant and became          acquainted
 with these cases, was sceptical as to the contagion of plague ; and in
 consequence, before he allowed them to weigh on his mind as evi
 dence, he examined into them most carefully,           without being able to
 find any circumstance       connected    with  them,   tending even to raise
 suspicion  of  their  accuracy    as examples   of  communicated    disease.
     Among several points of collateral        interest connected with     these
cases, he adverted only to one, viz. the manner in which the disease
may have been communicated,            — thereon expressing his opinion or
conjecture,   that in one of the four, it owed its origin to actual con

                                      381
tact, and in the other three, to touching substances, which had shortly
 before been touched by the plague patients, such as glass, metals, or
earthenware     ; and he assigned the reasons which led him to this con
clusion.
 3.  Analysis of Two New Minerals of the Zeolite Family.
        By Thomas Anderson, M.D.                    Communicated by Dr
        Christison.
    The minerals      in question are the Phakolite of the Bohemian
Mittelgebirge,    and Caporcianite, a newly discovered mineral, first ob
 served by Dr Savi, in a copper-mine at Caporciani, in the valley of
Caecino.     The author found, that in point of composition, Caporcia
 nite belongs to that division of the -zeolites, which comprehend
 Analcine, Ledererite, Potash-harmotome, Chabasie, and Levyn, and
whose constitution        is represented by the mineralogical         formula
r S2+3 AS2      +  2 A q, — z  being a variable quantity, r representing
the variable monatomic bases, and       A   & S alumina and silica.       The
formula for Caporcianite proved to be r Ss + 3 A S' + 3 A q, and the
monatomic base consists chiefly of lime.            Phakolite belongs to that
groupe of zeolites comprising Gigantolite, Harrington ite, Mesotype,
Lehuntite, Mezolite, Scolezite, Pyrargillite, and Antrimolite, whose
composition is represented by the mineralogical formula rSs4          iAS  +
z A q, — the equivalents of alumina and silica being variable, as
well as water ; and the formula for Phakolite is r S*+2 A S + 3 A q,
the monatomic basis being lime, potash, and soda.               The numerical
proportions of the constituents of the two minerals were as fol
lows  : —

4.  Dr Christison      exhibited    specimens from the Government
       Superintendent        of Tea Culture in Assam, illustrating

                                        382
       the several ages at which the leaves of the Assam and
       China Tea-plants are used for making the different com
       mercial varieties of black and green tea.
   An examination of these specimens         seemed to prove, that the leaves
 of the China     tea-plant,   cultivated at the same plantation     with the
tea-plant of Assam, are considerably less, and somewhat thicker, but
otherwise so exactly similar, that the two plants may well bo mere
varieties of the same species, — an opinion now generally adopted by
botanists in India.       The specimens further illustrated the doctrine
deduced from recent investigations in India, that the different kinds
of green and black tea are made from the leaves of one species of
plant, collected at different periods of their development.          The spe
cimens were collected in      April 1841.      The unexpanded      shoots and
very young leaves are marked as yielding Pekoe, a black tea, and
Young Hyson, a green tea, by different modes of preparation. The
fully-expanded,      but still young leaves, are stated to produce Pou-
chong, Souchong, and Campoi, among the black teas, and Imperial,
Gunpowder, and Hyson, among the green teas.                Older and firmer
leaves produce Congo, a black tea, and Twangkay and Hyson -skins,
two of the green teas ; and the oldest and coarsest of the leaves pro
duce Bohea, the lowest in quality of the black teas.

 1.  On the Construction of a New Music Hall. By Sir George
       S. Mackenzie, Bart.
    The author noticed   a variety of facts which were in direct opposi
tion to the common notions entertained on the subject ; and which
le'd to the conclusion, that the chief object to be kept in view, was to
destroy all sound that did not go directly from the source of sound
to the ears of the audience, by preventing reflection.      He described
the plan of the Hall now building at the Assembly Rooms, the form
of which is crucial, owing to the   space on which it stands having been
limited,  and the necessity for connecting it with the pre-existing
apartments ; and he stated that he would have preferred a square,
with the orchestra somewhat retired on one side.      The new Hall was
to be regarded as an experiment ; and if one mode for destroying
superfluous sound did not succeed, others would be tried.

1.    Letter on Terrestrial Magnetism, addressed to the Secre
         tary.     By Professor Hansteen of Christiania.
                                                 Christiania, iJie '22nd April 1842.
    * * * *      I have    the pleasure to  send you two papers : tho first on the
 changes, which the moment of a magnetieal needle or bar undergoes as a
function of the elapsed time, and of tho variations of the temperature ; the
 second, in the German language, is an extract of a letter to Professor Kupffar
 of St Petersburg, exhibiting the changes of the time of 300 horizontal vi
 brations, in Christiania, of my invariable magnetieal cylinder, made by Dol-
 lond in 1819, from 1820 to 1839. In tho Latin Programma, page 17, seven
later observations, to this year, are annexed. In the first paper it is demon
 strated by experiments, with nino different magnetieal cylinders, that the
 moment M is a function of the time t, elapsed after its being magnetized, of
 the following form : —
                                  M=    C +   B^",
  where C =     M„     is the value of M, when t =     os , e the basis of the natural
 logarithms,    q a constant depending     of the quality and hardness of the steel,
  B =   MQ
            —M        is the whole variation of M between t — 0, and I s= to . The
 moment      of every magnetieal needle has accordingly a limit C, which it
 cannot transgress ; and every variable needle may bo used to determine
  the intensity in a voyage, when only the three constants, B, C, q, are de
 termined by three observations, including the whole time of the voyage. In
  page 13, you will find under No. 4, the history of the cylinder belonging to
  the  "  Hansteen    Apparatus" of the Boyal Society of Edinburgh, from No
  vember   5. 1821, to October 29. 1826.     After its arrival at Edinburgh, it seems
  to have lost some more of its power, perhaps from coming into a higher
 temperature. For, according to my calculations, it should already have been

                                              389
 almost invariable after 664 days.          I shall only remark, that to such delicate
 researches as the variation of the moment of a magnetical needle, which is
 nearly constant, a single observation           is not sufficient, as the daily regular
 and irregular variations      may make 2" to 3", upon a time of 800''.
    The variation of the time T of 300 vibrations, page 17, seems to point out
 a variation of the horizontal intensity, either periodical (of Bhort period),
 or undulatory    ; for, as the time T has been without variation,              or even de
 creased from 1820, 71, to 1823, 54, in the first period, where, according to
                                 ~
 the formula M = C + B c ? ' the decrease of M should have been greatest,
 the change of T may have its origin from a variation in the horizontal
 intensity of the terrestrial magnetism. It had a maximum in 1823, a mini
 mum in 1828, or 1829, and another maximum in 1839.                      I have found the
 same difference between         1823  and 1827,      by different    other cylinders,     and
 in different places,    as Copenhagen,      Altona, and Paris ; also, the same dif
 ference between 1832 and 1839 in Gbttingen, with the same cylinder.                        In
 the letter to Mr Kupffer, I sought to express this variation as a function of
 the longitude of the moon's ascending node ; and, accordingly, the period
 should be 18| years : the time to come will decide.
    I  have for four years observed the meteorological               instruments    here in
 Christiania, at five fixed hours, 7 — 9 forenoon, and 2          —4—      10 afternoon ;    in
 the last year are added    0b  and 7h  afternoon.      From these observations       1  have
 calculated the constants      a,, a„         «„   p. in  the formula,
                    0 = n   +  «, sin (a,    +  () + «a   sin (a,  +  2r),
 where 0 is the variable height of the barometer, t the horary angle of the
 sun, n the mean value of & in 24 hours for the whole month.                     These con
 stants are calculated, and curves constructed, for every month in the year.
 By   these constants    I have found,    that here, in Christiania, lat. 59° 54'       4 2". 5,
the barometer has two maxima             and two minima in the nine months              ;  but
 that in the three months, May, June, and           July,  when the sun is not six hours
below the horizon, the nocturnal minimum vanishes, and the morning                         and
 evening maximum coincide in the night.               In the winter months, November,
December, January, when the day is only six hours, the oscillation in the
afternoon is very little, so that it is evident, that, in greater latitudes, near
 the polar circle,    the minimum in the afternoon             will   vanish, and the two
 maxima, morning and evening, will coincide in the afternoon.                    This appa
rent anomaly is, of course, a necessary consequence of the general rule,
modified by the short day. I have in the same manner calculated ten years'
observations in Dresden, by Inspector Lohrmann, six times per day, 0h, S',
6h, 9h, 18h, 21*.      In  Dresden,    the two minima are visible through            all the
twelve    months.       I  have   sent   the   calculations     and the curves       to    Mr
Schumacher,      in Altona, and hope he will publish them in his " Astron.
Nachrichtcn." The whole oscillation, between the greatest maximum and
lowest minimum in Christiania, is greater than that deduced from the obser
vations of Mr Sommer at Konigsberg.              The mean temperature at Christiania
is less than that stated by L. vonBuch, that is, scarce more than 4 j°Eeaumur.
   In 1839 I made a voyage through Denmark and the northern parts of
Germany, and observed the following horizontal intensities, expressed in
absolute unities after the method of Gauss (unities of longitude = 1 millim.,

                                                      390
of weight      1  milligramme, of time = 1 seeoud mean time).                            The observations
are made with my standard cylinder D (De mutationibui momenti, page 16, 17)
and are reduced to absolute quantity by the method, ibid., page 40, by the
constant logarithm, log. A, which, in the calculations, is assumed = 6,00811,
instead of 6,00843.

   Taking the horizontal intensity H, in absoluto unities for Gottingen
=    1.7751, and according to your observations, Gottingen = 0.9783, Dresden
=    1.0007, Edinburgh = 0.838 (Paris = 1.000),                       I find for Edinburgh in ab
solute unities, from the observations                 —
                          In  Gottingen         H=     1.6205,
                          In  Dresden           H=     1.5284.     Mean       1.5244.5,
a  little less than in Christiania.                 When    T  is the corrected time of 100 vibs.
of the Edinburgh cylinder, No.                   1, and  HT° = A,       I find,       supposing in Edin
burgh T = 270"678.
                                            log.  A   = 5.04769.
As the horizontal intensity has so many variations, hourly, daily, monthly,
regular and irregular, and undulatory, or perhaps periodical variations in
18-19 years,        I find the comparison with Paris, especially when it is found
ed upon a single observation, made in different hours of the day, and after
an interval of a month or more, not perfectly sure.t                          I will illustrate       this by
the following corrected observations of 300 vibrations                          of my cylinder D here
in Christiania, in the garden of the Observatory.

   • The 30th July 1834, Hofrath Gauss observed the same cylinder in the same place in
the garden of the Observatory, and found reduced time, T, of 800 vibrations = 759".29,
which gives intensity — 1.7672.
   t [The value of the horizontal intensity at Edinburgh compared with Paris (.840) was
not deduced, as Professor Hansteen supposes, from a single comparison.                        It was repeated
by me in two different years with almost perfect agreement, and confirmed by observations
at Brussels, a station independently compared with Paris.                   Professor Bache of Philadel
phia has since found the same relative intensity for Edinburgh agreeing to the 3d deci
mal place. — J. D. F.]

 tiania, with three different instruments, 1st, A 5-inch instrument
 by Doliotid, divided        to 20', with two needles           ; the one cylindri
 cal, with conical       ends, and in the middle a cube, which is per
 forated in two directions,            so that the axis can be inserted from
 four different sides, and turned round ad libitum ; the other flat
 lancet-formed, in which the axis can be put in from two sides, and                     14
 turned. 2d, A 6-inch instrument by Ertel, in Munich, divided to
 10', with   a flat needle and three axes,            which can    be turned round
 ad libitum.     3d,   An   8-inch instrument          by Gambey, in Paris, with
 three needles and fixed axes.                 By    the instrument     1st  and 2d,
 after every complete          observation, the limb east and west, and
 the needle in the four usual situations, the dip read of four
 times in every position, after having been lifted from the agate
planes (in all thirty-two readings), the axis was turned 90°, and a
second observation           made.       This was continued four times, till
 the axis arrived in its former position.                    In all three instru
ments the needle very often was brought out of equilibrium, by
the application of a little tube, with a screw perpendicular to
its axis, upon the axis of the needle. This is useful, in order to
diminish the influence of the form of the pivots, especially on
needles with fixed axis ; and the influence of magnetical particles in tho
circle ; shortly, to diminish constant errors.                  After this proemium,       I shall
communicate my          observations        and   their  results.

    t is the mean time      of the observations in every group ; n the number of

and from these constants calculated the dip in the 5th column.                               A is the
difference between observation             and formula.            The instrument of Dollond
was too little, but the great number of observations (102 in 5.3 years), and
the great variety of methods which have been employed, I suppose may have
destroyed all constant errors.           Since better instruments were employed, the
quantity of A    is   much   less;   and     I think that all these differences are not
really errors of observation, as it is evident that the dip has its irregular
variations as well as all other magnetic phenomena of the earth.                             The for

  I have   found, that the dip in Paris, observed between 1798 and 1836, may
be represented by the         following formula :—
           t   =   69°   38'.9— [4'.4C5 (t —    1800)       +   0'.023395 ((     —   1800)a,
which gives the minimum i =            66" 5'.8 when            I=      1895.
    That the dip cannot decrease to zero, and, accordingly, should have a mini
mum, is quite probable     ; by these two series of observations, this minimum
is likely to  arrive before  the end of this century, perhaps earlier in northern
than in southern latitudes.
  I  am not quite of your opinion, that the observations with a dipping needle
should be rejected only while it gives a difference of a degree and a half be
tween the different positions.      This difference may bo derived from two dif
                —
ferent causes, the eccentrical position of the centre of gravity, and the devia
tion of the form of the pivots from a true cylinder. In the first case the mean
will approximate very nearly to the true dip, if the moment of the needle
before and after the reversion of the poles is not too different ; and when
the needle is magnetized with the same four magnets, and the same num
ber of strokes, this will scarcely arrive. In the second case, the needle will
give different errors by different dips.   This error can be detected by turning
the  axis  in the  needle in different  observations  in the same place, or by ap
plying an eccentrical weight upon the axis, if it is fixed. When the mo
ment of this weight is varied in the different observations, the needle will
repose upon different points of the pivots in different observations, and
 thereby the error will be diminished, if not quite eliminated.       I think this
 has been the case with yourneedle       A.l, as the difference A.2 — A.l changes
 its sign by diminished dip.

 and the probable error of the mean of the whole series is 0'.851.                                     Though
 the probable error of the three determinations 1839, 823 (14 obs.), 1841, 769
 (7 obs.), 1842, 179 (12 obs.), are only 0'.851, 0'.888, and 0'.806, their devia
 tions from the formula are respectively                      +  2'.52,   +   3M7, and — 1'.03, which,
 I think, may principally be ascribed to irregular variations in the dip.
       I beg your pardon for my profusion in this matter, but my long experience
 with different instruments of this kind has made me somewhat sceptical in
 the way of observing the dip, and                   I am not      content before       I have      varied the
 methods of observation,                and multiplied the observations                  as much as pos
 sible.
       In  observing the intensity by vibrations of a magnctical cylinder, you are
 almost the only observer who has not neglected one or more of the neces
 sary reductions, as that for temperature, rate of the chronometer, force of
 torsion, arc, and to observe the cylinder in the same place before and after

in an undeserved miscredit.

procure    you,  I shall make them with great pleasure. I am, Sir, with the
greatest respect, your obedient and humble Servant,

2.   Notice of the occurrence in Scotland of the Tetrao medius,
        shewing that supposed species to be a hybrid.              By James
        Wilson, Esq.
    There exists in several northern continental countries a peculiar
kind of grouse, called by foreign naturalists Tetrao medius, on ac
count of its exhibiting, as it were, a combination of tho characters
of the wood-grouse or capercailzie on the one hand, and of the
black-cock on the other.          It is never found except in countries in
habited by the two species last named ; and as it presents a union
of their characters, several naturalists have inferred that it is not
itself  a distinct kind,    but a hybrid, resulting from the casual inter
course of the other two.          But most naturalists have maintained that
it is   a distinct    species,  chiefly upon tho principle, that, in the wild
state, birds    of different species do not intermingle sexually with each
other.      Mr Wilson, however, having discovered that, in certain dis
tricts of Scotland into which           Lord  Breadalbanc    has lately intro
duced the capercailzie,        and in which the black-cock previously ex
isted in abundance, this so-called intermediate grouse has also now
made its appearance, he draws the conclusion, that it is not a dis
tinct              but a hybrid or mule.        " It had not been previously
        species,
known in Scotland, at least in our times, — it has not been introduced
by any one from abroad, — and yet here we now find it in the very
districts inhabited by the other two."          Mr Wilson exhibited a speci
men recently killed on the estate of         Dunira,   and shewed its entire
agreement       with   the   foreign   T.  medius,  by comparing it with a
specimen from Norway.
3.   On the Coloration of the Blood.               By the late Daniel Ellis,
        Esq., F.R.S.E.          Communicated by Dr Christison.
       [Note.
               — During     the latter part of his life,  Mr Ellis had   been
          engaged in drawing up a statement of his views with regard
          to the function of respiration in animals generally; and having,
          for some years previous to his death, had it in contemplation

                                     306
         to lay before the   Royal Society an account of that part of his
         researches which relates to the cause of the change of colour
         of the blood in its passage through the lungs, he had pre
         pared and nearly completed the paper on this subject, of which
         the following is a short abstract.      It may be proper to state
         that  no reference   is made  in  the paper to the recent experi
         ments of Magnus, which are now generally held to afford in
         controvertible   proof of the existence of free carbonic acid in
         greater,  and  of  oxygen in less quantity, in venous than in
         arterial blood. These experiments came to bo known in this
         country only a short time before       Mr Ellis's  death, and, had
         he been acquainted with them,       might have tended to modify
         his views.]
   In  the first part of the paper, the author states that he still main
tains the opinion expressed in his published work on respiration,
viz., that the quantity of carbonic acid formed in respiration is ex
actly equal to that of the oxygen consumed        ; and he enters into a de
tailed critical analysis     of the different    experiments recorded by
authors on this subject, placing, however, his chief reliance upon
those of Berthollet, and of Allen and Pepys, in order to justify his
opinion.    He also holds the view that the exhalation of carbonic
acid and consumption of oxygen are not independent processes, but
arc the immediate result of the direct union of carbonic and oxygen
within the air-cells of the lungs, and he expresses doubts as to the
accuracy of the experiments of Edwards, which have by many been
held to establish the opposite view.
   Proceeding upon this basis, the author next examines the effects
of air and other re-agents upon blood out of tho body, and          deduces
the conclusion, that, although oxygen gas appears to have the direct
effect of changing the colour of the blood from dark to bright red,
that change may be induced without the presence of any oxygen gas,
and that within tho living body, it is not necessary to attribute the
change to the agency of that gas.       In proof of this, the author refers
particularly to the experiments of Stevens and of Gregory, and he also
details experiments made by himself, which show that, while a strong
saline fluid has of itself the power of changing the colour of the blood,
weaker saline solutions, or such as contain no more salt than is na
turally dissolved in the serum of the      blood, do not effect any change
unless oxygen gas be also present      ;  and that water, which contains
dissolved in it less than T£B part of its weight          of salt, does  not
brighten blood even in air.

                                         307
   The author forms the conclusion, that we must seek some other
cause of the coloration of the blood than the direct action of oxygen.
That cause he conceives to be of the nature of electricity.             He refers
to various experiments which shew that electricity produces the effect
of reddening the blood, and he explains the development of electri
city in respiration, by supposing that the heat evolved by the com
bination of carbon with oxygen in the lungs, becoming latent, is con
verted into electricity, and there produces its effect on the colouring
matter of the blood.          That effect the author holds to consist in the
decomposition of the saline ingredients of the serum, the consequent
separation of a quantity of free alkali, which, acting on the hemato-
sine, changes its colour from dark to bright red.

 1.  On the Growth of the Salmon.            By Mr Andrew Young, In-
        vershin, Sutherlandshire.     Communicated by JamesWilson,
        Esq.
    Mr Young      has here taken up the subject of the salmon's growth
 where    it was necessarily left off by Mr Shaw.           So far as the
 earliest   or fresh-water   state of the fish is concerned, he entirely
 agrees with the observer just named.         He then states the various
 opinions which prevail regarding the more or less rapid growth of
 smolts and grilse, and shews by tabular lists (the result of frequently
 repeated experiments), that the increase in their dimensions is ex
 traordinary    so soon as they descend  into the salt water.   So far back
 as the months     of April and May 1837,     he marked a number     of  de
 scending smolts, by making a peculiar perforation in the caudal fin,
by means of small nipping irons constructed for the purpose.            He
re-captured a considerable number of them ascending the rivers as
grilse, in the course of the ensuing months of June and July, and
weighing several pounds each, more or less according to the differ
ence   in the length of their sojourn in the sea. Again, in April and
May of 1842, he marked a number of descending smolts, by clipping
off the little adipose fin upon the back. In June and July he caught
several of them returning up the river, and bearing his peculiar
mark, — the adipose fin being absent. Two of these specimens were
exhibited to the Society.      One marked in April, and re-captured on
the 25th of    July, weighed 7 lbs. ; the other, marked in May and re
captured    on the 30th July, weighed 3$ lbs.     As the season advances

                                       399
  grilse increase in size, those being the largest which abide the longest
  in the sea.     They spawn in the rivers after their first ascent, and
  before they have become adult salmon.
      Mr Young     also described various experiments instituted with the
  view   of shewing the transition of grilse into salmon.      He marked
  many small grilse after they had spawned in winter, and were about
  to re-descend into the sea.      He re-captured them in the course of
  the ensuing summer as finely-formed salmon, ranging in weight from
  9 to 14 lbs., the difference still depending on the length of their
  sojourn in the sea.     He has tried these experiments for many sea
  sons, but never twice with the same mark.        A specimen marked as
  a grilse of 4 lbs. in January 1842, and re-captured as a salmon of
  9 lbs. in July, was exhibited to the Society.       It bore a peculiarly
 twisted piece of copper wire in the upper lobe of the caudal fin.
  Those     marked and retaken in 1841 were marked with brass wire
 in the dorsal fin.       With theso and other precautions Mr Young
 avoided the possibility of any mistake as to the lapse of time.     Both
 grilse and salmon return uniformly to their native streams ; at least
 it very rarely happens that a fish bearing a particular mark is found
  except in the river where it was so marked.        Salmon in the perfect
 state as to form and aspect, also increase rapidly in their dimensions
 on again reaching the sea.       A   spawned salmon weighing 12 lbs. was
 marked on the 4th      of March, and was re-captured on its return from
 the sea on the 10th of July, weighing 18 lbs.            Mr Young is of
 opinion that salmon rather diminish than increase in size during
 their sojourn in rivers ; and he illustrates this and other points of his
 subject by numerous experiments and observations.
 2.   On the Geology of Roxburghshire.              Part 2.    By David
            Milne, Esq.
     Mr Milne divided his paper into two parts, the first comprehending
 a description    of the leading geological features of tho district ; the
 second    containing the inferences of a cosmological character, which
 the facts related in the first part seemed to warrant.
     In   describing the geology of Roxburghshire, Mr Milne referred,
Jirst,   to the stratified rocks ; secondly, to the igneous rocks ; and,
 thirdly, to the superficial, or (as they have been sometimes termed) the
diluvial deposits.
     The stratified rocks were stated to consist of the following series,
beginning with the oldest, viz. — greywacke, old red sandstone, and
the coal measures.        As to the long disputed question regarding the

                                       400
  existence of the     new-red-sandstone      formation   in this county,  Mr
 Milne, whilst not wishing       to affirm   absolutely the non-existence of
  any strata whatever belonging to this epoch, referred to the older for
  mation the great mass of the red sandstones abounding in the dis
  trict, adding that he had himself        seen  none which necessarily be
  longed to a later epoch.
     It was stated that no fossils had been found in the grey wacke strata,
  but that in the old red sandstone formation, scales and bones of the
  Holoptichius had been found      embedded     both in the red and the white
 coloured strata.
      Tho igneous rocks consist of all the varieties of felspars, basalts
 and greenstones, known in other parts of Scotland, the first men
 tioned of these being the oldest. All these rocks occur in the form
 of dykes, as well as hills, of which the Eildons and Cheviots are the
 highest and most extensive.
     The superficial deposits consist, beginning with the oldest, of the
 boulder clay, well known in the Lothians, — of sand and gravels, —and
 of great blocks or rounded fragments of rocks, all strewed over the sur
 face.    It was mentioned, that, whilst the boulder clay was deposited
 in tumultuous waters (presenting no signs of stratification), the sands
 and gravels being for the most part stratified, have been deposited by
 waters not in violent action.        The greater number of boulders in
 Liddesdale     consist of grey granite, very similar to that of Criffel,
 situated between thirty and forty miles to the westward.
     In part 2d, the author observed, that the greywacke formation,
 presenting as they do enormous foldings, in consequence of which tho
 formation    is traversed by ridges and valleys, all running east and
west by compass, must have been acted on here, as throughout tho
 rest of this part of the island, by a force or system of forces, which
 acted in a particular   direction ; and that as hardly any igneous rocks
whatever     occur,  within the limits of this formation, it seemed that
the greywacke strata had not been elevated and folded together by
igneous action, but more probably in consequence of changes in the
form of the Earth's nucleus, as suggested by Elie de Beaumont.
     The elevation of the greywacke ranges       was followed by eruptions of
f'elspathic and a few greenstone rocks, which took place chiefly on the
outskirts of that formation ; and from the sediment afforded by the
wearing down of these rocks, still at the bottom of a sea, the stratified
rocks surrounding and partly covering these older rocks were formed.
As the heaviest sediment would be deposited first, the sandstones
filled with oxide of iron, and now constituting the principal beds of
the old red sandstone formation, would girdle the hills of greywacke
and older felspathic rocks, whilst the strata of white sandstone, shales,

                                     401
and limestones, being composed of lighter sediment, would be carried
farther, and become members of the coal measures situated in Liddes-
dale, Northumberland, and Berwickshire.
   The formation of the whinstone dykes, one of which was described
as running in a NW. direction, for about twenty-four           miles, was
ascribed by the author to the irruption of igneous matter into fissures
previously formed in the earth's crust.
   The beds of gravel and sand, as well as the boulders, the author
thought might all be explained on the supposition, that the district
had been covered by the waters of the ocean, when they were depo
sited. He adduced facts and arguments for the purpose of shewing
that certainly none of these deposits could havo been formed by gla
cial action, and that probably submarine currents, or great waves, such
as are known to have been produced by submarine eruptions, would
be sufficient to account for  all the phenomena.
3. On the Property of Transmitting Light, possessed                    by
       Charcoal and Plumbago, in fine plates and particles.            By
       John Davy, M.D., &c.
   The charcoal of the pith of the elder consists of plates of extra
ordinary thinness.     It was in examining this charcoal, that the
author first observed   the property which is the subject of his paper.
He detected it by means of the microscope, using a high magnifying
power.     By analogy, he kwas led to infer that the power of transmit
ting light must belong to charcoal in general, in all its varieties, when
reduced to the state of fine powder or filaments, — an influence which
he found confirmed by experiment in a number of different instances,
as the charcoal of the pith of the sycamore, of tho pith of the rush,
the fibre of cotton, flax, &c.     He also found it to belong to lamp
black, to cork in very fine powder, to anthracite, and plumbago.
   The light transmitted he found to vary in its hues, from almost
white, as in the instance of tho thinnest plates of the charcoal of tho
pith of the elder, to brown and red of various shades, in the instances
of lamp-black, anthracite, and plumbago.
   He considers the property of translucency belonging to charcoal
and plumbago, in their finely divided state, as favourable to the
opinion now commonly received, that these substances and diamond
owe their marked peculiarities not to difference of chemical mixture,
but of mechanical structure.       Incidentally, he  notices the specific
gravities of these substances,   — stating, as the result of his own ex
periments, that tho specific gravity of charcoal, cork, and anthracite,
is about 1.5; and that of plumbago about the same, making allow

                                     402
anco for the ferruginous     and earthy matter with which the carbon in
this mineral is mixed.
    In conclusion, he offers the conjecture, that the coloured tints of
vapour and fluids in which carbon is suspended, may be connected
with the translucency of this substance, and that other bodies, hither
to considered opaque, may be found capable of transmitting light,
when examined in a manner similar to that which he has employed.

    This subject is treated under eight different heads : — 1. On the
law of visible direction in Monocular vision.       2. On the law of vi

 account of a survey which he executed of the whole extent of the
 principal glacier of Mont Blanc and its tributaries.         A base line of
 nearly   3000    foet was   carefully measured in the valley, and extended
 by means of a very careful triangulation to a point on the glacier
 distant 28,600 feet, and elevated 4400 above the base line.           From
 the several points of this triangulation, the positions and heights of
 the adjoining mountains were taken and laid down on a map on a

 1. On     the   Anatomy of the Human Placenta. By John
       Goodsir, Esq., Conservator of the Museum of the Royal
       College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.
    In the first section of the paper, the author described the parts
which enter into the structure of tho villi of the placenta.               Tho
villi aro  covered   by a membrane with which anatomists are already
familiar. Within this membrane, and attached to its internal surface,
is a layer of cells, which has also been observed, and described as
epithelium.      The cells composing this layer, Mr Goodsir denomi
nated the external cells of the villus.         The next structure is a mem
brane not hitherto      described, and named by tho author the internal
membrane of the villus.           Tho adhesion of this membrane to the
external cells is so slight, that it is generally seen at some distanco
from them, even in villi which have undergone no violence.               With
in the internal membrane of the villus, a set of very transparent
cells, hitherto   undescribed, is situated.        These the author denomi
nated the internal cells of the villus.           Tho ultimate loops of the
umbilical capillaries     are imbedded in this mass of cells, the cells and
vessels being closely bound up by the       internal membrane of the villus.
    The   second section of the paper was        devoted to the description of
the foetal portion of the organ.         Mr Goodsir described the develop
ment and structure of the tufts of the chorion.            He stated that the
development consists in tho addition of colls to the extremity of each
villus of the tuft, these being supplied by a germinating mass, which
resembles the spongiole of the root-fibre of a plant.         These tufts and
villi are entiroly cellular, and are covered by a fino membrane.
Before tho villi become vascular, the ovum derives nourishment from
the decidua, by the absorbing agency of the cells of the spongioles at
the extremities of the villi of its chorion.          When bloodvessels have
formed in the    villi, the cells, although  less numerous,  still remain, and
are believed by    Mr    Goodsir to be the active absorbing agents in the
villi of the placenta. In the perfect placenta, the villi of the chorion
appear as tho internal membrane, and tho internal cells described in
the first part of tho paper.        These, along with the umbilical vessels,
constitute the foetal portion of the placenta.

                                       408
    In    the third section of the paper, in which   Mr   Goodsir treated of
the maternal portion        of the organ, he corroborated the statements of
of Professors -Weber and Sharpey          as to the nature and structure of
the decidua      ; and he more particularly described an intei follicular
tissue, consisting of cells, which conduces, he thinks, as much as the
enlargement of the glands, to the thickening of the mucous mem
brane. Since the discovery made by Professors Weber and Sharpey,
too    little attention, he believed, has  been directed to the secretions of
the thickened mucous membrane.              This secretion, which forms the
greater part of the decidua reflexa, is, according to tho author, com
posed entirely of cells, and is the nourishment destined for the em
bryo, being taken up after solution by the absorbent cells of the
villi.      By tracing the cavities of the vessels of the gravid uterus
trom without        inwards, as had formerly been done by Professor
Owen, tho author verified the statements of certain anatomists, that
the vessels pass from the uterus into the decidua, and open on the
internal surface of tho latter by oblique valvular orifices.         Ho like
wise observed,       that the meshes enclosed by the uterine veins become
smaller and more ribbon-shaped near the cavity of the placenta, and
that in that cavity they represent the appearance of hollow threads,
which pass in great numbers from the uterine surface of the organ
on to the extremities and sides of the villi, and also from villus
to villus.       Along the cavities of these threads the cellular mass
 of the decidua becomes continuous with the external cells of the
 villi.
     From these observations, Mr Goodsir concluded that the sac of
the placenta is a network of enlarged decidual vessels, the meshes of
 which have been reduced to hollow threads         ; and, secondly, that not
 only is the external membrane of the villi a part of the mother, be
 ing a portion of the membrane of her vascular system, but that tho
 external cells also are maternal, being decidual cells continuous, along
 the hollow threads, with tho general mass of the decidua.
     Mr     Goodsir stated in conclusion   —
     1.    That the external membrane and the external cells of tho villi
 constitute together the central division of the placental decidua, or
 the principal maternal portion of the organ, tho cells being secreting
 cells destined to separate from the blood of the mother a matter pro
 per for the nourishment of the foetus.
     2. That the villi present, in addition, an internal membrane and
 internal cells,      which together constituted, at an earlier period, the
  villi of the non vascular chorion-; that the internal cells     are absorb

                                     409
 ing cello, like the chyle cells of the intestinal tube, taking up for the
 foetus the matter secreted   by the external cells.
     3.  That the placenta not only performs the function of        a lung,
 but also that of a gastro -intestinal mucous membrane.

 Papers on Glaciers. No. 2, describing the Rate of Motion of
        the Ice of the Mer de Glace, deduced from observation.
        By Professor Forbes.
    The author detailed in this paper the methods of observation by
which he was enabled to ascertain the daily and even hourly motion
of different parts of the glacier.
    The following are some of the principal results : —
    I. In the particular case of the Mer de Glace, the motion of the
higher parts of the glacier are on the whole slower than those of its
lower portion, but the motion of the middle region is slower than
either.
    The following table, the result of observations at a series of ascend
ing stations, will authorize this conclusion.

    II.  Tho Glacier    du Geant moves faster that the Glacier de Lechaud
in the proportion of 7 to 6.
    III.  The centre of tho glaoior moves faster than the sides.            When
two glaciers unite, they act as a single one in this respect, just as
two united rivers would do.
    Tho author measured the velocities at different places in tho
breadth of the glacier, and it was found to increase towards tho centre.
The following are the numerical results, assuming tho motion of tho
ice near the edge as the standard or the unit             of reference.
                    81dc.                                    Centre.

   IV.    The difference of motion of the centre and sides of the gla
cier varies (1) with the soason of the year, and (2) at different parts
of tho length of the glacier.
    1. From the observations made, the author concludes, that " the
variation of velocity diminished as the season advanced              ; and that it
was proportional      to the absolute velocity       of the glacier at the   same
timo."
   2. The variation of the velocity with the breadth of the glacier is
least considerable in tho higher parts of tho glacier, or near its
origin.
    V. The motion of tho glacier generally varies with the              season  of
tho year and the state of the thermometer.
   Perhaps    the most critical         consideration    of any for the various
theories of glacier motion is the influence of external temperature
upon tho velocity.         It is shewn in this paper, by a direct numerical
comparison, and by projected curves, that in nearly every instance
the velocity of the glacier, during any period of days, has a reference
to tho temperaturo of the same period.                If  the thermometer     fell,
the glacier advanced slower, and vice versa.               It is not. however, to
be inferred that at the same external temperature the velocity will
always be tho same       ;   only at any season, tho change will always be
in the same direction, and governed by the thermometer, though not
always tho samo in amount.
   Tho author also deduced from various indirect considerations, that
it is very improbable that the glacier stands still in winter.             On the

                                        411
  contrary, he supposes that though its velocity is less than in summer,
  it still bears a considerable proportion to it.

        Volitantes. By Sir D. Brewster, K.H.
 2.   On the Structure of the Lymphatic Glands.                      By John
        Goodsir, Esq., Conservator of the Museum of the Royal
         College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.
     The author    stated that the different lymphatics,     as thoy enter the
 gland, become deprived of their external tunic, which passes on to
 the surface of the organ, to assist in forming its capsule.               The
 middle tunic also becomes weaker, and presents the appearance
 of fibres arranged in the form of arches, which enclose rounded
 or oval spaces, particularly towards the surface of the gland,
 and at tho angles formed by the anastomosis of one lymphatic
 with another.        Mr Goodsir then observed that it was to the
 changes    which  the  internal tunic of the lymphatics undergoes in the
 interior of the gland, that these organs owe their peculiar structure.
 This tunic, when traced from the afferent or efferent         vessels into the
 gland, is found to become thicker and more opaque, till at length it
 no longer transmits light.       It consists of two parts — a fine external
 membrane, and a granular substance attached to the inner surface of
 that membrane.        The membrane belongs, according to tho author,
 to the class   of germinal membranes, with the germinal spots placed
at regular distances.       This germinal or primitivo membrane of the
internal tunic of tho intra-glandular lymphatics is extremely delicate,
and has germinal spots of an oval form, with compound nuclei.
These spots aro tho sources of tho nucleated particles which come
from the granular substance.         Theso particles aro about the 4000th
to the 5000th of an inch in diameter, and form a considerable propor
tion of the corpuscles, which have been long recognised in the fluid
which may be         squeezed   out  of    lymphatic    glands.    The layer
which these nucleated particles forms on the internal surface of tho
germinal membrane is so thick as almost to fill the cavity of the
lymphatic.       The canal of the     vessel  is irregularly pierced through
tho granular     substance, the surface and particles of which are freely

                                    412
bathed by the chyle or lymph.         This granular layer being continu
ous in both directions with the scale-like epithelium of the extra-
glandular lymphatics, it is therefore merely a developed       form of this
epithelium.
     Mr  Goodsir then stated that the opinion of those anatomists who
hold that the intra-glaudular lymphatics form a net-work, is correct.
In the glands in which the      meshes   of this net-work   are elongated,
the vessels, even after forcible    injoction,  never assume    the cellular
appearance.      In those glands again, or in those parts of glands in
which the meshes are rounded or equilateral, the injection of mer
cury produces     the appearance of globular cells.    In other lymphatic
glands, a process of absorption, similar to that which occurs in the
maternal vascular system of the human placenta, reduces the meshes
of the lymphatic net -work     to mere threads or bars, and converts one
or more short lymphatic branches into one multilocular cavity.           All
these varieties are modifications of the simple net- work.
     The ultimate capillaries of the blood-vessels form very fine net
 works on the external surface of the germinal membrane of the intra-
glandular lymphatics.      The anatomical relations of this capillary net
 work, and the germinal membrane and granular substanco of these
 lymphatics, are identical with those of the vessels, membrane and
 secreting epithelia of true glands.
     One of the functions of the granular substance, the author stated
 to bo the secretion   of chyle and lymph corpuscles    ;  but, as these aro
 also formed in other parts of the lymphatic system, he reserved his
 observations on this part of the subject for a future occasion.         He
 concluded by observing, that the structure he had described afforded,
  in his opinion, satisfactory evidence, 1st, That the lymphatic glands
  are merely net-works      of lymphatic    vessels, deprived   of all their
 tunics but the internal, the epithelium of which is highly developed
 for the performance of particular functions ; and, 2d, That these
  peculiar lymphatics have a fine net-work of capillary blood-vessels in
  close contiguity with their external surfaces, for the purpose of af
  fording matter for the continued renovation of the epithelium.
  3.  On the Determination        of Heights by the Temperature of
         Boiling Water.       By Professor Forbes.
      The investigations in this paper were made in order to reduce
  certain observations on the boiling point of water, made by the au
   thor in the Alps, in 1842.

                                      413
    He considered that it has       been    too generally   assumed that the
boiling point corresponds       to a barometric     pressuro which expresses
the elasticity of steam taken from the usual tables.            He, therefore,
attempted to deduce the connection of these data by a direct com
parison of cases, in which both the barometer and boiling point were
noticed by himself.        Ho finds this result, that the pressures in
crease,   rigorously in   a geometrical    ratio,  whilst the temperature of
the boiling point rises uniformly.         This law is not new, for Deluc
arrived at tho same result ; but it appears to have been considered
by all late writers as unworthy of adoption, and the scale of the
 elasticities of vapour by Dalton or Ure has been preferred.             Now,
these elasticities cannot, it is well known, be accurately represented
 by a geometrical proportion to the temperature ; but Professor Forbes
 finds that the geometrical ratio represents the barometric heights
 exactly, whilst the tabular elasticities do not.          But, farther, since
 the common barometric formula shews that the pressure varies geo
 metrically, whilst the height above the sea varies uniformly, we
 have the same form      of relation   between    the boiling   point and the
 barometric    pressure as between the height above the sea and the
 barometric pressure, namely, that each is as the logarithm of the
 other.     Hence the boiling point falls exactly in proportion          to the
 height ascended, and at the rate of 549.5 feet for 1° Fahr.

 Papers on Glaciers.       No. 3, On the Structure of Glaciers, and
       the cause of their motion.         By Professor Forbes.
    With referonce    to  his former paper of the 27th February, tho
author stated, that he had received a most satisfactory confirmation
of his opinion respecting tho motion of glaciers in winter.        From
observations made     by his direction on the Mer de Glace of Cha-
mouni, and in which ho places entire confidence, it appears that the
 ice moved no less than 76 feet between tho 12th December 1842
and 17th February 1843, or at tho rate of 13£ inches per diem,
whilst its mean motion during the summer was 17£ inches.
    The author then explained the manner in which he conceives tho
conoidal structuro of glaciors to be due to tho varying velocity of
different points of their section producing discontinuity by minute
fissures, which aro infiltratod and ultimately frozen.     lie had before
satisfied himself that the forms of these surfaces are such as the mo
tion of tho particles of a viscid fluid, obstructed by the sides and bot
tom of the canal in which it moves, would engender.         But to make
this more palpable, he has endeavoured to imitate the motion of a
glacier, by causing a plastic fluid of different colours to mould itself
by tho action of gravity in an inclined bed, and he has thus succeed
ed in reproducing tho forms of the structural surfaces of glaciers so
precisely that they cannot be distinguished from the curves which he
had drawn as representing the actual phenomena. — See Edinburgh

   Professor     Forbes      also    mentioned tho objection recently taken by
M. Agassiz to this theory of the veined structure being                       due to the
different velocity of parallel portions of tho ice, namely, that where
two glacier streamers unite, their structure remains separate and
distinct.     Professor      Forbes admits that it         does so   for a certain dis
tance after union, but affirms,   that, if the glacier be long enough,
the structure    always tends to consist  of a single series of curves.
He    shewed,    by models formed by the union of two plastic streams,
that, in point of fact, such phenomena of united streams may be re
produced, the doublo structure being very slowly worn out, in con
sequence    of the nearly uniform movement of the middle part of                      tho
stream.
     Professor   Forbes             the proofs that the glacier moves
                              recapitulated
as a plastic mass, the friction of whose parts is less than their fric
tion upon the surface over which they tend to slide ; and he bases his
theory upon three classes of facts, which he considers that ho has
demonstrated.          1.That the glacier moves like a stream, fastest at
tho centre.       2.   That its velocity is immediately governed by the
external temperature and the state of infiltration of the ice by water
at the time.  3. That the forms which its veined structure assumes
are those due to the movement                of   a semi-solid mass    in the manner
supposed.

1 .  Observations on the Temperature and Hygrometric state
      of the Island of Barbadoes.          By R. Lawson, Esq., As
      sistant-Surgeon    of H. M. 47th Regiment. Communicated
      by Henry Marshall, Esq.
    This paper contains an account of the Thermometric and Hygro
metric observations made at the Barbadoes, from May 1841 to Jan
uary 1842.     The instruments were carefully verified and observed      ;
and, during threo months, the temperature was ascertained for 18
hours out of tho 24.     The author thence deduces tho form of the
daily curve of temperature for that period.
2.   On the Growth and Migration of the Sea-Trout (Salmo
      Trutta). By Mr John Shaw, Drumlanrig.                  Communi
      cated by James Wilson, Esq.
    The author  has  here pursued the same course of experimental
enquiry regarding the sea-trout, as that formerly followed in rela
tion to the salmon.    Having obtained impregnated ova, from a pair
of spawning fish, he conveyed these ova to his experimental ponds.
This was on 1st November 1839, and the young were excluded
from tho egg in 75 days.          They resembled salmon of the same
age, but were somewhat smaller and paler.           They took two years
to grow about seven inches, and the majority        were  then converted
into smolts. But about one-fourth did not assumo the silvery lustre ;
and this peculiarity, Mr Shaw thinks, distinguishes a like proportion
even in the rivers.    He then experimented       on   the smolts in the
natural streams, and found, that, after descending to the sea, they
returned as hcrlings (Salmo albus of Dr Fleming) in July and
August, with   an  addition    to their weight of seven or eight ounces.
These hcrlings spawn towards the end of the season of their first
ascent ; and, after revisiting tho sea, they ascend the rivers again in
tho ensuing months of May and June, with an average weight of
2J lb. This increase takes place almost entirely in the sea. After
spawning for the second      time,  they descend  for the third time to

                                      417
the sea, and make their appearance again in fresh water in the
course of the ensuing summer, weighing 4 lbs.           They are now in
their fifth year, including    the   two seasons  they had passed as fry,
anterior to the assumption of the migratory dress and instinct.        De
scending seawards for the fourth time, they weigh about 6 lbs., when
next seen in the rivers, in the course of their sixth summer.        These
at least were the progressive changes and ratio of increase ob
served by Mr Shaw, in specimens distinctively marked, and care
fully noted, when retaken in the river Nith successively from year
to year.    The peculiar marks imposed each season are detailed in
his paper, and the whole subject is illustrated by an extensive series
of specimens, from the day of hatching,        to the middle   of the sixth
year.    These specimens are now in the Society's Museum.
3.   Experiments with Hydro- and Thermo-Electric Currents ;
       and an Examination of Metals long exposed to Thermo-
       Electric Currents.        By R. Adie, Esq. Communicated
       by Dr Traill.
     The author commences his paper with a description of two
forms of Electric Batteries, which he used in his experiments, and
which consisted of bars of antimony and bismuth.            One of these,
which was chiefly intended for currents excited by solar and astral
influences, was   so  delicate as to make the needle       of the galvano
meter deflect at right angles, when one end of the battery was ex
posed to the influence of clear summer's sun ; and he therefore
considers it a very delicate meteorological instrument.         The other
form of battery was principally used for thermo-electric currents,
from a low flame of gas, or a spirit-lamp.
    With the former instrument he succeeded in decomposing cyanide
of silver, by exposure to the air for three months in winter, even
although the voltameter,      in connection with the battery, was often
exposed to frost.
    In  using the second form of instrument, he remarked, that water
is decomposed by copper poles, but not by poles of platinum, — a
fact, which   appears to him       to  account for Professor   Daniell not
having been able to produce electrolysis by primary thermo-currents.
He farther observed, that metallic salts yield readily to a thermo-
current, when the poles consist of the metal whose        oxide forms the
base of the salt.
    On   examining   the effect     of long-continued  electrolysis on  the

                                     418
metals constituting the battery, he found that no appreciable change
was caused in tho antimony by a current maintained for four months,
and strong enough to cause, in 164 days, tho deposition of a quan
tity of copper in the voltameter, equal to tho weight of the battery.
But tho junctures of tho bismuth and antimony, which were sol
dered   by pure bismuth,      presented an important      change, even   in
thirty or forty days, — the bismuth soldering having undergone a
species of disintegration, so that the antimonial bar was easily sepa
rated, and the surface of the bismuth lost its crystalline appearance,
and might bo rubbed off in tho form of a fine powder.           The author
proved,  that   this  change  could not  bo  the  effect merely of the heat
to which the metals were       exposed, but is truly an electric     pheno
menon.      Changes were also found to be effected, by long-continued
electric currents, in the specific gravity of the metals.        Antimony
had its density raised, after exposure for twenty-two days to a ther
mo-electric current, from 6.645 to 6.670 ; and the density of bis
muth was diminished from 9.853 to 9.838.
    In pursuing his experiments with hydro-currents,         he found, that
the elimination      of hydrogen from a copper wire soon comes to an
end   under the influence of pressure caused by the accumulation of
gas in a hermetically     sealed space around    the wire, while the depo
sition of copper goes on.       By hydro-currents, aided by pressure, he
obtained leaf-liko deposits    of metal, in solutions of common salt, with
poles of copper, tin, silver, and zinc, and pulverulent deposits with
gold, mercury, antimony, cobalt, platinum, and arsenic.           But when
iron, bismuth, cadmium, and nickel were used, no deposition took
place, — the hydrogen continuing to be disengaged, till tho voltame
ter burst.
    To theso investigations the author added some experiments on
the effects of quick and slow cooling, in altering the densities of
metals.     He found, that antimony loses in density by sudden cool
ing  ; that this metal, and also bismuth, do not gain in density by
slow cooling; that by this process the density of lead, tin, and zinc
is increased  ;   that copper and silver are densest when allowed to
cool_slowly   ;  that iron   undergoes no change by slow cooling, un
less first heated very strongly, in which case its density is diminished ;
and that steel loses in density by the process of hardening,       but does
not lose by repeated heating.
    Lastly, in conformity with the experiments of Bequercl, on the
developemcnt of electric currents, by sudden alterations in the den
 sity of metals, tho author found, that, when the density of gold, pla

                                     419
tinum,   cadmium,   silver,  and iron, was increased, by passing them
through the drawing-plate,      a deflection of from one to four degrees
was occasioned in the galvanometer : but with lead and tin no per
ceptible deflection was occasioned.

      canthemum, and on three Proximate Principles which
      they contain.   — Conclusion.      By Dr Hope.
   The author first called the attention of the meeting to the prin
cipal facts which he had established in the two memoirs read to the
Society in the year 1836.       1st,  Of  these   the most important arc,
that when acids    cause a red colour,    and alkalis    a green or bluish
vegetable infusion,  they act ond ifferent      substances   ;
                                                               — the  acids on

                                         420
erythrogen, and the alkalis on xanthogen.     2dly, That the com
pound of alkalis and xanthogen is of a yellow colour, and that when
a blue infusion is changed to green,           it   is owing to the gradual inter
mixture of the newly generated yellow with the original blue.
  Camellia Japonica. — The blossoms of the beautiful double white
Camellia Japonica are remarkable for the peculiar matters which they
contain, two of which appear to be distinct vegetable principles.
When      a parcel     of the   petals   is infused     in boiling-hot            water, and
digested for some time, a nearly colourless infusion is obtained, which
is not visibly affected by acids.          When solution of potash                 is added, a
light orango colour appears, which gradually                        deepens,    till in   a few
hours it acquires a very deep orange hue.               of ammonia  Solution
causes a similar effect.   When lime-water is employed, it produces
turbidity in the infusion, and a pinkish rod colour.     This colour
gradually assumes   a  richer tint, and in about 24 hours exhibits a
deep     pinkish   red.      The author applied the same alkalescent
                                            has
agents     to above 150 flowers, both white and coloured, without ob
serving any similar effect.
   To this colourable matter he gives the name of Camelline.      The
author tried the effects of various reagents, but no interesting facts
resulted.
   When any portion of the flower-leaf is bruised, whether remain
                                                           it,
ing on the parent plant or removed from        immediately begins to
                                                           it
assume a rusty or ochry tint, which grows deeper and deeper, till                            it
arrives at the tint of perfect ochre.
   By various experiments,      was proved that this change of colour
                                    it
dopends upon the action of the oxygen of the air.    It takes place in
a very remarkable degree   in oxygen gas, and does not take place at
all when the contact of air    excluded
                                    is                by
                                           an immorsion in mercury,
in hydrogen, or carbonic acid gas.    To this brown-growing matter,
viewing   asit     a  distinct vegetable principle, Dr Hope gavo the name
of Magnoline,        in consequence of its occurring in    very remarkable
                                                                        a
degree in the Magnolia grandiflora and Magnolia conspicua.    A third
remarkable circumstance respecting the Camellia petals, is, that they
contain    a   notable quantity of iron.            This was little to           be expected,
seeing that iron       is   so common a source        of colour, and the           blossom    is
 entirely colourless.         The author    was led to search for this metal in
 consequence of the strong resemblance which the colour which prot
 oxide and protocarbonato of iron acquire by the absorption of oxy
                                              the bruised petals of
                                                            is by
 gen from the air, and tho colour acquired
 the Camellia bear to each other.            Dr Hope                satisfied   that the ochry

                                        421
   tints of the Camellia    are in no way dependent on, or connected    with,
   tho iron which it contains.
      Magnolia      Ghandiflora.   —   When the petals of the Magnolia
   Grandiflora    are  boiled  for some  time in distilled water, a liquor of
   a very light yellowish brown is obtained.        This colour is banished
   by sulphuric acid.   Solution of potassa immediately causes a deep gall
   stone yellow, shewing that this, like other white flowers, contains no
   erythrogen, but abounds in xanthogen.         That matter, which becomes
   of an ochry hue by the contact of air, is very abundant in the Mag
  nolia, so that, if the cuticle be scraped off, in less than a minute the
  place   of abrasion exhibits the ochry tint. The petals of the snow-
  white Magnolia conspicua exhibit the same phenomena in a still
  more remarkable degree.          If a petal of this beautiful flower be
  bruised between the fingers and thumb it immediately becomes of a
  very deep brown, and ere long almost black.             Some other white
  flowers, by being crushed and exposed to the air, also acquire the
  ochry tint, but in a much inferior degree to those already men
  tioned.     Tho ochry-growing     matter is not confined to white flowers.
  It  exists in different species of the blue flowers of the Aconitum, par
  ticularly the napellus.
      The third flower of which Dr Hope gave           an  account, was tho
  Chrysanthemum       leucanthemum, the ox-eye daisy.        A strong decoc
  tion of the white petals exhibits    a light brown colour, which potash
  quickly converts into the usual gallstone yellow.         When sulphuric
 acid is dropped into this decoction, the colour becomes a light prim
 rose yellow, and the liquid immediately assumes a gelatinous state.
 This jelly gradually     becomes   more consistent, and, in about a quar
 ter of an hour, it is   so firm that the capsule containing it may be in
 verted without the jelly falling out. The matter thus gelatinized by
 sulphuric acid is peculiar to this plant.       The author has applied sul
 phuric acid to the infusion of at least 150 flowers, without any simi
 lar result taking place. The author conceives that the gelatinising
 matter is a distinct vegetable principle, to which he gave the name
of Leucanthemine.        To support this view, he drew a comparison be
tween it and the coagulablo matters both of the animal and vege
table kingdoms, viz. animal albumen, casein, fibrin, and vegetable al
bumen.       In  drawing this comparison, the author described some re
markable properties of these albuminous matters, which have escaped
the observation of all the investigators of the chemistry of organic
substances, and some of which he had beon in the habit of exhibiting
in his lectures for nearly half a century. These are, principally, that

                                       422
 sulphuric acid dissolves the albuminous matters in the cold, and yields
 a nearly colourless solution, without altering the nature of the albu
 men.     But   if the liquor be heated to 160°, it acquires an extremely
 beautiful rich crimson hue, during which change the nature of the
 albumen     is  totally altered.    Muriatic acid    acts  upon albuminous
 matter nearly in the same manner         ; but the colour which the solution
 acquires by being heated is a very rich purple.           The jelly from the
 Leucanthemum affords no crimson colour with sulphuric acid.             After
 pointing out other circumstances of difference, the author           gave his
 opinion that the Leucanthemino         ought to be considered as a distinct
 substance     #wt  generis, another vegetable principle; and concluded
 with expressing his hopo that the Camellia, Magnolia, and Chrysan
 themum furnish three to the long list of vegetable proximate            prin
 ciples.
 2.  On certain Negative Actions of Light. By Professor Moser
       of Kcenigsberg.         In a Letter to Sir David Brewster.
    " There     are certain actions of light which may be called negative
 actions.                      I
             By this namo mean to indicato a series of new actions,
without    pretending to enter into any theoretical considerations.         In
acting upon an iodised plato, common light produces successively
different states, which are made manifest by exposing tho plate, when
taken out of the camera, to the vapours of mercury.              If the plate
has romained in the camera but a short time, we shall see only tho
first traces of an image.        The parts most strongly affected by the
light   condense     tho  mercurial vapour only in small quantities.         If
the light acts during a longer time, the image will appear with more
details and more distinctly,      tho mercurial    vapours being condensed
moro abundantly.         By increasing tho time of action, tho image gains
in details, but the parts which havo been affected with a strong light
condense    the mercurial vapours in smaller quantities.         Tho images
that exhibit many details have usually at the same              timo a grey
aspect,   arising from the mercurial vapours having already begun to
blacken tho iodised silver.        If the plate remains still longor in the
camera, it does not present any visible image        ;  but when exposed to
the mercurial      vapours, there is produced an image wholly negative.
The parts which have been too long acted upon by an intense light
condenso little vapour, and hence bocomo completely black, whilo the
parts which were in shadow condense much vapour, and appear white
Hence arises the peculiar aspect of the image. When this period of

                                     423
action is exceeded,   the plate comes out of the camera with a visible
 image, which the vapours of mercury scarcely affect.           This species
 of images is well known to experimentalists, and they have not
hitherto been applied to any useful purpose.
   " Now, when any one of the above states of the image has taken
place, we may always, and easily, cause the image to retrograde on
the plate, and arrest it at any anterior state we please.            For ex
ample,   I  leave the iodised plate 300         minutes   and more in the
camera, whereas 10 minutes are sufficient to produco an ordinary Da
guerreotype picture.     When this plate is withdrawn from the camera,
it presents  a distinct negative image.        I then expose the plate du
ring 22 seconds to the vapours of iodine, and then to those of mer
cury, and the result of this is the production of a splendid Daguerreo
type picture.    The vapour of the iodine has, therefore, caused the
action of the light to retrograde.      I   have repeated   and varied these
experiments in every way, and always with the same success, taking
care not to allow the vapours of iodine to act too long, otherwise they
would completely destroy tho action of the light.
   " There are many other bodies which, in their
                                                          gaseous state, pro
duce the same negative actions, when applied to an iodised plate,
such as chlorine, bromine, the hydro-fluoric acid, &c. &c.       ; but I shal
not enlarge on this point, because        I  have to mention to you a gas
much more interesting, viz. oxygen, which exercises the same nega
tive action.
   " Having left the iodised plate from
                                           four to six times the period    ne
cessary for an ordinary picture in the camera, and exposed it to pure
oxygen during a few seconds, tho mercurial vapours produce the or
dinary image.     The oxygen in atmospheric air acts also upon the
plate, and requires only that the action bo prolonged.          If  we expose
a plate with an imago that would       become     negative by mercurial va
pour, during one or two minutes, to a current         of air from a pair of
bellows that would raise a  column of water four or five inches high, tho
imago will be presently brought back to its ordinary state ; or if tho
blast is continued longer, to any other anterior state, tho primordial
state not excepted.     Atmospheric air, indeed, quite calm, exercises
also these negative actions, provided its action is continued for some
hours.
   "  I may also add, that among the gases      which compose atmospheric
air, oxygen alone produces      these negative effects.       Nitrogen, car
bonic acid, and the vapour of water, do not produco them ; tho latter,
however, produces the effects which       I  have described in my     Memoir

                                        424
 on the    Latent State of Light.        These negative actions are never
 produced by any       of the rays  of solar  light.
                                                              I
     " It appears to me that these new facts, of which have communi
 cated    to you the most remarkable, lead to important results.               It
 naturally follows from them, that the oxygen of the atmosphere will
 retard the action of light, and tend to preserve the surfaces of bodies
 in their primordial condition.        I have, without success, endeavoured
 to make a direct       experiment    on  this subject.    I  placed a camera-
 obscura under the receiver of an air-pump, and exhausted the air               ;
 the time, however, for producing any particular effect of light did
 not change ; but the air-pump was so imperfect, that it did not pro
 duce a rarefaction      beyond five or six inches of the barometer.          In
 the    mean    time, however,    I  may adduce      some  of my experiments
 communicated seven months ago to           the Academy of Sciences at Ber
 lin, which prove, at least indirectly, what the air-pump has not yet
 verified.     If  we wet an iodised plate of silver with any fat oil, we
 shall find that the time in which light produces any particular effect
 is greatly diminished.        In applying, for example, oil of olives, the
 plate will be four or five times more sensitive ; so that, instead of four
or five minutes, one minuto only will be necessary to produce the
same effect      in the camera. The mercurial vapour readily penetrates
the thin film of oil, and produces very perfect images.              This singu
lar action of oils arises probably from their obstructing, or, at least,
enfeebling, the negative action of oxygen gas. The mercurial vapours
produce even a better developed image, that is to say, one which cor
responds to a more prolonged action of light, if we apply the oil only
at the instant the plate is taken out of the camera.
       I
    " believo that these
                             negative actions, which bring back the surfaces
of    bodies to   their natural state, will throw     some light upon the pro
cess    of vision,  because the samo effects seem to take place upon the
retina.      But   I greatly regret that   I   am not able to enter into any
                                             I
details on this interesting subject, as am wholly occupied with other
researches, particularly on a very remarkable and different kind of
action exerted by hydrogen gas."
3.    On the Specific Gravity of certain Substances commonly
         considered lighter than Water.             By Dr Davy.
     The author enters on the subject by adverting              to the apparent
lightness imparted to the common woods, and to certain vesicular
minerals, by the entanglement of air in their substance, as is com
monly understood, and as is proved by the action of the air-pump.

                                       425
The specific gravity of oak-wood, after having been kept under the
exhausted receiver till it sunk in water, and ceased to give off air, he
found to be (inclusive of hygrometric moisture) 1.58 ; that of deal,
1.18, or when crushed about 1.5         ; that of the pith of the elder, 1.45 ;
and that of pumice, 1.94, or crushed, 2.41, which is nearly the same
as that of obsidian, from which pumice appears to be formed by the
action of volcanic fire.
     Reasoning analogically, the question naturally occurred, are there
 not other substances, commonly considered lighter than water, which
 are   so only in appearance, owing, it may be, to air adhering to their
 surface, or included in them, such as cork, caoutchouc, camphor, wax,
 spermaceti,    cholesterine, stearine    ?
     Cork, he finds, continues to float      on water, after having been kept
 under the exhausted receiver nearly two months.            This he attributes
 to the elasticity   of the plates constituting its cells, confining a very
 minute quantity of air, that cannot be extracted by the pump.
 When the cells are broken, it sinks in water. From indirect ex
 periments, he infers its specific gravity to be about 1.6, or nearly
 the same as that of lignin.
      In common caoutchouc, he detected            the presence of air by the
 microscope, which, owing to the peculiar quality of this substance,
 could not be separated either by the air-pump, or by compression,
 or by boiling.      Dissolved in ether, and precipitated by alcohol, he
 found it apparently of specific gravity .97 ; allowing for circumstances
 interfering with accuracy of result, he conjectures that the specific
 gravity of caoutchouc is about the same as that of water.
      The specific gravity of camphor, ho concludes from his experi
 ments, to exceed a very little that of water, viz. as 1.005 to 1.000           ;
 that of bees' wax, and also that of spermaceti and of stearine, to be
 about the same as that of water at the temperature 50°, though
  considerably lighter at the boiling         temperature of water   ; and that
  of cholesterine   to be a  little higher, viz. 1.0102.
      In  conclusion, ho expresses the opinion, that attention to the spe
  cific gravities of the substances under consideration, may be useful
  in conducting chemical analyses of compound bodies in which they
  may be contained ; that a consideration of the cause of their appa
  rent lightness, viz. included or adhering air, may help to explain
  some     rather  obscure  phenomena, — as the raising        of cream, &c.     ;
  and that attention may be deserving of being paid to the same cause,
  as exemplified in the substancos treated of, whenever, in works of
  art, unusual lightness or buoyancy is a desideratum.

    The following Communications           were read   : —
1.   On the presence of Organic Matter in the purest Waters
      from Terrestrial Sources.         By Professor Connell.
   It  must be well known to chemists, that when solution of acetate of
lead is added to the transparent and colourless water of springs, wells,
and rivers, a more or loss dense white cloud is almost invariably pro
duced.     This reaction  has been usually attributed to the presence     of
inorganic salts, such as carbonates, sulphates, and muriates ; but it
will be found that, generally speaking, this precipitate is formed
even after tho water has been boiled ; that     it is usually dissolved by
the speedy addition of a drop or two either of acetic or of nitric acid,
without visible effervescence ; and that the agency of the water with
nitrate of silver is commonly too small to admit of its being caused
by any muriate.       Theso facts exclude tho idea that it is due in the
general case to carbonates, sulphates, phosphates, or muriates ; al
though,    of course,  in those particular   cases  where the water has
enough of such constituents to affect acetate of lead, the reactions
will be modified accordingly.      Thus, in some cases, where the first
action is as above stated, a deposition tak«s placo aftor a certain in
terval of sulphate of lead, no longer soluble in weak acids.

                                             427
     It
      occurred to tho author that the truo cause of the reaction was
to be found in the presence of organic matter in the water, derived
from tho decomposition of vegetable matter in tho strata or soil
through which it had passed.       To ascertain whother this view was
correct, the precipitate by aoetate of lead from several quarts of the
town water of St Andrews was decomposed by sulphuretted hydro
gen.      After filtration,       a    obtained, which, besides sul
                                      liquid   was
phuric acid derived from precipitated sulphate of lead, was found to
contain some organic matter apparently of an azotisod nature ; but
its amount was too small to characterise its properties with accuracy.
The salt obtained by saturating the liquid with potash, yielded by
distillationempyreumatic vapour, and loft a black coaly mass be
hind.   The liquid itself, when neutralized and sufficiently diluted,
had still a marked action on lead salts ; and it or its potash salt
produced more or less precipitate after the interval of a day or two,
in acetato of copper and neutralized persulphate of iron.
      Tho author    found this matter in the town waters of Edin
                     has
burgh and Glasgow, but to a less extent than in that of St Andrews.
Tho Glasgow water shewed the least of the three. He has also
found it more or less in every instance he has hitherto tried of trans
parent and colourless well, spring, or river water.  In rain water it
does not exist, and probably could not be found in springs above tho
limits of vegetation, or in snow or glacier water.    It would seem
that it ought to perform functions of some importance in the econo
my of nature, as contributing in a certain degree to the nourishment
of plants and       evon     of animals.

 3.    Notice regarding the Bebeeru Tree of British Guiana.                      By
          Dr A. Douglas Maclagan.
       Tho plant bearing the above Indian name, and also called Sipoeri
 by     the Dutch colonists, furnishes tho hard and heavy timber known
 by    the name of Greenheart.     The object of the present paper was to
 state the result of experiments made                by the author on tho bark and
 seeds    of the tree, which had           been found by   Mr Rodie, R. N.,   to con
 tain     a   vegetable alkali possessed of tho power of checking intermit

                                           428
   tent fevers.      Dr Maclagan     stated   that the tree was unknown to bo
  tanists.     Sir William Hooker and Dr Lindley had           seen the  fruit and
  declared it to be lauraceous, but the author had been unable to find, in
  Rees v. Esenbeck's Sy sterna Laurinarum, any genus or even sub
  order of lauraceous plants to which he could refer it.            With regard
  to its chemical qualities, Dr M. stated that he had obtained both
 from the bark and seeds two distinct            alkalis,  both uncrystallizable,
 to one      of which he applied Mr Rodie's name, Bebeerine ; to the
 other he gave the name of Sipeerine.              They could be separated by
 anhydrous ether, the bebeerine being soluble in that menstruum,
 whilst the sipeerine       was   not.    Dr M. had likewise obtained,       espe
 cially from the seeds, a peculiar crystallizablo and deliquescent acid,
 which he called Bebeeric acid, and which seemed to be distinct from
 every vegetable acid hitherto described.
     The author stated that he had instituted experiments with a view
 to ascertain     if  a soluble salt  of the alkalis could be procured, which
 might      bo used    as a substitute for sulphate of quinine when dear.
 He    stated,   as the result  of his trials, that the produce did not amount
to more than ono         and a-half of sulphate per cent, from the bark, but
he    still calculated that    if the bark could be got at a moderate price,
the salt of the alkalis might be prepared at a cost inferior to that of
 sulphate of quinine.        Dr Maclagan stated that the bark appeared to
be better suited for the purposes         of manufacture than the    seeds.   The
author mentioned that sulphate prepared under his directions had
been sent out to Demerara, and had been tried there with marked
success      in intermittent    fever by   Dr Watt    ;  he had likewiso used it
with success in a few cases of ague in Edinburgh, and also in periodic
headache,       so that he had no doubt of its possessing considerable
power as an antiperiodic remedy.              Lastly, he mentioned that a so-
cret preparation sold under the name of " Warburg's Fever Drops,"
reputed a good antiperiodic, appeared to him to be a tincture of be-
beeru seeds.

1.    An attempt to explain the Phenomena of the Freezing
       Cavern at Orenburg. By Dr Hope.
     Dr Hope in the first place read, from the Proceedings of the Geo
logical Society in London, the account of the freezing cavern fur
nished by the President of the Geological Society of London.     This
is one of several caves which exist in the southern face of a length
ened low hillock         of gypsum.     It is   entered from the south by a pas
sage      rather    narrow, and is about fifteen feet high, ten paces long,
and seven wide, which seemed to send off irregular fissures into the
body of the rock.
     The extraordinary        feature of this cavern        is,   that during summer
it  so cold that ice
     is                generated in it, and dry icicles hang from its
                             is
roof and that, in winter, all appearance of congelation ceases, and
      ;
the temperature becomes such that the Russians say they could sleep
in    without their sheep-skins.
     it
     Mr Murchison        applied to   Sir John Herschel for an explanation,
and the theory which he proposed                is,   that the heat and cold of the
surface gradually        move, though very slowly, backward into the rock             ;

                                                430
that it requires six months for the wave of cold, as he terms    to                      it,
reach the cavern, and consequently, that that frigid wave begins to
arrivo at the commencement of summer, and continues during that
season,     occasioning such       a    degree     of cold in the cavern          as to pro
duce tho congolations described by                  Mr Murchison.
  At      the commencement of winter, the first effect of the summer's
heat    arrives,       and   continues       without      interruption, and         occasions
warmth enough to prevent congelation.
  Dr Hope entirely concurred with Sir                      John Herschel in thinking
that alternato waves of heat and cold must exist and have                            a   share
in producing           the phenomena,           and in corroboration         quoted the ob
servations of Saussuro, that at Geneva tho winter's cold requires
six    months      to descend       294-        feet,   and that   the   summer's            heat
penetrates        to    the samoin a similar period of time
                                        depth               the                          ;
maximum of cold taking place at mid-summer, and of heat at mid
winter.
      But   ho also expressed his conviction that theso alternate waves were
not sufficient to account for tho phenomena, further remarking, that
were they the only powers employed, the paradoxical phenomena
should occur equally in some of the other caverns of the Orenburg
hillock, or in other caverns in different quarters of the globe. He
obsorved, that there must be something peculiar to the Illetykaya
Zatchita cavern which renders   the only cavo in the world which
                                             it
possessesthe singular property, so far as he knew.  He then                                    al
luded to the caverns in different parts of tho globe in which ac
cumulations of snow are found in summer,                        and concurred with            Mr
Murchison  in thinking that they have no analogy with that of Oren
burg.   They are merely receptacles of the winter snow and ice, and
preserve   during summer, after the manner of an ice-house.
             it
    Tho circumstance peculiar to the Orenburg cave                           is   the occur
 rence of the rents and fissures which rise from tho                           back part of
 the cavern.
      The author       stated,   that   ifit    were granted that these fissures reach
 tho surface, even by tho smallest ramifications,and that they ascend
 within the reach of the alternate waves of heat and cold, tho whole
 phenomena may be easily and satisfactorily                     explained.        He ascribed
 the summer's coldness and congelation to   constant current of cold
                                                            a
 air through the fissuros of the rock into the cavern and he sup             ;
 posed that the current           is    occasioned in the following manner           :   When

                                      431
at the close of spring      tho temperaturo   of tho external      ah- and of
that in tho rents is tho same, no particular occurrence takes place             ;
but as soon      as  the wave    of cold begins to make impression           on
the rocky parietes of the fissures, then the air in them will                 be
somewhat      cooled, contracted,     and  rendered    specifically    heavier.
This    being so, the weight   of the column of air in those rents will be
greater than that of a column of equal altitude of the external at
mospheric air, and the consequence will necessarily be, that the colder
air will descend, the warmer atmospheric air from above will supply
its place, which, in its turn, will be cooled and descend, and thus a
current of cold air through the crevices into and through the cavern
will be established. As the temperature of tho rocky parietes
gradually falls with each successive wave of cold, the air in the
fissures will become colder and colder, and in the same             proportion
will   descend   more rapidly.
    But the rapidity of    descent  does not only depend upon tho increas
ing coldness of the air in the fissures, but is further augmented by
the warmth of tho summer expanding the external air, so that tho
differenco of weight between the extornal and internal columns be
 comes greater.       In tho manner now explained, a current of cold
 air is constantly descending and flowing through tho cavern, produc
ing all the surprising frigorific effects displayed within it.
    That such a current does exist, Mr Murchison gives a satisfactory
proof; he says, " That upon unlocking tho frail door of the cavern, a
 volume of air, so surpassingly keen, struck the legs and tho feet, that ho
 was glad to rush into a cold bath in front of him to equalize the effect."
This downward current will continuo the         same   till tho  close   of  au
 tumn, when its course comes to bo changed       ; by that time the    first ap
proaches of May'ssurface warmth will begin to be experienced, the cold
of the sides of the rents begins to diminish, and tho temperature of the
 external air must have fallen to nearly that of the internal current.
 As   soon as an equality between the temperatures and densities          of the
 external and internal     columns shall have been established, all current
 must cease.      At this period, namely, the commencement of winter,
 the wave    of the summer's heat begins to reach both the walls of tho
 air-channels and of the cavern, and gradually communicates a warmth
 which progressively elevates the temperature, and dissipates every
 mark of the preceding summer's congelation.               It might at first
 bo reasonably expected, that at this timo the preceding order        of things
would bo reversed,      and that  a current in the opposito direction would

                                    432
commence, such as, it is known, happens in many mines            ;  for, un
doubtedly, the    temperature of the atmosphere descending rapidly,
the gravity     of the external air would soon exceed that of the
internal    column.   A   current  would immediately      commence      from
below,    and, entering from the cavern door and ascending through
the rents, escape at the surface.     The consequence of such a current
would be, that the cold would soon reappear in the cave, and
gradually increase during the severity of the winter, and completely
overpower the heating influence of the thermal wave, now beginning
to operate on the walls of the cavern, and so prevent tho warmth of
the cave during winter.
    An occurrence, however, now takes place which puts a stop to the up
ward draught, and permits tho thermal wave to have its full influence
on the temperature     of the cavern.   The winter commences with re
peated falls of snow, which form a     thick covering on the surface of
the earth, and closes up all the communications       between the extre
mities of the crevices and the external     air, and no current can take
place.     In this manner the influx of the intensely cold air into the
cavern, and its ascent through the fissures, is prevented, and then full
play is given to the calorific power of the wave of heat which con
tinues to arrive in the cavern through its rocky sides during the
 whole continuance of winter, and communicates the warmth recorded
 by  Mr Murchison.      In the beginning of summer the     snows melt, and
 the terminations and ramifications of the fissures have their commu
 nication with the atmosphere restored.      The currents, as already de
 scribed, are re-established, and all the paradoxical phenomena to
 which they give birth present themselves in due succession.
 2.   Observations    on the Temperature of the          Earth in India.
        By John Caldecott, Esq. Communicated               in a Letter to
        Professor Forbes.
     These thermometers, made by      Mr Adie of Edinburgh,      were sunk
 in tho ground at Trevandrum, in lat. 8° 3(y 35", to depths of 3, 6,
 and 12 French feet.      Mr Caldecott says, — "    I  send you herewith
 the readings of my long thermometers, which, from various causes,
 I  was  not able to put    into the ground until the 1st of last May
 (1842).      These two months' readings, therefore, will not, of course,
 have the proper temperature      at the respective depths, especially as
 it  has  been  raining more or   less nearly ever since.    Still,  I  think

                                        433
they    will surprise you,  as being (so    far as they go) entirely    opposed
to  Kupffer's opinion, that the superficial temperature of the earth
within the tropics is below that of the air, and to Boussingault's as
sertion, as to the invariability of the temperature one foot below the
surface.      The soil in which the thermometers are buried, is one
which very soon becomes compact again, after having been disturbed,
so that   I  do not think the rain can much affect the thermometers

           Waves.      By  J.  Scott Russell, Esq., M.A., F.RS.Ed.,
           &c
     The object proposed by tho author of this paper, was to present,
  in a complete form, the results of investigations into the phenome
  na of Waves, in which he had been engaged for several years.                 A
  part of the experiments referred to in the paper, had been carried
  on by Sir John Robison, conjointly with the author of this paper,
  as a Committee of the British Association.              The others were new,
  and had been carried on by himself,         for the purpose of completing
  and giving that systematic form to our knowledge of tho subject,
  which was attempted in this paper.
     The author finds that there may exist in agitated water               waves

rent laws, and exhibiting different phenomena.                    These had not hi
therto been sufficiently       distinguished,       and some    of them were   scarce
ly known.     The following          table exhibits the classification resulting
from these investigations         : —

 On the Influence of various Circumstances in Vegetation upon
       the activity of Plants.           Part II.      The Umbelliferous
       Narcotics.     By Dr Christison.
    In the First Part of this inquiry, the author gave an account, in
 1840, of some observations made by him, as to the influence of
season   on the activity of the acrid plants of the natural family
Ranunculacece, and of the narcotics belonging            to the family    Dm-
pacece.*   In   the Second Part now laid before the Society, he pro
ceeded to relate a series of experiments instituted           by him with the
view of determining      the influence of season      on the activity of the
poisonous narcotic plants of the family Umbdliferon.
    The plants belonging to this family are for the most part aromatic
and stimulant, and destitute of poisonous properties.          In  four species
oidy have narcotic properties been unequivocally recognised, viz.,
 Conium maculatum, (Ewmthe crocata, Cicuta virosa, and JEthusa
 Ctjnapium ; but these are universally       held to be highly energetic.
    1. Conium maculatum,       Common       Hemlock.   — No accurate infor
mation is yet possessed as to the influence of season on the activity
of this species ; for all investigations on the subject are vitiated by
the uncertain strength of its preparations, and the ignorance which
prevailed  till very lately  as to the conditions      required lor securing
                   * See the

                                    4:58
their uniformity.       The author has found hy experiment,     as  Profes
sor Geiger had already been led to conclude, that every part of the
plant is poisonous, both the root, the leaves, and the fruit ; and that
the root is least active, the leaves much more so, but the fruit the
most active of .all.     The root is commonly held to be most active in
midsummer, when the plant is in         full vegetation and coming into
flower    ; but this belief is founded only on    a single, and not alto
gether      conclusive,  experiment   made   by  Professor  Orfila.     The
author found this part of the plant to be so feeble at all times, that
its respective energy at different seasons could not be satisfactorily
settled.      The expressed juice of twelve ounces of roots had no appre
ciable effect on a small dog in the end of October or towards the
close of June; but an alcoholic extract of six ounces in the begiuning
of May killed a rabbit in thirty-seven minutes, when introduced into
the cellular tissue.      The leaves are commonly thought to be most
energetic     when  the  plant is coming into flower in midsummer, and
to be very feeble while it is young.       The author finds it to be pro
bable, that the leaves are very active in midsummer ; but he has
likewise observed, that they are eminently energetic in the young
plant, both in the beginning of November, and in the month of
 March before vegetation starts on the approach of genial weather.
Thirty-three grains of a carefully prepared alcoholic extract, repre
senting one ounce and a third of fresh leaves, killed a rabbit in nine
 minutes, when introduced into the cellular tissue.      The fruit is most
 active when it is full grown, but still green and juicy.           It then
 yields much more of the active principle conia than afterwards when
 it is ripe and dry. The author added, as a fact contrary to general
 belief, that he had found the ripe seeds of hemlock, and an alcoholic
 extract of the leaves, to sustain no diminution in energy by keeping,
 at all events for eight years.
     2.  (Enanthe    crocata, Dead-tongue. — This species is universally
 considered to be the most deadly of all the narcotic Umbdliferce.
 Many instances of fatal poisoning with its roots have been published
 during the last two centuries, in the various periodicals of Europe.
 It has repeatedly proved fatal in two hours ; and a portion no bigger
 than a walnut has been thought adequate to occasion death.           Fatal
 accidents have occurred from it in England, France, Holland, Spain,
 and Corsica.      The root would seem from these cases to be the most
 active part ; but few observations are on record as to the effects of
 tho leaves, and none as to the fruit        The root appears from these
 cases to be very active in all seasons, at least in the beginning of

                                      439
 January, the end of March, the middle of April, the middle of June,
 and the middle of August.
    The author proceeded to inquire carefully into the effects of season
 upon this species as it grows wild in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh,
 but was surprised to find that every part of the plant in this locality
 is destitute of narcotic properties at all seasons.  The juice of a whole
 pound of the tubers, the part which has proved so deadly elsewhere,
 had no effect when secured in the stomach of a small dog, either in
 the end of October when the tubers are plump and perfect, but the
 plant not above ground, or in the month of June when it was
 coming into flower     ; and an alcoholic extract of the leaves, and that
prepared from the ripe fruit, had no effect whatever when introduced
into the cellular tissue of a rabbit, under the same conditions in
which the Common Hemlock acts so energetically. By a comparative
 experiment he ascertained that tubers, collected near Liverpool, where
one of the accidents alluded to above happened in 1782, act with
considerable violence on the dog     ; and he briefly noticed some experi
ments,     made   at his request by    Dr Pereira, with the CEnanthe of
Woolwich, shewing that there also it is         a powerful poison to the
lower animals.       Climate   seemed   to the author to furnish the only
adequate explanation        of these extraordinary differences ; yet the
plant grows in all parts of Scotland with great luxuriance.
    3. Cicuta virosa, Water-hemlock. — This species has been also held
to be a deadly poison ever since an express treatise on its effects was
published by Wepfer in 1716; and repeated instances of its fatal
action have been observed since, and some of these very recently, in
 Germany.       The root is the only part which has given occasion to
accidents ; it has proved fatal in two hours and a half.         Neverthe
less, this plant too seems innocuous in Scotland, or nearly so,
although, like the last species, it grows with great luxuriance.        The
juice of a pound of the roots collected in the end of July, while the
plant was in full flower, produced no narcotic symptoms ; and the
only   effects observed, namely, efforts to vomit, might have arisen from
the operation which is necessary to secure the juice in the stomach.
An alcoholic extract of the leaves collected at the       same time, and a
similar preparation made with two ounces of the full-grown seeds,
while still green and juicy, had no effect whatever when introduced
into the cellular tissue of a rabbit, except that inflammation was
excited where the extract was applied.
    4. The author has not yet had an opportunity of trying the       effects
of the fourth species, jEthu&a Cynnpium, or Fool's-parsley.

   The following Communications               were read       : —
1.  A   description of Congenital Malformation of the Auricle
       and External Meatus of both sides in three persons, with
       Experiments on the state of Hearing in them, and Re
       marks on the mode of Hearing by Conduction through
       the hard parts of the Head in general.                       By Professor
       Allen Thomson.
               Read  18<A December    1843, and 2d   January     1844.
   The three persons referred to came accidentally under the obser
vation of the author during the past year. They were from different
parts of the country, and not related to one another.                    In one of
them only was     it ascertained that other members of the             same family
had been similarly affected.
   The first part of the paper contained            a notice     of the history of
these   persons, and an anatomical description               of the malformation
with which they were      affected.      In all the individuals, unsuccessful
attempts had been       made   by different surgeons to uncover a mem

                                        -iU
brana tympani by operation.            In  one of them, it was supposed that
a structure of that nature was          brought into view, but, in the other
two, nothing of that kind could bo seen or felt.             By a comparison
of the external appearances in the last^mentioned individuals, with
observations made in the dissection of similar cases, and more espe
cially from the examination of a specimen preserved in the Anatomi
cal Museum of the University of Edinburgh, the author formed the
conclusion, that, in the majority of such cases, the complete closure
of the bony part of the meatus opposes an insuperable obstacle to
their relief by surgical operation ; and that the malformation visible
externally,      indicates the existence of other defects in the deeper or
middle portion of the organ of hearing.           These defects consist in the
small size and unnatural          shape   and structure of the cavity of the
tympanum        ;  the imperfect condition of the chain of small bones ; the
impossibility of these bones fulfilling their usual office from the
absence of their connection        with  a membraua tympani , and probably
other defects of structure, such as that observed in the specimen
preserved in the Edinburgh Museum, which seems important, as con
sisting in a contracted state of the fenestra rotunda, and the want of
direct communication of that orifice with the cavity of the tympanum,
such, in fact, as would occasion an interruption of the transmission of
vibrations     through the air of the tympanum to the fluid of the laby
rinth.      It   does not appear probable, that the Eustachian tube is
entirely absent in such cases       ; but the size uf its opening into the
tympanum is probably much diminished              in most of them.    In most
of such cases, the labyrinth or internal          ear appears to be natural.
The defective condition          of the bony parts in these cases then
appears to consist mainly in the absence of a part of the tympanic
bone, that, namely, which intervenes between the fissure of Glaser
and the mastoid process, and which forms the tympanic               ring and
auditory process of the temporal bone.
   In    the second part of the paper, the author endeavoured to ex
plain the origin of the malformation in question, by a reference to
the ascertained history         of the development      of the external   and
middle parts of the organ of hearing in the fa'tus of man and ani
mals   :  founding his conclusions more particularly upon the researches
of Huschke, Kathke, Reichert, Giinther, and his own observations
in this point of organo-genesis.          From these, it appeared that mal-
fori'iations of the external and middle ear are, in a great measure,
unconnected in their origin or progress with those of the labyrinth ;
and that, while the latter are related to the earliest changes of for

                                      4t:,
 mation occurring in the brain and cranium, the former may be traced
 to an arrest or imperfection in the development of part of the walls
 of the visceral cavity, more particularly of the two anterior branchial
 arches and the fissure between them.         The incomplete condition of
 the chain of ossicula, and part of the bony wall of the tympanum,
 is attributable mainly to the defective development of the first bran
 chial arch   ;  the want of the tympanic ring and auditory process, and
 the consequent absence of bony meatus, to the deficient development
 of the second branchial arch.         The same observations rendered it
 probable, that the closed condition of the meatus proceeds from a
 preternatural increase of that deposit in the outer part of the first
 branchial fissure, which, in the course of natural development, forms
 the foundation of the septum of the membrana tympani, and thus
 separates  the cavity of the tympanum        and Eustachian  tube on the
inside from the meatus on the outside of this the first branchial fissure.
 The malformation       of the softer part of the meatus extemus, and of
the auricle, is connected with a defect in the development of the
integumental parts of the first and second branchial arches, which
constitutes the latest series of changes occurring in the parts under
consideration,      and, accordingly,  is more frequently defective than
the others.       The very peculiar form of the face, resulting from the
undeveloped        condition of its maxillary, zygomatic, and malar por
tions, together with the existence of cleft palate, to a slight degree,
in two of the individuals described, appeared to the author to
establish still more fully the relation subsisting between the origin
of the malformation of the auricle, meatus, and tympanum, and the
incomplete development of the anterior part of the transitory bran
chial apparatus of the ftetus.
    The third part of the paper contained an account of a series of
experiments performed on the state of hearing in the malformed indi
viduals, and in other persons having the external meatus artificially
plugged.        In all the three malformed individuals, the hearing was
such that they could carry on a conversation with others who spoke
slowly and articulately to them, and in one only was there any degree
of difficulty in this ; and yet, in all of them, sounds must have been
communicated to the ear entirely through the bones of the head.         In
ordinary persons, it is well known, that all sounds which are trans
mitted directly by contact of the sounding body with the hard parte
of the head, are heard with greater intensity when the external ears
are closed   ;   but in them the most complete plugging or obliteration
of the meatus docs not reduce the ear to the condition of that organ

in an aquatic animal, nor entirely remove the effect of the chain of
bones and column of air within the tympanum.           The author shewed,
that in two, at least, of the three malformed individuals, the case was
different, as circumstances existed which obstructed the secondary
action both of the chain of bones and tympanic column of air, so that
these two individuals might be regarded as hearing solely through
the solid parte of the head.       In these two individuals it was ascer
tained, by accurate and frequently-repeated        experiments, that hear
ing  was    not, as in other persons,   most perfect near the site of the
ear, but on the top of the head ; and this was the case whether the
sounds proceeded from a body held in contact with the head, or at
some distance in the air.       So exclusively, indeed, did the hearing
seem to take place     in these two   individuals through the hard parts
of the head, that neither,    but  particularly one of them, seemed ever
to have referred sounds to the ear as the seat of the sensation of
hearing. As might be supposed in such circumstances, these persons
made no distinction between hearing in one ear and in the other ;
and could obtain, •theref ore, no knowledge of the direction of sounds
in tho    same   manner as other people do, by the comparison of the
relative intensity of sounds in the two ears, or in the same ear in
different positions.     The author made some remarks on the amount
of deafness which is calculated to induce dumbness, as well as upon
the means of distinguishing different kinds of deafness,       and the dif
ferent means      that ought to be employed for their relief.      He con
cluded his paper with some remarks upon the subjectof double hearing,
considered with reference to the obvious impossibility, in the indi
 viduals referred to, of the sensations of one ear being distinguished
 from those of the other, in consequence of the perfectly equal and
 simultaneous communication       of sonorous vibrations to both ears.
    2.   On the Luminousness of the Sea.           By Dr Traill.
    The author stated, that this phenomenon seems scarcely to be
 noticed in the writings of Aristotle or of Pliny which have reached
 us, though Pliny was familiar with the light emitted by certain
 shell-fish, and by the Sea Lung or Medusa.
    Mr Boyle gives an account, from the journal of a shipmaster, of
 the luminousness of the sea ; and it is particularly detailed, from per
 sonal observation, in the Indian voyage of Father Bourzes, in 1704.
    The first philosophers, who ascribed it to light emitted by living
 animals, would seem to be the      Abbi Nollet, Professor Vianelli, and
  Dr Gressellini of Venice, about the middle of the last century.       In
  Cook's first voyage, the luminous      properties of several marine ani

                                      447
mals are well described by Banks          and Solander   ;  and in his second
voyage, by Forster.       Spallanzani made some good experiments on the
phosphorescence of a Medusa in the Straits of Messina.
    Since that period, the catalogue of noctilucous         animals has been
greatly enlarged, especially by Peron and Lessueur, the naturalists
to the French Voyages de Decouvertes aux Terres Australes.                   A
good paper on the luminousness             of the sea, by Mr Macartney,
appeared     in   the  London    Phil.   Trans,  for 1810; in which the
phenomenon is ascribed entirely to living animals, an opinion now
generally embraced by naturalists.
    The author then detailed his own experiments and observations
made, from      early life, in different parts of the European Atlantic,
 from lat. 62° to 36° N., chiefly around the shores of Britain, all
which confirmed this opinion.
     He detected, in 1814, several of the same noctilucous animals in
 the waters of the Bay of Biscay as in our own seas, especially the
 Noctiluca miliaris, Orythia minima, and a very minute crustacean,
 seemingly a Zbe.
     Besides these, the Beroe fidgem of Macartney, and several other
 Medusaria, he found two very remarkable animals in the luminous
 waters of the seas around the Western            Isles of Scotland — one an
 ^Equorea, most splendidly phosphorescent, which seems to be
 ^Equorea mesonema of Eschscheltz; and the other a most elegant
  Cydippe, probably the Cydippe pomi/ormin of Paterson.             Both were
 carefully figured from the life by the author, and magnified drawings
 of them were exhibited.
     The paper was concluded by        some strictures on the hypothesis of
 Lamarck, respecting the absence of muscular power and of voluntary
 movements in the order of Rudiaires mollasses.            He gave the results
 of many experiments which he had            made on the movements      of the
 Medusae,   and which convinced him that they possessed considerable
 muscular power, obedient to volition ; and he ascribed the erroneous
  views of Lamarck on this subject to his little familiarity with those
 animals   in their natural haunts     ; for a Medusa swimming     in the  sea,
 and cast on the beach, have very different capabilities of locomotion.

1.   On the Fossil Vegetables of the Sandstone of Ayrshire,
      illustrative of a series of them, as a Donation for the
      Society's Museum.       By J. Shedden Patrick, F.R.S.E.,
      F.R.S.A., &c.
   The author, after mentioning that they were collected by himself
from a quarry on the estate of Mr Warner of Ardeer, in the parish of
Stevenston and district of Cuninghame, shortly described the quarry,
as belonging  in its geological position to the carboniferous group ; and
stated that it is considered the most valuable for white freestone in
the west of Scotland.     He mentioned the different strata in the order
of their occurrence    ;    and stated that coal had been wrought out from
beneath     within the remembrance of the present generation.
           it,                                                     He
said that the fossils are not confined to any one stratum of the sand
stone, but are found in them all, wherever the stone      faulty.  He    is
had counted about five strata at the deepest                 part of the quarry,
separated from each other by thin layers of shale and fossils are    ;
found in all these strata, chiefly, however, where the sandstone                        is
rendered impure by         a   mixture of greenstone and ironstone.               There
have been above thirty different kinds of fossils found in this quarry
(and in the schist connected with the coal) among them many beauti
                                                     ;
ful impressions of Sti/jmarice, Sigillarice, Lepidodendra, and other
plants unknown in the present day.     Among the ferns will be found
Sphenopteris, Neuropteris, Pecopteris, &c.    The fossils which occur
in greatest profusion are the Culumites.   Of these, the two kinds
met with most commonly are Catamites nodosus and C. approximatim.
The following species are also found, but not so frequently, C. can~
nwformix, C. Mougeotii,          C. areiusceus,    and C. verticillatus.
     The Sternborgia       aj/proximata,    designated by Lindley
                                                                              "   a   most
singular   coal-mcasure plant occurring  in most coal-fields in Great
Britain, but not abundant anywhere,"        likewise found here the
                                                   is                             ;
specimens  obtained   are in general small, but one or two fine large
ones have been got      They are usually found in the sandstone, and
are covered with a fine coal, which adheres either in the form of an
even, thick, glossy integument, or in    powdery state, to the surface
                                               a
of the stem.       Some very fine examples of Stenibergiu. nodosa have
likewise been procured.

                                               449
   A    curious fossil, which           he has every reason to believe is original,
was discovered by the author among the debris of the quarry.                                  It
somewhat resembleB              a piece      of tartan, being divided               into regular
parallelograms, by double lines intersecting each other at right angles.
Ho submitted it to the inspection of the Rev. D. Landsborough, and
to other gentlemen in the neighbourhood, who all declared that it was
new to them.    He also shewed it to the manager of the works, and
to some of the most intelligent of the overseers                      and colliers, and they
all said that they had not before met with it ; he therefore ventures
to think it unique.    Mr Landsborough, after minute examination,
bestowed upon it the name of Dictyodendron Patricii, deriving the
generic name from Sutrvov,              a net,    from its close resemblance to net
work, and StvSpov, a tree ; and dedicating                    it,   by the specific name, to
the author, as its discoverer.
   The     Stigmarioe,      which may be said to             be peculiar to, and the dis
tinguishing feature of, the coal-measures, occur plentifully. Among
these  will be found Stigmaria fieoides, S. radxata, and Stigmaria.
Brongniart comes to the conclusion that the Stigmaria and Sigillaria
constitute    peculiar and extinct family (belonging probably to the
                a
gymnospermous division of the Dicotyledons), but of which neither
the fruit nor the leaves are as yet known, and adds, that probably
Stigmaria      only the root of Sigillaria.
                 is
   The Trigonocarpum olivwformce (or fruit of the palm)          very                   is
scarce, being found only in one portion of the quarry, of very small
extent, in the lowest stratum, next to the shale.
   Another fossil met with, but rare, in that district at least, Ha-                     is
lonia tuberetdata.    A very fine specimen was obtained some time
ago, adhering to the surface of the upper stratum of sandstone.
   Of the Lepidodendtra there                    are   several      species   ;    among them
Lcpidodendron             Sternbergii    and L. Hareourtii, and               a    peculiar and
rare variety,with whose specific name                   the author       is   unacquainted.
   Eudogenites striata  also met with.
                                is
   A    very remarkable fossil was discovered in 1842, by the Ecv. D.
Landsborough,            which there    is   every reason to consider as unique.              He
says, that      only very few specimens exist, and that, to the best of his
                        a
belief,   it   has not been found elsewhere. He submitted     to the Philo     it
sophical Society of Glasgow, who report, that
                                                                     " the exposed surface
presents   a    most singular appearance, and           is  unlike any fossil plant which
we have ever seen figured.               Its peculiar      appearance     is   its resemblance
to part of     a   common osier -basket.           Hence, Mr L. used humorously               to
designate      it  '
                       Noah's creel,' for want of      a   better name.           To supply this

                                    450
desideratum    in nomenclature, and     as no such   fossil appears to have
                                                   '
been described or figured, we have named it Lyginodendron Land*-
          '
burgii ; forming the generic name from \vyivos, wicker-work, and
StvSpov, a tree ; and dedicating it by its specific name to its discoverer,
Mr Landsborough."       The fragments of the fossil were spread over
a space of about two yards, and have not been observed, except in
that place.    The finest specimen obtained was about 18 inches in
length, by 3 in breadth      It was discovered in the middle stratum.
    Of the genus Sigillaria there are two or three varieties, as Slgil-
laria oculata, Sigillaria reniformis, &c. &c.
    The most magnificent fossil found in the quarry is the Bothroden-
dron punetatum.       A splendid specimen of this fossil is in the pos
session  of Mr Landsborough,     which he describes to      be  of a size and
weight which he can scarcely     lift from the ground.       It is extremely
rare, however ;   only two, or at most    three, examples of    it have been
procured.
    Another very curious and remarkable fossil also, is the Stylolithen,
of which there appears to be two distinct varieties — one with very
broad stripes, the other with the lines more closely approximating,
and, likewise, more deeply indented.
    Specimens of all the before-mentioned fossils were contained in
the collection presented to the Society.       The author presented at the
same time some      masses of impure     ironstone, from a coal-pit on the
 same estate, containing  very beautiful specimens of the Unto          Urii.

    Scotland.     By J. S. Russell, Esq. (Abstract of this paper

2.   Additional Observations as to the Poisonous Properties of
               (Enanthe crocata.     By Dr Christison.
   In  this paper the Author added a few supplementary observations
to those made on the alleged poisonous properties of the (Enanthe
crocata, in his paper on the poisonous Umbellifene,     read on the 4th
December last.
   He   stated that he had met  with other cases of poisoning with this
plant, recorded by Continental authors, shewing that death may take
place in an hour, — that so small a quantity as a single tuber, no
                                                     A

                                   454
bigger than the finger, has proved fatal, — that the roots are poison
ous in some countries, from the beginning          of January till the
middle of October at all events, and probably throughout the whole
year   ; and that Spain may be added to the countries formerly men
tioned, where fatal effects have been produced by the plant.
    He next added, that he had recently tried on a dog the effects of
the juice of a pound of tubers, collected by Dr Pereira on the 16th
December from the locality at Woolwich ; and that no effect, or an
exceeding slight one only, was produced.
    It was farther observed, that, according to an analysis executed
in 1830 by MM. Pihan-Dufeilay and Cormerais, the activity of
the roots in French plants depends upon a resin . On proceeding to try
upon a rabbit the effects of the resin, obtained by their process from
the Woolwich plants, the author found that, when the resin from eight
ounces avoirdupois, amounting to 24 grains, was introduced in the
state of emulsion into the cellular tissue, the animal died in 78
minutes, after being affected with a remarkable combination of tetanic
spasm and convulsions : but that no effect whatever was produced
by the resinous extract from the same quantity of roots obtained
about the same season   of  the year (midwinter)    from the Dalmeny
oenanthe,   near Edinburgh,
   He concluded this notice with    an account of some experiments on
the chemical analysis of oenanthe,     observing  that he had failed to
obtain any principle from the Dalmeny       seeds or root, by a process
analogous to that by which conia is obtained from hemlock ; and
that the alcoholic extract of the Woolwich plants, distilled with solu
tion of potash, yielded, like hemlock, a little oleaginous-like   fluid,
which was too minute in quantity for him to ascertain its properties
accurately, but which on the whole seemed a volatile oil, and not an
alkaloid.

 L   On the Cellular Fibre and the Incrusting Matters of Plants.
    By Mr P. F. H. Fromberg.            Communicated by Professor
    Johnston.
    The results obtained    by the  author, on   analysing  the cellular

                                               455
fibre of different kinds of plants, after a sufficient                       purification,      are,
on the whole, in conformity with those of Payen.                             But   he considers
the formula, which Payen has derived from his results, an inconve
nient one  and that the composition of cellular fibre is in confor
              ;
mity with that of inuline, rather than with that of starch, as that
chemist has supposed.
     The author        observes    that he obtained, by treating different kinds
of     wood   in different        ways, a great many substances, of different
properties        and composition.             As to the composition, however, it
could almost always be represented by a formula, differing, more or
less, from that of ulmic acid, only by the number of equivalents of
hydrogen, that of the carbon and oxygen remaining the same.   The
composition of  the ulmic  acid   according to is,
                                               numerous  and accu
rate experiments of Professor Mulder, C40 H14 0U +    a greater or            ,
less number of equivalents of water, according to the temperature
at which the substances are dried, and the manner in which they
are obtained.
  Now, according to the analysis of several kinds of                                 wood,      and
especially of the more constant, hard perisperm of the                              stone fruits
analysed      by    M.    von    Baumhauer,          the following         formula       is   deter
mined    :—

        There remains                                                        C40 H23 0W
As the average formula of all kinds of incrusting matters, which
may be easily reduced to this              :   —
                                    C40   Hi7 0»     +   6H    0,
A    combination which differs from ulmic acid only by three equiva
lents of hydrogen.
   All the matters obtained and analysed by the author, could be
represented         by   formulae     from      C40 H22 012         to      0", all the
                                                                         C40 H14
others containing 20, 21, 19, etc.                   of hydrogen.      The last formula,
C40 H14 012 + water, which    at the same is                    time that of ulmic acid,
represented        a   substance    obtained after the action of strong reagents.

                                        456
 In all   these  experiments,     an   augmentation of carbon was accom
 panied    by a diminution     of hydrogen       ; but the proportion     of the
 change varied.
    According to      the author's   experiments, so far as they have gone,
 cellular fibre is not only soluble in alkalies, but also gradually
 changed by them into matters which approach, more and more, to
 the composition and properties of the ulmic acid.               The difference
 between    the action of alkalies and of acids consists in this      : that the
 states   of transition, namely dextrine and sugar, are not produced
by the action of the alkalies.        Cellular fibre and the incrusting mat
ters, when united in the substance of the plant, resist more power
fully the influence of chemical reagents, than when they are               sepa
rated from each other.        Payen's      idea, that  the incrusting matters
should be considered a3 consisting of           three substances, two of which
 are electro-negative, seems much too limited and artificial.
    The quantity of nitrogen found in these substances was much
too small to exercise any influence            on the composition.    It  is the
younger parts of growing         plants to which nitrogen is indispensable,
and in which it can always be found and demonstrated.
    Finally, it is not improbable that there exists          a whole series   of
incrusting matters, always present in their substance, for the use of
the different fluids and organs of plants : a purpose for which they
are eminently calculated, by their great facility of transformation,
and by their strong tendency to attract water.
    Were    we to assume the     transitory existence of ulmie acid in the
cells, we should probably         obtain wider ideas with regard to the
growth     and  decay   of plants.     It is well known, with respect to the
decay of vegetable matter, that a large quantity of hydrogen must
be set free during its decomposition, by means of which the forma
tion of ammonia in the soil is eminently favoured.
    In  the. converse process,     that   of growth,    precisely the opposite
process   — that  is, combination with hydrogen       — must   occur.   Growth
is thus     a reduction,   decay    an   oxidation.    The ulmic acid would
thus be, after tho formation       of the primary cell fibres, the common
source   of all the matters deposited in the cells, in all plants which
are rooted    in the ground.
    If  we agree to this     proposition,     then we do not require the de
composition of water to explain the growth of plants.                The large
quantity of pectine, C1J H8 010, which is present in some parts of
so many      plants,   and which     may be considered as       the incrusting
matter of the cells of carrots, turnips, different kinds of fruits, &c<

                                      457
together with other organic matters which contain much oxygen —
for instance, oxalic acid — may be the cause of the relative and
various abundance       of hydrogen in the products of ulmic acid —
namely, the incrusting matters of plants.
2. On a remarkable         Oscillation of the Sea observed at various
    places on the coasts of Great Britain, in the first week of
    July 1843. By David Milne, Esq.
    This phenomenon      was observed on the 5th        July and three follow
ing days.      It did not occur on all parts of the coasts of Great Bri
tain.     In  England, it was observed only on the south shores of
 Cornwall and Devonshire.         In   Scotland,    it  was  observed on the
east coast ; and there    it was seen at a great many places, between
 Eyemouth     in  Berwickshire  and the Shetland Islands.
    It  was only on the 5th    July  that the oscillation    occurred   on  the
 Cornish and Devonshire coasts.         It  prevailed on the Scottish coast,
 however, from the 5th to the 7th        July  inclusive.
    The phenomenon consisted of       a  flux and reflux of the    sea, beyond
 what could be accounted for by ordinary             tides, or any wind pre
 vailing at the time.      The water suddenly rose up and sunk down
 from 2 to 5 feet in perpendicular height, producing effects more or
 less striking, according to the shelving character of the shore.
     In regard   to the cause  of the phenomenon, various had         been the
 surmises   ; though the,general impression seemed to be, that it was
 produced by distant submarine earthquakes.
     The author stated that he could not acquiesce in this view, and
 gave his reasons    for saying so.
     In  order to obtain a wider field of induction, he referred to former
 instances of oceanic oscillations,    and shewed that they were almost
 always accompanied with considerable atmospheric disturbances.
     He then proceeded to give an account of a remarkable storm of
  wind, accompanied by thunder, lightning, and hail, which had tra
 versed the British Islands on the 5th July, appearing first in the
 SW. of England, and passing through the midland counties, tra
 versing the south-east parts of Scotland, and going off about the
 Aberdeenshire coast.
     By the lightning and large hail-stones accompanying this storm,
 much damage to property, as well as loss of life, had occurred.
 At Sheffield, the barometer was, during the passage of the storm,
 observed to sink suddenly about an inch.

                                          458
   The storm appeared         to have rotated, and in the usual way,            — viz.
 in a direction contrary to that of the hands of a watch, — of which
 proofs were given.
    The author then suggested, that the oscillations in question wero
 probably produced by this storm.     The parts of the coast where they
 were observed, coincided with the direction in which the storm moved.
The fact that the oscillations on the Cornish and Devonshire coasts
commenced before the storm arrived there, so far from being hostilo
to, supported this view ; for if waves were created by the storm, as
it approached Great Britain, these waves would advance more rapidly
than the storm, which appeared to move               northwards     at the rate of
from 70 to 80 miles per         hour, — whereas
                                      the similar waves produced
by the two Lisbon earthquakes had moved forward at a rate of from
120 to 130 miles per hour.
   As   to the way in which waves could             be produced on the surface
of the ocean, sufficient to produce the fluxes and refluxes in question,
it was observed   —
   (1.) That the wind, by its mere mechanical pressure,                was capable
of heaping up, over a large expanse, a considerable body of water.
By the force of the south or south-west blasts in the storm, the sea
would be elevated, and waves would thereby be formed, which would
move forward before the storm towards the south coast              of England.
   f2.) That the level of the         ocean rises   in proportion to the fall of
the barometer     ;   so that   if,   as there was    every reason to suppose,
this storm was accompanied in its track
                                                     by
                                                     a    diminution     of atmo
spherical   weight,   waves     almost commensurate        in extent with the
diameter of the storm would be formed.
  In  either or in both of these ways, the sea may have been,                    and
probably was, so affected on the 5th, 6th, and 7th July 1843,                   as to
produce the ebbing and flowing which was observed                 on certain parts
of the coasts of Great Britain.

The following communication was read : —
     On the Human Races in Britain, enumerated by Tacitus.
                    By Dr Hibbert Ware.
     This memoir had          been undertaken as preliminary               to an ethnologi
cal inquiry which the author had proposed                     to institute into the abori
gines of the British Islands.                  It was premised, that, in this endea
vour to seek for ancient races                  in those which were modern, great
caution is required.
     It                        if,
                        at the present day, we can as readily distin
          has been asked,
guish an Iberian type from one that    Gaulish or Caledonian, as was
                                                         is
done more than seventeen hundred years ago in the time of Tacitus                             1
It   is   answered, that,       by   a    conservative principle         in our nature,     di
rected to the persistency of types, the influences of Time, Climate,
and Civilization, are rendered of little avail.  And, even in   mix                 a
ture or crossing of races, there an interposition of preserving laws
                                               is
made in favour of mutually approximating types, such as those of
Europe. For instance, when two or more races are mingled together
in different proportions,   expected that the type of the minority
                                     it   is
will eventually     become          of the majority. But whether,
                                 merged in that
in accelerating or postponing such   result,   will be found that,
                                                         a          it
among all animals, nature exercises    sort of discretionary power
                                                          a
under three varied circumstances   1st, When races widely differ
                                                     :
from each other         ;   2d, When races are in             a   less degree remote   ;   and,

                                      460
 3d, When races,     like  those   of Britain, or Europe in general,        ap
proximate closely to each other.          These   three   circumstances     the
author discussed in succession.
    1st, When   races widely    differ from   each other, as in the crossing
of the horse and the     ass.    In   this case,  nature has ever declared,
that a debased or intermediate breed shall not be perpetuated.
    2d, When races are in a less degree remote. In this example
nature acts with uniformity, as in the crossing of the spaniel with the
greyhound, &c. ; and, among the human species, in the mixture of
European    and black races.        In  any one   of these instances, there
is no incapacity in the progeny to perpetuate its breed ; but it will
be found that the principle directed to the persistence of races gra
dually restores, in the course of a few generations, the purity of any
one of the types which may have been contaminated by mixture,
while the other type, in the meantime, is doomed to extinction.
    3d, When races approximate closely to each other, as when
spaniels (of which there are divers breeds), are crossed among them
selves, and the same of white and grey mice, the result shews that,
in the progeny, the types of a paternal or maternal            stock are less
liable to occur in an intermediate, than in a perfectly        distinct form   ;
or, in other words, that there is a less tendency to a         fusion than to
a separation of types.      For instance, in the Western        Highlands of
Scotland, which were peopled in succession by the dark-haired Gael,
and the flaxen-haired      Scandinavian, there is, in the descendants,
less a mixture than a separation of the types        ; the progeny of many
families  of the peasantry illustrating the        distinctness with which
Gaelic and Scandinavian characters are reproduced in              cases where
the paternal and maternal types differ from each other.
   In bringing forward these illustrations, it was far from being
argued that a progeny did not often exhibit an intermediate charac
ter, derived from the two     races of a paternal and maternal stock       ;  it
was simply urged that a separation         of types is equally, if not more
common ; and that, when a sort of intermediate character is ac
tually derived from two European races, it is not necessarily per
petuated to a future progeny.        On the contrary, a pure and distinct
type, even though rendered, for a generation or two, intermediate
and obscure, is often revived, with all its primitive decision of cha
racter.
   The author, lastly, availed himself of the occasion          to state, that

intermediate  likenesses, referred (often fancifully) to two types,
paternal and  maternal.
   From all these observations, it was concluded, that, although in
every society of mixed races the type of the minority had a tendency
to become merged, or to disappear in that of the majority, yet that,
by the interposition of relaxed laws, made in favour of the mixture of
two or more approximating races, such a result (in the absence of
exterminating wars, famine, or pestilence) may be postponed to an
incalculable period of time ; and, as an ultimate consequence, that
the discovery of ancient European races in those which                   are modern
is a reasonable expectation not likely to be frustrated.
     After these observations, the author           proceeded   to the   chief object
of the Memoir, which was to explain, on ethnological principles, the
ancient British races enumerated by Tacitus.   These were, 1st, the
Caledonians       —"   the red hair of those who inhabit Caledonia,                 and
their large limbs, bespeak a German               origin ;" 2d, the Gauls —
"    those who are nearest to           the Gauls are also similar to them ;"
and, 3d, the Iberians, indicated by their swarthy features and their
curled hair.
     The following exhibits a classification of the modern British              races
with which the author compared those                enumerated by Tacitus       ;   but
the description of them does not admit of abridgment.

and possibly a fourth, might be included.

  (a) The Teutonic race. To this race the description                       given of

and midland         districts   of England, but diminishes         in the northern

     Between the light-haired and dark-haired races of Europe consti
 tutional differences exist ; the former shewing the sanguine, and the
 latter the melancholic temperament.     In the female constitution the
diversity is still more apparent.  Under the dark-haired races are
included (a) the Cymric ; (b) the Gaulish ;   the Iberian. Tacitus

  1.  On the Existence of an Osseous Structure in the Vertebral
      Column of Cartilaginous Fishes.          By James Stark, M.D.,
      F.R.S.E.
     The author, after quoting from the works of writers on Ichthyology
 and Comparative Anatomy their descriptions of the vertebral columns
 of cartilaginous fishes, proceeded to point out the existence of an
 osseous structure in the vertebrae of the Plagiastomi, or Rays and
 Sharks.      In these animals the essential portion of each vertebra
 consists of a double cup or saucer-shaped osseous piece, resembling in
 form and structure the double cup-shaped vertebrae of osseous fishes,
 being, like them, composed of concentric rings of osseous matter.        It
 was shewn that the whole of the encrusting cartilaginous     matter,  with
 its calcareous granules, could be removed from this osseous structure,
 without affecting the integrity of the spinal column, or interfering with
 the intervertebral ligamentary apparatus which was alone attached to
 this osseous structure.     These double cup or saucer-shaped vertebra
 were in the Rays shewn to be perforated by an extremely minute
central aperture, which was, however, of a considerably larger size
in   a few genera of Sharks, as in the Dog-fish ; while in others, as in
the Saw-fish, no such aperture could be distinguished.
     These    double cup or saucer-shaped vertebrae receive various
strengthening columns, pillars, or plates of osseous matter, which
differ in structure and disposition in the several genera and       species
of cartilaginous fishes. In some, these plates were shewn to        have a
concentric arrangement, and to be separated from each other by plates
of cartilage.    In others, the plates were broad and fiat, and extended
only from the margin of the one cup to that of the other cup of the
same vertebra.       In others, the supports were compound and broad

                                     4G4
and had a somewhat radiated arrangement from the centre to the
circumference.      While in others, two of these modes were united in
strengthening the osseous cups.
    The peculiarities of  these double osseous cups, and   their supporting
columns, were pointed out in the vertebrae        of the Common Skate
(Raia batis), Thornback Ray (R. clavata), Sharp-nosed Ray (R.
oxyrhynchus), Starry Ray (R. radiata), Common Dog-fish (Scyllium
Catulus), Spotted Dog-fish (S. canicula), Picked Dog-fish (Spinax
acanthias), Common Tope (Galeus vulgaris), Basking Shark (Seiache
maximus),     White    Shark (Carcharias vulgaris), Saw-fish (Pristis
antiquorum),    and  Chimasra   (Chimaera monstrosa).
    The vertebral column of the Sturiones and Cyclostomi was shewn
to be essentially composed     of soft transparent cartilage.
    It was demonstrated by a chemical analysis of the essential osseous
portions of the vertebrae, that they were true bone.         This was   evi
denced by their containing the same        amount of earthy and animal
mattors, as the bones       of osseous fishes, as well as by their earthy
salts being of the same nature in both classes of bones.         The result
of the author's analysis gives, as a mean, about 69 per cent, of earthy
matters, chiefly consisting of phosphate of lime, and 31 per cent, of
cartilage.    The chemical composition of the common cartilaginous
skeleton, and of the vertebrae, with their encrusting cartilage and
calcareous granules, was also noticed, in order to shew the essential
difference between them and the truly osseous         portion   of the ver
tebrae.
    From   these peculiarities in the spinal column of the Plagiostomi
(Rays    and  Sharks), taken in connection with the higher degree of
development of their nervous, generative, and digestive systems, the
author concluded, that these fishes ought to form a new sub
class, and, in the descending scale of organization, be placed at the
 head of the fishes, as they manifestly form the connecting link be
 tween the osseous    fishes and the reptiles.    He  also concluded, that
 the Sturiones    and Cyclostomi     ought to be arranged together as a
 distinct subclass, to which the term of cartilaginous might still be re
 tained, and be placed after the osseous fishes, in the descending scale
 of natural classification  ; as the lower grade  of development of their
 whole systems, taken along with their essentially cartilaginous skele
 tons, constituted them the connecting link between the higher mol-
 lusca and the more imperfectly organized osseous fishes.
     The paper was concluded by pointing out the probable importance

                                      465
to the geologist   of  the discovery   of an osseous  structure in the ver
tebral columns of the Plagiostomi,       and one or two instances were re
ferred to in illustration of this part of the subject.

1 .   On the Development,    Structure, and Economy of the Ace-
         phalocysts of Authors ; with an Account of the Natural
         Analogies of the Entozoa in general.    By Harry D. S.
         Goodsir, Conservator of the Museum of the Royal Coll.
         Surg. Edin.   Communicated by John Goodsir, Esq.
      The Acephalocyst or Hydatid       is composed     of    a vesicle containing
fluid.       It
           propagates by means of internal gemmules, which are de
veloped between the layers of the membrane composing the vesicle,
and, after a certain time, are thrown off internally.
   The author, after pointing out these distinguishing characters of
the Hydatid, referred to the confusion which had arisen, from want
of proper observations on this point, and which, with other causes,
had been the reason why the animal               nature of these creatures had
been denied by some writers    of great authority.
      The author having procured a new form of Acephalocyst,              was en
abled, from his observations on its structure and economy, to deter
mine several important points relative to the anatomy, physiology,
and natural history of the other species of the class.
      He characterised this new     species of Acephalocyst        as a compound
animal, inasmuch as one continuous           membrane covered         a complete
group or mass of the Hydatids.      This membrane was described as
consisting almost entirely of tubuli, ramifying freely through     and      it,
a number of ovoid disks scattered at short intervals over its  surface,
the edges of which were lined with minute open stomata, which
opened into the tubuli.   The author looked upon these tubuli and
stomata as the organs of nutrition.
   Another membrane lay immediately                 beneath that already          de
scribed, and covered each Hydatid in particular.                The body of the
Hydatid itself     consisted   entirely of   a   homogeneous    mass of gelatine,
intersected by     a number of very delicate septa.
      The author    now described the mode of propagation,              which     he
stated     was analogous to that    of the polyps, in    so   far, that, 1st, there
was    a     number of ova thrown                      of the parent
                                       off for the extension
group    and, 2d, another generation for the extension of the species
         ;
generally.   These ovules arose from the internal surface of the ex

                                   467
ternal tubular membrane, and consisted of a parent cell, containing
young ones within it.
    The author here directed attention particularly to the mode of
growth in this and the simple Acephalocyst, as compared with that
of the next known animal in the class, viz., the Caenurus. He stated,
that, in the first (Hydatid), one cell was thrown off from the internal
surface of the vesicle, which increased in size by simple dilatation,
without any cellular development whatever.        The growth of the new
form of Acephalocyst      was   exactly similar, — with this difference,
that originally there was a parent cell which formed a number of
young cells within it, each of which afterwards became the separate
individual, by simple dilatation also.
    The author, after describing the adult Caenurus, then proceeded
to state the observations he had made on its development from          the
ovule upwards.       He stated, that the ovule, when observed within
the body of the parent animal, was composed, first, of a germinal
spot within a germinal vesicle, and which was enclosed in a yolk of
very considerable size.     The yolk, again, was surrounded by a very
thin layer of albumen, defended by the shell or external covering.*
After the ovum    escaped from the parent, the germinal spot increased
very much in size, and a small clear spot appeared in its centre.
    During the third stage, the germinal spot had increased consider
ably in size, and had become      nodulated ; the central spot   had also
increased in size.
    During the fourth stage, the nodules had     become   separate cells,
surrounding a central cell, which had also a germinal spot within it.
This again underwent similar changes, and was succeeded in turn
by other crops of cells in like succession.      This formation of cells,
from a succession    of centres, only extended the growth in     a lateral
direction,  the author   therefore named this the discoidal period       of
growth, which again he subdivided into minor stages.
    After describing all the stages of discoidal development, he pro
ceeded to point out a change that took place in the mode      of develop
ment of the cells, and which, according to the direction of growth, he
named   the vertical period of growth.
   During the discoidal period of development, all the cells were pro
duced from one series or succession of centres ; but during the ver
tical period, instead of one, there were several, each of which form

to those of the higher animals.

                                   468
young cells.     The excentric cells of this period were all productive,
and so, able  to form new centres.      The number of centres, however,
were always limited,    owing to the liquefaction and absorption of nu
merous   peripheral cells.
   The   author,  in the concluding part of his paper, stated, that dur
ing  his  observations,  he was led to perceive the existence of many
beautiful analogies between the Entozoa and the species belonging
to other classes of the animal kingdom.
   The volvox among the infusoria, he considered as the analogue of
the Hydatid, and illustrated this by examining their economy com
paratively.
   The Alcyonidium      among the Polyps, is the analogue of the new
form of Acephalocyst.        Ova in both cases being developed, 1st,
for the purpose of increasing the bulk of the parent group; and,
2d,   for the purpose of being distributed generally, to form se
parate and independent groups.         In the function of nutrition the
analogy also held true, inasmuch as each of the stomata or disks, it
may be, supplied nourishment to the whole group, as well as to its
own particular part ; in the Alcyonidium, each polype acts as a mouth
for the group.
   Proceeding upwards in the scale, the author looks upon Diplozoon
as the analogue of the Asterias, Tristoma, as that of Scutella and Dis-
toma, that of Echinus ; and brought forward an interesting observa
tion, which he thought decisive as to the propriety of the analogies
drawn between these Entozoa and Echinodermata, namely, that as
the Echinus    is merely an Asterias, with the rays folded back, so as
to meet at the tips and form a globe, so is the Distoma merely a
Diplozoon, with the two bodies folded together.
   The Acanthocephala, of which the Echinorynchi are the types,
are analogues   of the Crustacea, through the  Lerneae.  The Ccelelmin-
tha, of which the Lumbricoides      are the types, are analogous to the
Annelida through the Lumbrici.
2. Account of a Repetition of Dr Samuel Brown's Processes for
   the Conversion of Carbon into Silicon. By George Wilson,
   M.D., Lecturer on Chemistry ; and John Crombie Brown,
   Esq.     Communicated by the Secretary.
   The authors    commenced    with an account  of the trials they made
with the Cyanide of lead ;      which, according to Dr Brown's     most
recent announcement, is resolved by his process into gaseous nitrogen

                                         469
and silicon.      In  the first place,    however, they could not succeed in
obtaining a pure cyanide of that metal.              For whether they decom
posed the cyanide of potassium, or the hydrocyanate of ammonia con
taining an excess of hydrocyanic acid, by neutral acetate of lead, by
this salt acidulated with         acetic   acid, or by tribasic acetate, they
constantly obtained a compound containing                a large   quantity of a
hydrated basic acetate        of lead   ;  and they were not more success
ful when they substituted other salts of            lead   for the acetate as a
precipitant,     such as     the nitrate,    basic   nitrate, nitrite, chloride,
or iodide.      It  was impossible,       therefore, to obtain atomic results
with the cyanide of lead.          But several of the precipitates, obtained
in the ways now mentioned, were subjected nevertheless to Dr
Brown's process,       and there was obtained a brown          substance,  which
they expected to prove to be silicon.             When fused, however, with
carbonate of potash, instead of yielding more than twice its weight
of silica, it gave only     a tenth  of its weight of a yellowish-white sub
stance,  which was not examined with any particular care, but which
seemed    to correspond with silica in its leading properties.
    The Cyanides of copper and zinc were also rejected after adequate
trials ; and recourse was then had to the Cyanide of silver, which, it
is well known, may be readily obtained pure and definite in com
position.      When similarly treated as in the process with cyanide of
lead, it was converted by heat into a brown powder, with the loss
of only a 400th of its weight ; and when this was fused with car
bonate of potash, there was obtained from the product a notable
quantity of a substance corresponding in properties with silica, but
still much inferior in quantity to what ought to have             been obtained,
 had the whole carbon of the cyanide become silicon.
    The authors next mentioned the results they obtained with the
Ferrocyanides.        The Ferrocyanide of potassium, when heated with
carbonate of potash at a white heat, according to Dr Brown's earlier
process, yielded them a saline mass, in which, in many trials, they
could obtain only traces of a substance corresponding with silica in
properties.       Ferrocyanide     of lead also yielded traces ; Prussian
blue none    ;  Ferrocyanide     of copper rather more than the similar
salt of lead.
    They then turned to Paracyanogen, which they treated repeatedly
 by  Dr Brown's method of fusion with carbonate of potash. They
were foiled, however, in obtaining his results.               Paracyanogen ob
tained from cyanide of mercury, and purified by boiling it first with
water, and then with solution of carbonate of potash, gave off, not
          B

                                        470
nitrogen only, as Dr Brown has stated, but also carbonic acid and
carbonic oxide ; and the residue contained carbon.              The authors,
however, obtained some silica in the greater number of cases ;
occasionally     none, even from     paracyanogen prepared by Dr Brown
himself     ; frequently very little  ; and never nearly the quantity which
ought to have been obtained had the whole carbon become                silicon,
but fifteen per cent, at the utmost.
    They also varied the process with Paracyanogen, by heating it
alone for three days over an argand gas-flame in a malleable-iron
crucible, luted and coated with stucco.           A nut-brown powder, weigh
ing 4.2 grains, was thus obtained from 18.5 grains of Paracyanogen.
When 3.9 grains of this were fused with carbonate of potash, and
the product treated as if it contained silicate of potash, the authors
obtained 8.4 grains of a substance undistinguishable by any charac
ters from silica.        Had the brown powder been silicon, the product
in this form should have been 8.11 grains.               This experiment was
twice repeated unsuccessfully.
    The authors believe the substance             obtained  on this and other
occasions     to have been   silica  on the following grounds.       It was a
white, gritty powder, unalterable by ebullition in aqua regia for
hours, or by exposure to a white heat, or to the full blow-pipe blast ;
fusible     into a glass bead with carbonate of soda before the blow
pipe ;   soluble with effervescence in fused alkaline carbonates, and
recoverable from the product without any change of property ; con
vertible, when heated with potassium, into a substance undistinguish
able   from silicon    ;  and yielding   fluo-silicic  acid when heated    with
fluor-spar and sulphuric acid.
    In  conclusion, they deny that it is possible to ascribe the appear
ance of the silicon and silica in these experiments either to impurity
of the re-agents employed, or to action upon the vessels constituting
the apparatus.       They consider, therefore, that silicon was produced
in an anomalous manner ; but they do not admit that it is proved to
have come from the carbon ; for it might have been derived as well
from the nitrogen, or from both elements together. And they state,
that they abandoned the farther trial of Dr Brown's processes, be
cause they became satisfied, that his experiments cannot be repeated
at will   ;   and that the conditions essential to success have not been
ascertained, nor the details of the processes sufficiently      worked out, to
afford the means of establishing the transmutability           of carbon into
silicon on quantitative grounds.

     The following communication was read —                    :   ,
1.   Inquiry into the Aborigines of the British Islands. Part 2.
     On the claims of the Cymric and Gaelic races to be thus
     considered.   By Dr S. Hibbert Ware.
     In   the first part of the present memoir,           it   was shewn that Caesar
divided  Gaul into three parts, of which one was inhabited by the
Belgre, another by those who, in their own language, were called
Celtae, but who, by the Romans, were named Gauls, and     third by             a
the Aquitani.     These three nations, according to the Roman his
torian, differed from each other in language, custom, and laws but                  ;
it was remarked by tho author, that they also differed from each
other in physical characters,            — the    Belgfc possessing     what   is   named
a Cymric type, the Gauls proper a Gaulish type, and the Aquitani
an Iberian type.  All these three races were to be distinguished
from the zanthous,    light-haired, Germanic tribes of the West of
Europe, not only by the dark colour of the hair and eyes, but by
other particulars, as the form of the head, &c.
     The present memoir   was confined to (1st), the Cymric race, and
(2dly),  the Gaelic race.
   (1st), The Cymric race. — The physiological distinction of Cymri
and Gaelic races was first established by the late Dr VV. F. Edwards,

                                      472
in his memoir " Des Caracteres Physiologiques des Races d'Humain."
The Cymric head is long, and often failing in width.            The forehead
is large and high ; the      nose  curved,  with  the   extremity depressed,
and the nasal ailes raised or turned       up ; the chin strongly marked
and prominent,       and the stature tall.   It was also explained by the
author that these physical characters were associated          with a distinct
moral type.
     It was argued,    in the present memoir,      that the Cymri had no
real pretensions whatever to consider themselves (as in the ancient
British triads) a primitive race in Britain.          In tracing their pro
gress from their oriental sojourning place       to  the   remote west, they
 appear to have taken possession      of no ground    in any part of Europe
which     had not been    preoccupied by other races.        The author, in
the course of arriving at this conclusion, gave the following historical
account of the Cymri.
     Sogdiana and Bactriana appear to have been the cradle of this
race.      At the present day, the Cymric type may be identified
among the wandering tribes of Beloochistan, of which the author
had evidence in some very accurate drawings,           executed for him by
his late   son, during the expedition    of Lord Kean.
     The  course  of Cymric migration     from east to west, was inferred
by the occasional light which history affords of the physical cha
racters of this early race, aided also by philological tests.             The
 Cymric type     is to be detected   among some of the tribes anciently
dwelling     between   the Caspian    and Euxine       seas,  and in certain-
 Egyptian sculptures, as figured by Bosallini, of the Feccaro (named
 by Wilkinson, Tokkarf) dwelling, in the time of Bameses the Third,
 not far from      the eastern shores of the Mediterranean.           Various-
 kinds of evidence also demonstrate, that the Cymri are to be traced,
 during their westerly migration, in Persia, along the shores of the
 Black Sea, in Greece, in Italy, and in the tracts watered by the
Danube and the Rhine.              They again appear as confederated
 tribes, known by tho appellation of Boii, and Belgae.             Under the
 name of Firbolgs (Viri Bolgae), they peopled Ireland, and, in occupy
 ing England and Scotland, they were lastly driven, by Saxon inroads,
 to the mountainous recesses of Wales.       Various details of the greater
 or less prevalence of the Cymric type,       as it is to be traced in these
 different countries, were supplied by the author.
     (2dly), The Gaulish, or Gaelic race. — According to Dr Edwards,
 the head is round, so- as to approach in a manner to a spherical
 form   ; the forehead is moderate, a little swelled out, and retreating

                                       473
towards the temples ; the eyes are large and open ; tne nose, in
tracing it from the depression at its origin, is nearly straight, or
without any marked curvature, and rounded at the extremity ; the
chin is also rounded.      Lastly, the height is moderate ; which, as
Thierry, in his Histoire des Gaulois, first shewed, is an important
historical distinction : for whenever the Romans spoke of the gigantic
height of the Gauls, they meant their Cymric, and not their Gaelic
foes.   It was also explained that the moral type of the Gauls
differed much from that of the Cymric race.
   In  considering the claims of the Gaelic race to be ranked as
aboriginal in Britain, the author entered upon two questions, (a)
their original sojourning place, and (6) their course of migration.
                                                 —
   (a) The Asiatic cradle of the Gaelic race. The author, after
noticing the suspicion of Baron Larrey, that Arabia was to be thus
considered, as well as the various opinions on this subject, advanced
by Vallancey, Dr O'Conor, Sir William Betham, and others, was
inclined    to believe that     the primitive     Gauls   were a polished and
civilized   people,    originally dwelling on the eastern coast of the
Mediterranean,        who, as maritime adventurers, visited the west of
Europe on objects of traffic, particularly for the sake of the precious
metals.  He did not consider it as necessary to this opinion, that
they should be identified with the Phoenicians, or any other nation
equally maritime       ;   but left this question to be determined by more
satisfactory evidence than has hitherto been adduced,           resulting from
a comparison  of physical characters. It           was also observed, that the
leading physical characters of the Gael, namely, the form of the
head and features, appear in the figures of certain sculptured
monuments       of the very early period of Rameses the Third, which,
from a discordancy          in other respects,      have greatly puzzled both
Champollion,      and Rosallini.      These      figures of a civilized people,
richly attired, are referred to inhabitants of Canaan or its confines.
    (6)The course of Gaelic migration to the West.— The author was
disposed to consider, that evidence of the westerly course of Gaelic
migration might probably be found in the commercial settlements
which early maritime tribes may have formed on the Mediterranean
coasts    and islands.       He, accordingly,     adverted to the remark     of
Baron Larrey, relative to the identity of the western Arabs with
Gaulish races, — to the assertion of Gesenius, that the Numidian
language was a pure, or very nearly pure, Hebrew, such as was
spoken by the ancient Canaanites or Phoenicians, — and to various
Cyclopean structures in Malta, on the African coast, and elsewhere,

                                     474
similar to those which characterise the westerly countries of the
Gael.     But the author dwelt most upon the account of the Tur-
ditani of Spain, as given by Pliny, to whom an early introduction of
letters was ascribed, together with the use of valuable works of art
wrought in the precious metals, resembling such as are constantly
discovered in Ireland, which indicate the very early state of civil
ization in this country.       The author then entered into a detailed
description, from personal observation, of the greater or less fre
quency of the Gaelic type in France, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales ;
and of the causes to which its disappearance in many extensive dis
tricts might have been attributable.
    After these explanations, the general question was considered, —
What    race ought to be regarded as aboriginal    in the British islands  ?
Llwyd had long since shewn, from the language of topography, that
the Gauls had preceded the Cymri in the occupation of Britain. But
it was asked,   — if there  might not have been a still earlier race exist
ing in this country than the maritime and commercial Gauls ?
    To this question an answer was given in the affirmative.          Taci
tus, in his enumeration of British races, has suggested, that an an
cient Iberian stock, remarkable for a swarthy complexion and curled
hair, might have passed over and occupied the seat of the Silures (in
 South Wales) ; — a British tribe, with whom he was disposed to iden
tify this primitive race of Spain.
    It was   then stated, that tho author had collected abundant evi
dence which leads      to the conclusion, that an Iberian, or Aquitanian
race, was an older one in Britain than either of the two whose pre
tensions he had discussed     ; but that it would be in vain to establish
their aboriginal claims, unless the history of the Cymri and the
Gael, in reference not only to their Asiatic sojourning place, but also
to their westerly course      of migration,  was  well understood.     He,
lastly, expressed his hope, that, if the aboriginal claims of the Ibe
rian race meet with confirmation, some light would be thrown upon
the fossil bones of the human species which are found in caves, or
buried deep in strata of peat, occasionally associated with the remains
of animals now extinct, which have had an existence prior even to the
records   of history.

The following communications were read          : —
1.  On the Conversion of Relief by Inverted Vision.              By Sir
                        David Brewster, K.H.
2.  On the Geology of Cockburn-Law and its Neighbourhood.
     By William Stevenson, Dunse. Communicated by David
     Milne, Esq.
   The author, in the first part of his paper, described the nature of
the formations, and in the last part offered his views in explanation
of the appearances.
   In describing the formations, he enumerated, first, those of aqueous,
and last those of ligneous origin.
   I.  The former consist of the greywacke, the old red sandstone,
and the coal-measure formations.

                                       476
                                                   Cockburn-Law,
   (1.) The greywacke strata form tho summit of
having a strike about NE. and SW. nearly vertical.  There appears
to be no decided evidence    of any organic remains in             these strata ;   —
there aro curious markings which are most probably only concretion
ary.   At Hoardwheel, situated to the eastward of Cockburn-Law,
two varieties of copper ore are found in the greywacke, the green
and the grey, the former of which is the most plentiful, and imparts
a beautiful hue to the rocks.         The oxide of manganese          is also widely
diffused.
   (2.) The old red sandstone strata lie over the upturned                  edges   of
the greywacke, and have therefore been deposited at a more recent
epoch.  At a distance from the hills they are generally horizontal,
or dip away at a gentle angle ; — but at the sides of the hills they
are highly inclined, — a circumstance probably caused by an upheaval
of the hills, which took place after the date of this formation. These
old red sandstones are extensively developed in Preston Haugh.     The
lowest bed consists of pebbles or fragments of rocks, both angular
and rounded, derived from the wearing        down of the greywacke and
porphyritic  rocks.   The  colour of this formation is, especially towards
its base, of a red colour.
   It
    is in this formation, that the bones, teeth, scales, and spines of
the Holoptichius nobilissimus, a large ganoid fish, described by
Agassiz, were found by the author in          1   840.      These are remains of
the same kind of fish which have been found in Perthshire, England,
Russia, and in other parts of the globe, and which abounded at the
epoch of the old red sandstone formation ;       for wherever it is found,
these particular rocks prevail.        The nature of the strata in which it
is found —a coarse,     gritty   sandstone   — seems        to   indicate   that the
Holoptichius swam about in waters near the shore                 ; another proof of
which   is afforded by the ripple marks on the sandstone slabs near
their place of sepulture.   These interesting relics are very abundant
in the strata opposite to Cockburn Mill, and also about half a mile
below     on the right bank of the Whitadder.
        it,
   (3.) The coal-measure strata lie          above        the old red sandstone
rocks, but are not disconformable         to them in dip.
                                                    They are to be
seen  in the Whitadder,  below Preston Bridge,  and  consist of the
ordinary sandstones, shales, and strata of ironstone.    The only
fossils prevailing   in them are those of terrestrial            vegetables, which
probably had been drifted        by
                              rivers.
   II. The Igneous rocks  were divided            by   the author into two classes
—one of which        he described as the      Felspathic, tho other           as    the
 Augitic.

                                       477
     (1.) The Felspathic rocks comprehend all those igneous rocks
associated with the greywacke strata, consisting of the granites,
and     syenites, and      old porphyries    of Cockburn- Law, the Stane-
shiel, the     Knock Hill,     Blackcrstone Hill, &c.         The central parts
 of these igneous masses present the most crystalline appearance,
consisting there of pyramidal and wedge-shaped blocks.                     In those
parts     approaching to and in contact with the greywacke strata,
a rhomboidal parallelopiped structure prevails, — which also charac
terises the aqueous       rocks when in contact with the igneous.              It is
interesting    to  notice the  effect produced    on  the  greywacko     strata, by
the outhurst through and among them of these igneous rocks. Where
the two kinds of rocks are immediately in contact, all signs of stra
tification in the greywacke have been obliterated; and, indeed, these
strata appear to have been metamorphosed into syenite.
     (2.) The Augidc trap-rocks exist almost entirely among the
more recent aqueous rocks, viz. the old red sandstones                   and coal-
measures.        They are seldom or never seen within the range of the
greywacke      formation,   at least in this neighbourhood.
    These augitic traps exist both in the form of narrow dykes, and in
that of great masses constituting         hills.    Of  the former,     the Cum-
ledge trap-dyke is a good example.            It  is seen in the bed of Oxen-
dean    Burn at Cumledge        House,   and there forms         in amygdaloidal
greenstone, abounding in veins of zeolite, steatite, and other mine
rals.     The width of the dyke at this place is about ten yards.               The
average     direction of the dyke is    NN.W.      and  SS.E.      It  has had the
effect, as usual,     of hardening tho strata    on each side   of it.   This dyke
has been traced by the author         for a considerable      distance,     running
through both the old red sandstone and coal-measure formations.
It appears also to reach into the granite of the Staneshiel and Cock-
burn-Law.
     An overflow of amygdaloidal trap is to be seen on the left bank
of tho Whitadder, below Cockburn Mill, forming a bed of about four
feet thick, and     lying  above the old red sandstone strata.          There are
large accumulations of greenstone at Borthwick and Castle Mains.
Dunse-Law is also composed of basalt.
    In   the second part of his paper,       the author shewed that the out
burst of the granite and other felspathic rocks had taken place simul
taneously with the upsetting of the greywacke formation, and beforo
the deposition of the old red sandstones.           He   also stated, that when,
after the deposition of tho coal-measures, a new outhurst of igneous
rocks took place, the Lammermuir chain probably received an ad

                                    478
ditional upheave, — as the considerable dip of the old red sandstone
from that chain could not otherwise be very            well accounted for.
The colour of the old red sandstones ho attributed to the wearing
down of the greywacke and porphyritic rocks of a red colour.             The
reason why the outhurst of the porphyritic rocks took place before
tho augitic traps, he supposed might be the smaller specific gravity of
the former.
    Mr   Stevenson's paper was illustrated       by a geological     map, as
 well as by numerous sections.
 3.   Notice regarding The Indian Grass Oil, or Oil of Andropo-
     gon Calamus-aromaticus.          By Thomas G. Tilley, Phil. D.
     Communicated by Dr Christison.
     The oil known       as Indian Grass    Oil, has   been   referred by Dr
 Royle   to the Andropogon     Calamus-aromaticus,    a plant which he con
 ceives to be identical with    the KccXapoi agu/utrixoi of the Greeks.
 It  has been used   in medicine as a stimulant embrocation in rheuma
 tism, &c.
     The oil, which   was green,   became    yellow when     heated.   It ac
 quired a steady boiling point at 440°, between which temperature
 and 442°, a transparent colourless oil distil over.        This, after recti
 fication by chloride of calcium, was analysed, and found to have the
 following composition.
                  Found.              Atoms.           Calculated.
            Carbon      88.10            10              88.46.
            Hydrogen 11.29               16              11.54.
  from which data, it appears that the oil of grass contains, and chiefly
  consists of a carbo-hydrogen,    in which the proportion of the carbon
  is to tho hydrogen, as 10 to 16, as in the case of oil of turpentine,
  and other volatile oils of the same class.
