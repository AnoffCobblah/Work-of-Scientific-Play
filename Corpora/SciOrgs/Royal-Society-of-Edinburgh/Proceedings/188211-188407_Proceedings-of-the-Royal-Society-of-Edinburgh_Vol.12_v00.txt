2                      Proceedings         of the  Royal Society
                         Monday, 4th          December     1882.
        The Eight Hon. LORD MONCREIFF,                                President,
                                       in the Chair.
      The President gave a short historical sketch of the Society on the
 occasion    of the commencement             of its Hundredth       Session.    He said
 that, before the business commenced,                he ought to call attention to a
 peculiarity of the present meeting,              and to make one or two observa
 tions upon it.        This  was the hundredth session of the Royal Society.
 Most cordially did         he congratulate the Society and its members                on
 having arrived at that interesting period of its history.                    But it was
  right   he   should say that it would bo a mistake to suppose                     that,
 although      this was the hundredth                session,   they were absolutely
  centenarian.        This    was     not the anniversary of the birth of the
  Royal Society.         For  some reason or other — he did not know how —
  the   hundredth       session    began     before   the Society was absolutely a
  hundred years old.            How it exactly         came about he was not quite
  sure.    The Royal        Society's charter bore date March 1783; and he
   supposed,    like other     great institutions,       they had   a  previous autumn
   session — and in that way, possibly, the            difference  was to be accounted
   for.   But, in any view, it           is a great     occasion   for meditation and
   observation, and there may come a time for such a word, but on the
   present   occasion     he had not the          material sufficient to do anything
   like justice     to a theme        so  large.    Only in    a few sentences     would
   he go back to March 1783, and glance upon the long career                       which
   the Society had run.            A   long and distinguished        course, he thought
   they might say, seeing it was to their distinguished                      predecessors
   they owed its glory and its present                 flourishing   existence.     There
    had been many speculations as to where                    the Royal    Society came
    from, and its feeders had been examined and searched for with great
    assiduity.     There was       a  Rankinian Club in Edinburgh towards the
    beginning of last century, and it was claimed as the foundation of
    the Royal      Society.     Then there        was a Select Society, a debating
    club — somewhere about             1750 — where Dr Robertson and the             great
    men   of those      days practised         the   oratory which      they afterwards
    used with     such   effect  ;   and   they had been told that that to         a largo

                          of Edinburgh,        Session 1882-83.                               3
extent was the  origin of the Royal Society. He had looked into
the Appendix to Dugald Stewart's
                                   Life of Robertson, and there he
found a list of members of the Select Society — and it contained
many,      if not all, of the       names of the great men who were in 1783
among      its members.           One distinctive      thing    he could gather from
the notice        was, that Adam            Smith and David Hume             were       both
members      of   it,   and that neither      one nor the other ever opened their
lips in the Society during the time they were members of it.                             But
he rather     thought       a   third institution had     more claim, and that was
the     Philosophical Society, fonnded by Colin Maclaurin, the                          great
mathematician.            Undoubtedly       it    did survive till the period when
the   Royal Society        was formed.         Colin Maclaurin, unfortunately for
himself, was        the engineer employed to defend Edinburgh                       at tho
time of the advance of the Pretender in 1745, and he had to leave
Edinburgh.          Observations         had sometimes        been   made    as    if   Mac
laurin had made     somewhat precipitate retreat on that occasion,
                          a
but the real fact was, he was the last man who left, for he found,
after all the fortifications were complete,              that there was nobody to
man     them, and no army to help in the defence.                     He    was not tho
only man who. had to retreat, for he rather thought the Court of
Session also took that course, and before the Pretender arrived
the  Judges had departed to their country seats. Such was the
parentage of the Royal Society. In 1783 these streams all seemed
to meet, and this institution              was the result.     They had originally         a
literary    side and       a    physical    or mathematical side.           At the first
start    they had       104 on the physical          side and 114 members on the
literary    side.       He was looking back           to an address     by his much
valued and lamented friend Professor Forbes, which was delivered
in 1862, and he would go over                 a   few names given there       as   belong
ing to the physical side and to the literary side, and they would
probably agree with him (there were many more who might go
alongside of them) that would be difficult to find in any part of
                                   it
Britain, or in any country out of Britain, an assemblage of persons
more distinguished in their respective spheres.    The physical side
embraced      Joseph Black, Clerk of                 Eldin,     Lord Hailes,        James
Gregory,     James Hutton,              John Play fair, Dugald
                                                           Stewart, Lord
Bute,    Lord Dundonald,            Sir James Hall, James Watt, Dr Small
(Dundee), and Patrick Wilson.                 And on the literary side       there were

4                   Proceedings     of tlw Royal Society
the Lord President, Chief Baron, the Lord Advocate,                 John Home,
David Hume, Henry Mackenzie, Alexander                   Tytler,   the Duke of
Buccleuch,     Archibald Alison, Dr Beattie, Edmund Burke,                  Lord
Morton,     Lord Hopetoun,        John Hunter, Thomas Reid, Young of
Glasgow, and       Mr Liston.      That was    a  nucleus for   a great Society   ;
and certainly from that time forward             it grew and     prospered  until
the position of a Fellow of the Eoyal Society of Edinburgh became
one of the highest distinction.           Now, it    appeared, they had lasted
for one hundred years.           Whether they all of them could         come up
to the mark of the great men whose names he had read he did not
know.      For  one thing, we knew many things they              did not know,
although they possibly knew a great many that we did not know                     ;
but, looking     back from 1783        till now, it    was a wonderful      retro
spect   in point of knowledge and invention and                progress — owing,
to a largo    extent, to the labours of the men whose names he had
just mentioned.      The literary side was presided over by Sir Thomas
Miller of Barskimming, who held             the office of  Lord Justice-Clerk,
the office the speaker       had the honour to hold.           He  was a man of
very great powers — a great lawyer, and a man of very strong lite
 rary tastes.    But  he   did not know that the literary         side had quite
 made    the progress   tliey might have looked for during that time.
 It  did last for about twenty years in great vigour.                He had the
 curiosity to  see  what the subjects were that were treated of.            There
 were   some   very vigorous papers; and among               them he     found a
 dissertation by John       Maclaurin, the son of the mathematician, the
 object of which      was    to  prove that Troy was          not taken by the
 Greeks after all, which        he tried to prove with a wonderful amount
 of learning.      Perhaps he might be excused            if  he suggested    that
 possibly it would be an improvement               if in this  respect  also they
 followed    more closely in the footsteps of their predecessors.           These
 observations he concluded by wishing the Eoyal Society all pro
 sperity in the next hundred years.

    1.  On the Laws of Motion.               Part L     By Professor Tait.
                                    (Abstract.)
    The substance of part at least of this paper was given in 1876
as an evening       lecture to the British Association           at its Glasgow
meeting.
    While   engaged     in writing the article " Mechanics " for the Ency.
Brit,   I  had to consider carefully what basis to adopt, and decided
that the time had not yet come in which (at least in a semi-popular
article) Newton's laws of motion could be modified.                   The article
was therefore based entirely on these laws, with a mere hint towards
the end that in all probability they would               soon require essential
modification.      It  is well, however, that the question of modification
should    now    be    considered    ;  and    this should    be done, not   in  a
popular essay but, before a scientific society.
    The one objection to which, in modern times, that wonderfully
complete     and compact        system is liable,      is that   it is expressly
founded on the conception of what is now called " force " as an
agent which
                " compels" a change of the state of rest or motion of

                      of Edinburgh,      Session 1882-83.                         0
a body.       This is part of the first law, and the second law is merely
a definite     statement of the amount of change produced by a given
force.
    (Next comes a digression as to what was Newton's expression for
 what we now mean by the word force, when it is used in the correct
signification above.)
    There can be no doubt that the proper use of the term force in
 modem science is that which is implied in the statement — Force is
 whatever changes a body's state of rest or motion.                This is part of
 the first law of motion.          Thus we      see that force is the      English
equivalent of Newton's term vis impressa.                But it is also manifest
 that, on many occasions,        but only where    his meaning admitted of no
 doubt, Newton omitted the word impressa and used vis alone, in
 the proper sense of force.           In   other cases he omitted        the word
 impressa, as being implied         in  some other adjective        such as centri-
peta, gravitans,      &c, which he employed           to  qualify the word     vis.
 Thus (Lemma X.) he says :— Spatia, quce corpus urgente qudcunque
vi finitd describit, &c. It is needless to multiply examples. But
 that this is the true     state  of the  case is made absolutely certain by
 the following: —
    Definitio    IV.   Vis impressa     est  actio in corpus exercita, ad mu-
tandum       ejus statum     vel   quiescendi    vel  movendi uniformiter        in
directum.
    Contrast this with the various           senses  in which the word vis is
used in the comment which immediately follows, viz. : —
    Constitit    haec  vis in actione    sola, neque post actionem permanct
in corpora.       Perseverat enim corpus       in statu omni novo per solam
vim    inertiae.    Est autem vis impressa diversarum origin um, ut ex
ictu, ex pressione, ex vi centripetal
    These passages are translated by Motte as below             : —
    "
      Definition IV. An impressed force is an action exerted upon a
body, in order to change its state, either of rest, or of moving uni
formly forward in, a right line."
    " This force consists in the action only, and remains no
                                                                         longer in
the body when the action is over.             For a body maintains every new
state   it acquires, by its vis inertim only.          Impressed forces are of
different origins    ; as from percussion, from pressure,         from centripetal
force."

 10                    Proceedings    of the Royal       Society
     The difficulty which Motte here makes for himself, and which he
 escapes     from only hy leaving part of the passage                in the original
 Latin, is introduced solely by his        use of the word force as the equi
 valent of the Latin vis.
     If    we paraphrase      the passage      as   follows,   with attention      to
 Newton's obvious meaning, this difficulty disappears, or rather does
 not occur     : —
     " This kind of vis consists in," &c. For the " body continues
 ....      by the vis of inertia," &c However, we may quote two other
 passages     of Newton bearing definitely on this point.
     Definitio III. Material ins intita est potentia resistendi, qua
 corpus unumquodque, quantum in se est, perteverat in statu suo vel
 quiescendi vel movendi uniformiter in directum.
    It   is perfectly clear that, in this passage, the phrase vis insita is
 one idea, not two, and that vis cannot here be translated                 by force.
 Yet Motte has
    " The vis insita, or innate force of matter, is,"          <fec.
    Definitio V.       Vis centripeta     est,  qua corpora        versus  pnnctum
 aliquod, tanquam ad centrum, undique traliuntur, impelluniur, rel
iitcumque tendunt.
    It  is obvious that the qualifying term centripeta here includes the
idea suggested by impressa, defining           in fact the direction of the vis,
and therefore implying that its origin is outside the body.
    After what has just been said, no farther comment                need be added
to show the absurdity of the terms accelerating force, innate force,
impressed force,       &c    All of   these    have arisen simply from           mis
translation.       Vis, by itself, is often   used   for force  ; but vis accelera-
trix, vis impressa, vis insita, and other phrases of the kind, must be
taken as wholes ; and, in them, vis does not mean force.
    The absurdity of translating the word vis by force comes out still
more clearly when we think of the term vis viva, or living force as
it is sometimes called ; a name for kinetic energy, which depends on
the unit of length in a different way from force.              It  must be looked
upon as one of the most extraordinary             instances of Newton's clear
ness of    insight that, at  a time when the very terminology             of science
was only as it were shaping itself, he laid down with such wonderful
precision a system absolutely self-consistent
    From the       passages just quoted, taken in conjunction              with the

                         of Edinburgh,       Session 1882-83.                                 11
second law of motion, we see that (as above stated) in Newton's-
view —
     Force is whatever          causes   (bat not, or     tends to cause) a change            in
a body's     state     of rest or motion.
  Newton gives no sanction to the so-called statical ideas of force.
Every force, in bis view, produces its effect. The effects may be
such     as to balance          or compensate one another; but there is no
balancing of         forces.
     (Next   comes       a discussion     as to the     objectivity or subjectivity of
force.     An abstract of this is given in                §§   288-296 of the article
above referred to, and therefore need not be reproduced here.)
  But, just as there can be no doubt that force has no objective
existence, so there can be no doubt that the introduction of this
conception        enabled Newton to put his Axiomata in their exceed
ingly simple form. And there would be, even now, no really valid
objection to Newton's system (with all its exquisite simplicity and
                                                         " force " and
convenience) could we only substitute for. the words
" action," Sec, in the statement of his laws, words which (like rate or
gradient,     <fec.)    do not imply objectivity or causation                   in the idea
expressed.        It    is not easy to see how such words could be intro
duced ; but assuredly they               will be required if Newton's system is
to be maintained               The word stress might, even yet, be introduced
for this purpose          ; though,   like force, it      has come to be regarded as
something         objective.      Were this possible,            we might         avoid      the
necessity for any very serious change                     in the form of Newton's
system.       I   intend,      on another occasion, to consider this question.
How complete Newton's statement                   is,
                                          most easily seen by con
                                                        is
                      "
sidering the so-called additions
                                 "
                                   which have been made to it.
     The second and third laws, together with the scholium to the
latter, expressly include the whole system of
                                             " effective forces," &c.
for which D'Alembert even now receives in many quarters such
extraordinarily exaggerated credit. The " reversed effective force "
on   a   particle revolving        uniformly in   a     circle   is   nothing     but an old
friend — " centrifugal force."             And even this phantom            is    still of   use,
in skilled hands, in forming the equations for certain                    cases   of motion.
     The chief arguments for and against              a   modem modification of the
laws of motion are therefore as follows — where we must remember
that they refer exclusively to the elementary teaching of the subject,

 12                   Troceedings     of /he Royal      Society
 and have no application          to the case    of those who have sufficient
 knowledge to enable them to avoid the possible dangers of Newton's
 method   : —
     L For Is it     wise to teach     a  student by means of the conception
 of force, and then     as it were to kick down the scaffolding by telling
 him there is no such thing ?
    II. Against. Is it wise to give up the             use of a system, due     to
 such an altogether exceptional genius as that of Newton, and which
 amply suffices for all practical purposes, merely because it owes part
 of its simplicity and compactness           to the  introduction of    a concep
 tion which,     though     strongly     impressed    on   us  by our muscular
 sense, corresponds to nothing        objective   1
    Everyone must answer these questions for himself, and his answer
 will probably     be determined       quite as much by his notions of the
usefulness of the study of natural philosophy               as by  his own idio
syncrasies of thought.          To  some men physics is an abomination,         to
others it is something too trivial for the human intellect to waste its
energies    on.   "With these      we do not reason.        To others again all
its principles are subjects of intuitive perception.            They could have
foreseen    the nature of the physical world,            and they know that     it
could not have been otherwise than they suppose it to be.                  Many
minds find delight in the contemplation             of the three kinds of lever ;
others   in the ingeniously          disguised    assumptions     in Duchayla's
" proof"    of the parallelogram of forces        ; some, perhaps, even    in the
wonderful      pages of    Vis Inertue Victat        The case of these men is
only not    more hopeless than that of the former classes because            it is
impossible that     it could   be so.
    But those who desire that their scientific           code   should be, as far
as possible, representative      of our real knowledge of objective things,
would    undoubtedly       prefer to that of Newton a system in which
there is not an attempt, however successful, to gain simplicity by
the introduction       of subjective impressions and the corresponding
conceptions.
    In the   present paper simplicity of principle, only, is sought for          ;
and the mathematical methods employed are those which appeared
(independent      altogether     of the     question    of  their fitness for a
beginner)     the shortest and most direct              A  second   part  mil  be
devoted to simplicity of method for elementary teaching.

    (1) So far as our modem knowledge goes there are but two
objective things in the physical world — matter and energy.                 Energy
cannot exist except as associated            with matter, and it can        be per
ceived and measured         by us only when it is being transferred, by             a
" dynamical transaction," from one portion of matter to another.
In such transferences it is often "transformed"; but no process
has ever been devised or observed by which the quantity, either of
matter or energy, has been altered.
    (2) Hence the true      bases    of our subject,     so far as we yet know,
are —
    1.   Conservation   of matter.
    2.   Conservation   of  energy.
    3. That    property    (those    properties     ?) of   matter, in    virtue   of
which it is the      necessary    vehicle, or as the case may be, the store
house, of energy.
    (3) The third of      these    alone presents any difficulty.          So long
as energy is obviously       kinetic, this property is merely our old friend
inertia.     But the mutual potential energy of two gravitating              masses,
two electrified     bodies, two currents, or two            magnets,   is certainly
associated (at least    in part, and in       some as yet    unknown way) with
matter, of a kind not yet subjected to chemical scrutiny, which
occupies the region in which these masses, &c, are situated.                   And,
even when the potential          energy obviously depends on the strain of
 a  portion of ordinary matter,        as  in compressed air,     a  bent spring,   a
 deformed elastic solid,     &c, we     can, even now,      only describe it  as duo
 to   " molecular   action," depending         on mechanism of a kind as yet
 unknown to     us, though,     in  some cases, at least     partially guessed   at.
     (4)  The necessity for the explicit assumption of the third
 principle, and a hint at least of the limits within which it must be
 extended, appear when we consider the very simplest case of motion,
 viz., that of  a lone particle moving in         a  region in which its potential
 energy is the same at every point.              For the conservation of energy
 tells us merely that its speed is unaltered.                "We  know, however,
 that this is only part of the truth        :  the velocity is constant.      It will
 be seen later that this has most important dynamical consequences
 in various directions.
     (The remarkable discussion of this point by Clerk-Maxwell is then
 referred to, in which it is virtually shown that, were things other

                               Proceedings           of the Royal          Society
wise, it would be possible for a human mind to have knowledge                                              of
absolute position and of absolute velocity.)
     (5) But            Maxwell's reasoning is easily                     seen    to apply equally         to
any component of the velocity.                             Hence, when we come to the case
in which the potential energy depends on the position, the only
change in the particle's motion at any instant is a change of the
speed        in the normal to the equipotential                             surface on which              the
particle is at that instant                    situated.               The conservation of energy-
assigns the amount of this change, and thus the motion is com
pletely           determined.          In    fact,    if   a;   be perpendicular           to the equi
potential surface, the equation
                                                                       = const,
                                   \m(£? + y2 + 2s) +             "V

language of quaternions,

In    fact, this problem                is precisely            the same as was that of the
motion            of   a    luminous        corpuscle       in    a non-homogeneous              medium,
the speed              of passing       through        any point            of the medium being
assigned.
     (6)     It    is next shown that the above inertia-condition                               (that the
velocity parallel to the equipotential                             surface is the same for           two
successive             elements of the path) at once leads to a                           " stationary "
value of the sum of the quantities                                 vds for        each   two successive
elements, and therefore for any finite arc, of the path.                                    This    is,   for
a   single particle, the Principle                    of    Least Action, which            is   thus seen
to be         direct consequence of inertia.

     But     it    is      necessary   to remember that, in these cases, we take                           a
partial view of the circumstances                      ;    for   a     lone particle cannot strictly
be said to have potential energy, nor can we conceive of                                   a    constraint
which does not depend upon matter other than that which                                            is   con
strained.              Hence the true statement of such cases requires further
investigation.

 i.e., the kinetic energy, referred to any point,                             is      equal to that of the
 mass      collected at its centre of inertia, together with that of                                   the
 separate particles relative to the centre of inertia.
      If   we integrate this expression, multiplied by dt, between any
 limits, we obtain       a   similar theorem with regard to the action of the
 system.
      Such theorems may be multiplied indefinitely.
      (9) From those just given, however,                                 we take them along with
                                                                     if

 be all free, while          the energy of each                      is   purely          kinetic and inde
 pendent alike of the configuration of the system and of its position
 in   space,

     (10) The result of (7) points to an independence between two
 parts of the motion of a system, i.e., that relative to the centre of
 inertia,   and that of the whole mass supposed concentrated at the
 centre of inertia.      Maxwell's reasoning is applicable directly to the
 latter,  if   the system be self-contained,          i.e., if it do not receive
 energy from, or part with it to, external bodies.                Hence we may
 extend     the axiom      3   to the centre of inertia of any such             self-
 contained      system, and, as      will presently      be  shown,    also to the
 motion of the system relative to its centre of inertia.             This, though
not formally identical with Newton's Lex              III., leads, as we shall   see,
to exactly the same consequences.
    (11)   If,  for a moment, we confine our attention to            a free system
consisting of two particles only, we have
                            TOj/jj + m^p„ = (toj + m2)a,
 or
                                           = 0

This must be consistent with the conservation                  of energy, which
gives
                       Kmjl +m2p!)=/(T(Pl-p2))                                    (2)
since the potential       energy must depend (so far as position goes) on
the distance between the particles only.             Comparing (1) and (2) we
see that we may treat (2) by partial             differentiation,   so far as    the
coordinates of ml and m„ are separately concerned.                   For   we  thus
obtain
                          ™iPi   =  V*./«=/.U(Pi-ps)

                                 = V,, • /     /-U(p, - p2).
    Each of     these,  again, is separately consistent with the equation
in § (5) for alone particle.          Hence, again, the integral f(m1v1dsl +
m2Vtfls2) has a stationary value.
    Hence also, whatever be the origin, provided its velocity be
constant,
                                     XmVpji   = 0.

    Thus, even when there is a transformation of the energy of tho
 system, the results of § 9    still hold    good.     And it is to   be observed
 that  if  one of the masses, say       m^,   is enormously greater      than tho
 other, the equation
 shows that,   pj is excessively small, and the visible         change of motion
is confined     to the smaller mass.         Carrying     this to the limit,     we
have the case     of motion about    a (so-called)    " fixed  centre."    In  such
a case  it Is clear that though    the momenta of the two masses relative
to their centre    of inertia are equal and opposite,         the  kinetic energy
of the greater mass vanishes in comparison with that of the smaller.
   These    results are then extended to any self-contained system of
free particles, and the principle of Varying Action follows at once.
It is thus seen to be a general expression of the throe               propositions
of § 2 above.
   (12) So far as we have yet gone, nothing has been said as to how
the mutual potential energy of two particles depends on their
distance    apart.    If  we suppose     it to be enormously increased         by  a
very small increase of distance,        we have practically the case of two
particles   connected by an inextensible string — as a chain-shot.              But
from this point of view such          cases,   like those of connection by an
extensible    string, fall under the previous categories.
   The case of impact of two particles falls under the same rules, so
far as motion of the centre of inertia, and moment of momentum
about   that    centre, are concerned.       The conservation of energy, in
such cases, requires the consideration of the energy spent              in  perma
nently disfiguring the impinging bodies, setting them into internal
vibration, or heating them.         But the first and third of           these, at
least, are beyond the scope of abstract dynamics.
   (13) The same may be said of constraint by a curve or surface,
and of loss of energy by friction or resistance of a medium.                  Thus
a constraining curve or surface must be looked upon (like all physical
bodies)    as deformable, but,     if   necessary,    such that a very small
deformation corresponds to a very great expenditure of energy.
   (14) To deal with communications of energy from bodies outside
the system, all we need do is to include them in the system.                 Treat
as before    the whole system thus increased,          and then consider only

with perfect generality whether the external               masses be themselves
free, constrained, or resisted.
    (15) Another       method of applying       the same principles          is thou
given.      Starting from the definition dA        = HmSpdp,        the kinematical

exhibited in their physical translations.

mental principles of the science as they have been introduced by
Newton, Lagrange, Hamilton, Peirce, Kirchhoff, and Clerk-Maxwell,
respectively     ;  and also  as  they appear in the unique Vortex-system
of Thomson.
       2.   On Illegitimacy in Scotland.             By Mr Geo. Seton,
                                   M.A. Oxon.
    In the    year 18G0, at the meeting of the Social Science Association
in Glasgow,       I read a paper on   "The    Causes of Illegitimacy        in Scot
land," which was published shortly afterwards                ;   and eleven      years
later (1871), at the meeting of the British Association in Edinburgh,
I  read another paper on       " The Illegitimacy of Banffshire," which was
privately printed.        On the present occasion    I intend     to confine my    ob
servations to the facts exhibited by the Registrar-General's returns.
    For   a good many years a perceptible improvement has been going
on   in England in      the matter   of illegitimacy    ;  and     I  am glad to    be
able to add that in Scotland also wo have evidence of a gradual,                  and
nearly as satisfactory, diminution in the number of illegitimate births.
During      the   two decades,    ending 1870 and        1880 respectively, the
decrease     in England     was rather more, and      in Scotland rather less,
than   1   per cent.

General it appears that, during the thirty-four years ending 1879,
the proportion of illegitimate children to every 100 births gradually
fell   from 6-7 to 4-7 per cent., or exactly 2 per cent, as shown in
the following table       : —

    As in Scotland, the         rates   have always greatly varied in different
 counties.     "While the average for the whole of England during the ten
years ending 1879 was 5-l per cent., that for Cumberland                         was as
high    as 8-9 —little more,       however, than half the percentage for Banff
shire, and only a fraction above               the average     for Scotland.     In   the
 extra-metropolitan       portion      of Middlesex       the   percentage   was as  low
 as 3-6.     With regard to illegitimacy,                England may be roughly
 divided into three      zones    :—        a  southern zone with the rate below
                                       (1)
 the average; (2) a midland zone with the rate somewhat above
 the average ; and (3) a northern zone with an excessively high rate.
 Perhaps, therefore, our English neighbours will feel disposed to
 suggest that the      proximity of the northern counties to Scotland may
have something to do with their high rate of illegitimacy.*                        Both
the English and Scottish returns show that                    in the great   centres   of
 population     the percentage of illegitimacy              is much smaller than in
the rural districts.        It  must, however, be constantly borne in mind
that a comparison of the numbers of illegitimate births in town and
   * It  has been frequently alleged that under the Scottish system of registra
tion the illegitimate births are more accurately recorded than in England ;
and that if the respective returns were equally trustworthy, the difference in
the ratio of illegitimacy on the two sides of the Tweed would not be so great
as it has hitherto appeared.         I am disposed to think that there is some truth
in the  assertion.    Roughly    speaking,    the percentage of illegitimacy in England
and  Scotland,   as indicated    by  the returns,   is at present about 5 and 9 respec
tively.    Probably   7 and   9  per  cent,  is  nearer the actual fact The object of
this paper, however, is not to compare the two countries, but to show the vast
differences in the percentage of illegitimacy which present themselves in the
various counties of Scotland.

20                    Proceedings    of the Royal Society
country districts respectively is not in itself sufficient to afford any
indication of the true     state of morality.      Every statist is aware that
the unrestrained passions -which in rural districts result in illegitimate
births   are  in large towns diverted into the channel of barren prosti
tution.    The English Eegistrar-General remarks that, " it is probable
that a considerable portion of illegitimate children are the offspring of
country girls who 'have gone into domestic service in towns, and
have there been seduced          ;  and    such girls    will often return       to
the country for their confinement, and thus increase the country rate
of illegitimacy     by the addition of births which from their origin
should duly be reckoned as belonging to the towns."                 On the other
hand, however,       it is quite   as  likely that   a good many mothers          of
illegitimate    children   conceived in rural districts        resort to private
lodgings or maternity hospitals          in large towns for the purpose of
being confined.
    In   Scotland,    during the two       decades   ending     1870 and 1880
respectively, there had been a diminution           in the  rate  of illegitimacy
to the extent of nearly     1 per cent, viz., 8 '8 instead of 97.       If a wavy
line  be drawn from      Portskerry, about twelve miles west of Thurso,
to Fort-George, and thence, by the eastern boundaries of Inverness,
Argyll Stirling, Lanark, and Ayr, to the mouth of Loch Eyan, it
will be found that all the counties to the west of the line present a
percentage of illegitimacy      below the ratio for the whole of Scotland ;
while two-thirds of the counties to the         east  of the line present    a per
centage    above that ratio — the majority          of the others yielding a
percentage     closely bordering on the national rate.         There were thus
ten counties on the west of the line in question below the national
ratio ; while of the twenty-one           counties on the east of the line,
fourteen ranged from 9-0 (Nairn) to 16*6 (Banff), and the remain
ing seven from 7 3 (Fife) to 8-7 (Selkirk). One of these seven
(Edinburgh) contains       a large city,    while three others (Fife, Clack
mannan, and Selkirk) embrace            towns of considerable size, thereby
probably accounting, by the barren prostitution            of large   centres,  for
the comparatively small number of illegitimate births.               The insular
counties     (Orkney and       Shetland)     were    considerably     below    the
national   average — having     respectively 6-0 and 4 '8 per cent.
    In   1881    the population      of   tho Western      area   amounted       to
1,859,000, and of the Eastern area to 1,814,000— a difference                    of

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1882-83.                                  21
only     45,000.    By far the larger portion of the Western                area is oc
cupied by an almost purely Celtic population ; while the inhabitants
of the Eastern area, with the exception of the county of Perth, are
chiefly Scandinavian or Teutonic.
     In  three of the eleven counties constituting the northern division
of Scotland, — viz., Nairn, Aberdeen, and Kincardine, — and in all the
counties south of Banffshire, with the exception of four, —amounting
in all to twenty, — the decrease in the rate of illegitimacy ranged
from 0-5 per cent in the          case of Roxburgh,       to  1*9  per cent, in the
case of Clackmannan.              On the other hand, in eight of the eleven
northern counties, and          also   in Argyll, Linlithgow, Dumfries, and
Kirkcudbright — in all twelve counties— there               had been an increase
in the rate, ranging from 0*1 per cent in                   Boss   and    Cromarty,
and Dumfries, to no             less   than 2*2    per cent,   in Caithness.         In
both     decades   Banffshire      retained the     discreditable    distinction      of
b»?ing    at the top of the list, showing the slight increase of 0'4 per
cent. (16'6 instead of 16'2) — in other words, one illegitimate child in
every six births, or nearly double the percentage for the whole of
 Scotland.      One county (Wigtown) was stationary at 16-1 per cent.
The two blackest spots have always             been three adjoining      counties in
the north (Elgin, Banff, and Aberdeen), and three adjoining southern
counties (Wigtown, Kirkcudbright, and Dumfries), the collective per
 centage of the two groups being almost identical.
     In  the case of rather more than one-fourth of the whole illegiti
 mate   births the paternity was acknowledged at registration             ;  in  a good
 many instances the paternity was subsequently found by decree of
 court and recorded in terms of the statute ; while about 3 per cent,
 of the children were legitimated by the subsequent marriage of their
 parents.*
    * During the four
                       years ending 1861, of the 7517 births registered in Banff
 shire, 1189 were illegitimate.     In the case of 389 of these children— or nearly
 a third    of the whole — the paternity was acknowledged at registration ;
 in 64 instances the paternity was subsequently found by decree of court
 and recorded in terms of the statute ; and in 28 cases the children
 were legitimated per subsequeng malrimcnium,             such alteration of statu
 being also duly registered.       In a few   instances  the judicial findings relate
 to children whose paternity was acknowledged at registration, from which
 it would appear that, notwithstanding the reputed father's adhibition of
  his signature to the register, the mother is occasionally induced to raise an
                                                                         ''             "

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1882-83.                                 23
     In his report relative to the year         1880,    Mr Daniel Stewart, the
intelligent examiner of registers in the southern district of Scotland,
gives some very startling            information      regarding    the illegitimacy
 of the counties of Roxburgh,            Dumfries,      Kirkcudbright,      and    Wig
town.       In no fewer than 33 parishes in these four counties, the ille
gitimate births amounted to 20 per cent, and upwards — a certain
small parish      in Roxburghshire exhibiting the enormous ratio of                 36 -3
per    cent  !  He   refers to the large number of          cases   in which      suiters
give birth to illegitimate children, and            to the numerous instances          of
the same woman being the mother of several                    children.       Thus, in
each    of twelve    specified   parishes,  two sisters registered       illegitimate
births during 18S0.          These 24 women had given birth to                 41   chil
dren.      In the   case of twelve of them     it   was the first child, while the
remaining twelve had collectively produced 29 children.                        In   each
of three parishes in three of the counties in question, ihree sisters
have had nine children             among    them,     while   a trio   in    a   certain
 Berwickshire parish have had at least ten. In nine parishes,                   mothers
 recorded their fifth, and in five parishes, their sixth child ;                most of
 them being either domestic servants or engaged                   in  some     kind of
 agricultural labour.       In  two cases, in the counties of Kirkcudbright
 and    Selkirk respectively,    a charwoman and a dressmaker          each recorded
 their seventh child.         To only    a small extent is the illegitimacy of
 the counties      in question to      be accounted      for by the prevalence         of
 concubinage.
      The result of Mr Stewart's inquiries           seems to point irresistibly       to
  "  a wide-spread low moral tone among domestic and farm servants in
  rural parishes," and mainly to that cause he is disposed               to attribute
 the large proportion of illegitimate births constantly occurring in tho
  southern counties.       Many registrars have told him that " language
  of the most     immoral kind is quite common among out-workers and
  other women engaged in farm work                ;   and when they have            once
  fallen they   appear to lose     all sense of shame and self-respect."
      Note. — Mr Stewart's report for 1881 (which has been received
   since this paper was written) furnishes further evidence of the pre-
   majority may yet be judicially established, and other cases of legitimation by
   the subsequent    marriage of the parents may also take place ; but no vtry
   material addition is likely to be made to the figures specified.

         In   a small Dumfriesshire parish a domestic servant, who recorded
     her   third (or fourth) illegitimate child, has three sisters, each of
     whom lias given birth to three bastard children — " who make a trade
                           "                                                      " as they after
     of the offence           (in the words of the local registrar),
     wards go out as nurses." In another parish in the same county, the
     percentage         of illegitimacy      had reached         the alarming ratio of 40 -7
     per cent!            In the county of Wigtown there                     was     not a single
     parish without illegitimate birtlis, and only in two parishes was the
     rate below the national average.                   In the other       15 parishes, the per
     centage ranges from 9 6 to 24-1.                   Numerous instances of hereditary
     illegitimacy occur in the southern counties — many women (them
     selves illegitimate) and their daughters recording bastards in the
     same register.

                             Bodies.      By Professor MacGregor.
         The following           pages contain an account of experiments made                     by
     myself and           Mr T. Lindsay, at the            request      of Professor Tait, to
    determine the absorption of damp air containing                          a   known quantity
    of water vapour, by finding in what proportions dry air and olefiant
    gas must be mixed in order that the aljsorption of the mixture may
     be the same as tliat of the damp air.                    The experiments were made

                    of Edinburgh,       Scssitm 1882-83.                 25
according to the method described by Professor Tait in a letter read
by  Sir William Thomson at the Southampton meeting of the British
Association (see Nature, vol. xxvi p. 639, 1882). They consist
of two   series — the   first, a series of rough experiments made, first, to
  determine whether or not the method would work, and, secondly, to
  find the dimensions        of the apparatus which would give the best
  result  ; the second,    a series of more careful experiments made when
   the method   was found to give satisfactory results.

      The apparatus which we          used for the    preliminary experiments is
  shown in diagrammatic section in the figure.             It  consisted of a cylin
  drical   gas reservoir     (A, A) of tinned iron, about 4 feet in length
  and 4*5     inches in diameter.         This reservoir may be called the
  absorber.      It  was placed      with its     axis   vertical    It  had     three
  openings B, C,       T>,  of which the two (B and C) were fitted with
  metal tubes and stopcocks, and were used for filling the reservoir
  with the    gas under investigation,       and the third     (D) was fitted with
  a metal tube      holding the manometer E.             The curved surface and
  the bottom of the absorber were surrounded               by another cylindrical
  vessel   F, F, also of tinned iron, whose sides were everywhere
 about 0-5 inch from the sides of the absorber.                  This outer casing
 had two openings (G,           H) fitted with tubes and stopcocks, the one
 at the bottom, the other at the top.                By their     means   the space
 between      A   and   F   could be kept full of running water.             On the
 upper end of the absorber was              a  flat cylindrical box      (K)    about
  1 inch in depth. The upper end of the cylinder formed the bottom
 of the box. This box, which may be called the radiator, was also
 provided     with two        stopcocks   and tubes     L, M, placed      as  in the
 diagram, by means of which            it could be filled with either water or
 steam.      For this purpose an india-rubber tube from M dipped under
 water in a sink, while L could be put in communication by means
 of   a three-way tube       with either  a  boiler or the water supply.          The
 absorber was thus completely surrounded                by a  jacket divided into
 two compartments, one of which was the radiator.                  The manometer
 E   consisted of a bent tube of about 1™" bore.                 It  was   provided
 with a stopcock N, was fitted in the tube             D by   means   of  an   india-
rubber      stopper,    and    contained   dilute sulphuric acid of known
density.      The levels of the liquid        were    read  off by the aid of a
card, with     a  divided scale, which was attached to the tube.
    The following is       a  description of our mode of observation.             The
absorber was first filled with the gas under               investigation.     Thus,
to    fill with dry air, B        was attached to a series        of drying tubes
(sulphuric acid and chloride of calcium) and C to the suction pump,
and a current was kept up until the dry air had displaced the damp
air which at first filled       A    To fill with moist air, the drying tubes
were replaced by wetting tubes.              To fill with defiant gas, C was
loft open, and the gas driven in from the generator at B until the

                      of Edinburgh,        Session 1882-83.                       27
air initially filling A had been displaced. Meantime water had been
kept running through both compartments of the jacket. The water
from the laboratory reservoir was found to be practically invariable
in    temperature    during the      course   of any one experiment.         When
the absorber had been filled,             and    the water had been running
through the jacket for          some    time, the stopcocks       B and C were
closed and D       opened.      The water was then kept running through
the jacket until the       gas   in the absorber had attained        a  practically
constant temperature, until the liquid in the manometer therefore
indicated     a  practically     constant    pressure.       The   barometer    and
manometer were then         read, and the temperature         of the water jacket
noted.      Then    L   was put in communication            with the boiler, and
the water in the radiator was displaced by                steam, after which     the
variation of the manometer with time was noted until it had again
reached     a constant state, when        the barometer was again read.            If
the readings of the barometer before and after any set of observa
tions were not the same, it was supposed to have varied uniformly
with time in calculating         pressures.     In all   cases the difference was
 very   slight, the   sets  of observations        lasting   only from 20 to 30
 minutes.     From the readings of the barometer and manometer the
 pressures were easily calculated.
     No precautions     were taken specially to exclude dust, so that, when
 water was present in the gas operated on, it was not necessarily all
 in the state of vapour.
     The following    are details of some      of the experiments     made.     The
 unit employed in the measurement of pressure is that due to a
 millimetre of the dilute acid solution used in the manometer. Its
 density was 1-1038.         Zero of time is the moment at which com
 munication     was   broken      between the radiator         K  and    the water
 supply,    and   established      between     the    radiator   and   the   boiler.
  Shortly after that the upper end of the absorber begins to rise in
  temperature, and the pressure of the gas contained in it to increase.
  When the steam      issues freely from the radiator,        it may be supposed
  to have very nearly reached a constant temperature.

  X. Olefiant Gas. — The absorber                 was now carefully dried, dry air
being drawn through             it,   while   steam was driven through both com

    If the above experiments be represented by curves, with intervals
 of time as abscissae and increments of pressure as ordinates, it                will
 be seen (1) that the curves have all, except           in the     case of  Experi
ment     XL,     the same general form     ;  (2) that the curves for dry air
tend, after different intervals of time, to the same value of ordinate,
except in the curiously anomalous case of Experiment                 XL ;  (3) that
the curves for air containing         different quantities       of water vapour
occupy in all cases a lower position on the diagram than those for
dry air ; (4) that the curve for defiant gas is above that for dry air ;
and (5) that the curve for dry air, containing a small quantity of
defiant    gas, is   in the  same region  of the diagram        as those for moist
air.   We thought it worth while, therefore, to try to find how much
olefiant gas must be added to dry air to give a curve coinciding with
that of air containing a known quantity of vapour.
   It  seemed      advisable,    however, to increase     the radiating     surface
relatively    to the surface of the absorber.            Tho apparatus which
we used      for subsequent experiments therefore differed from                 that
already described in two respects.           Tho diameter of the cylindrical
absorber was 18 inches, and the plato separating the radiator                     K
from    the absorber        A  was of copper, and      T\    in. thick.     It  was
made thick to prevent, as much as possible, its giving way under the
pressure to which        it was subjected, when the radiator was in com

                       of Edinburgh,      Session 1882-83.                        33
munication with the boiler or the water supply.                  It   was made of
copper, that its conductivity        might be as great as possible.
    The curved sides and bottom of the absorber were made as before
of the stoutest commercial tinned iron.             We thought it unnecessary
to have it made more rigid, as the pressure of the water in the jacket
was constant during each experiment.              The copper plate bent under
the pressure    of the water and the       steam, however, more than we anti
cipated,   and the differences in the amount of the bending                  caused
perceptible changes of form in the sides.           The   pressures    given below
are subject therefore to sudden         slight variations, which depend upon
sudden     changes of volume of the absorber, not upon absorption.
Hence the numbers jriven below cannot be taken as exact results.
It will    be noticed in the experiments           made    with this apparatus,
that after the steam         is turned on in the radiator, previously filled
with running water, the pressure at first diminishes, and only after
a certain   time increases.       This is not due to absorption, but          to the
fact that the water pressure          in the laboratory was slightly greater
than   the    boiler'   pressure which we used.          When, therefore, the
water pressure was taken off the sides of the radiator                  K,  and the
steam pressure was put on, the copper plate became                  less bent, and
the reservoir therefore became           suddenly larger, the pressure conse
quently falling.        As might be expected, in the       case   of an apparatus
not sufficiently     rigid, the first experiments made with it were much
more    unsatisfactory than the last.          The apparatus took gradually
the set determined       by the pressures employed.        If  the measurements
given    in the tables below       are plotted, the resulting      curves will be
found far smoother in the case of the later than in that of the earlier
experiments.        For   more exact experiments       a more     rigid apparatus
should be employed.
    For the following experiments a new manometer was used.                       It
 was made from a carefully         selected  tube of practically uniform bore.
    The mode of procedure in the experiments with the new reservoir
 was practically       the same as that described         above.       Tests   were
 applied more frequently        to find  if the reservoir was air-tight, and to
 find if  the  drying tubes were efficient.        Their efficiency was tested
 by  weighing at intervals the last of the series.

   XV. Dry Air. — The        absorber was dried by keeping both compart
ments of the jacket     full of  steam, and drawing       dry air through the
absorber until a U-tube       of carefully dried calcium chloride placed
between C and the suction-pump showed no change of weight in
the course      of an hour.     Both compartments of the jacket were
then kept full of running       water, of temperature       12°-2 C, until    the
pressure of the air in the absorber       had become constant,          when as
usual the radiator was put in communication with the boiler.

of last experiment, both compartments of the jacket were filled with
running     water of temperature 12° C.           When the    pressure had be
come     constant, and had the value 9154'1, dry olefiant gas was
driven     into the   absorber      at   I! (C being kept closed) until the
pressure      had risen to 925G       8.    Of the gas which the absorber
contained, therefore      1 -1 per cent, by volume was olefiant       gas.    The
olefiant    gas   was  prepared in the same manner as before,                from
rectified spirit and puro sulphuric acid.

     XIX.      Mixture of       Air    and Olefiant Gas, containing -06 per cent,
 by volume        of  Olefiant Gas.
                                        — The mixture of dry air and olefiant gas
 used    in Experiment          XVIII.     wa3 driven    out of the absorber by a
 current of dry air, which was drawn                    through      the absorber      for
 about twenty hours.              When both compartments of the jacket had
 been filled with cold water, and               B and C   closed,    the pressure   took
 the constant value 9289-2.               Dry olefiant   gas was then driven         into
 the absorber until the pressure took                the constant value 9295-4.
 The     gas   which filled the absorber contained therefore 05996 or
 about -06 per cent, by volume of olefiant gas.                   The temperature of
 the gas at starting was 12°-9 C.

   XXVI. — Damp Air,          containing 1"3 per cent, by volume       of Water
 Vapour.  —A     current of the damp air of the laboratory was drawn
through the absorber, which contained initially the gas in Experi
ment    XXV., until,      as determined      by calculation,   it contained       a
quantity of olefiant     gas so small as to be negligible.       The quantity
of water vapour present in the damp air, with which the reservoir
was then filled,     was    found by determining        the dew-point          The
room in which the experiments            were carried     out was large,       and
there was a slow passage          of air through it.      The dew-point was
determined by observation of wet and dry bulb thermometers. The
temperatures they indicated          were respectively     15°  and     12° -8  C.
The barometric pressure (reduced to 0° C.) was 759-83 mm. The
pressure of the water vapour was therefore 9 -71 mm., and the damp
air contained consequently 1-278 (or about l-3) per cent, by volume
of water vapour.

had been put inside the absorber twelve hours before the experiment,
and some of        it was still lying unevaporated in the             vessel.     The air
therefore was saturated.             The temperature     of the water jacket when
the reservoir was completely surrounded by water, and the pressure
was constant, was          12°-4     C.  Hence the pressure           of water vapour
 was about 10'68 mm.             The barometric pressure           (reduced to       0° C.)

     If    these experiments be represented            by curves        after the sanio

44                       Proceedings     of the Rvyal Society
manner as the former ones, the following results become                  apparent    :
— (1)   The manometric effect is very much greater with the new                than
with the old apparatus.            (2) The curves for any one gas, or mixture
of gases, do not coincide with one another. Thus corresponding
ordinates of the two curves for air containing             1*1 per cent, of olefiant
gas differ by about 4 or 5 per           cent,  or, as  it may   be put, one  curve
is 4 or 5 per cent, lower than the other.               Of the two curves for air
with   0-2 per cent,       of olefiant  gas, one is 2 to 4 per cent, lower     than
the other.       Of the two for air with 0-06 per cent, of the            same gas,
one is from        6 to 10 per cent,        lower than the other.        Hence the
apparatus used was incapable              of giving perfectly accurate results.
As we have pointed out              above,   the reservoir was not sufficiently
rigid.    With      a  rigid reservoir the curves for any one gas, or gaseous
mixture, would coincide at any rate in those portions corresponding
to considerable intervals          of time   ; but the inevitable difference in
the initial conditions of the experiments must in general prevent
entire coincidence in portions             corresponding     to short intervals   of
time.     (3) The dry air curves are with this apparatus the lowest
on the diagram.           To us this result was unexpected ; but Professor
Tait had     foreseen     it as a consequence     of the change of dimensions of
the apparatus.           (4) As in the preliminary experiments, the curves
for air containing olefiant gas and for air containing water vapour
occupy tho same region of the diagram.                  The relative positions of
the curves may be used to determine the relative absorptive powers
of the     gaseous      mixtures.      (5) The curves for air containing dif
ferent quantities of olefiant gas occupy positions extending over a
considerable area of tho diagram, and they are higher the greater
the percentage         of olefiant    gas (from    -032   up to 1*1).     By deter
mining      a sufficient      number of such curves a scale of absorptive
power may be formed, to which the absorption                     of air containing
known quantities of vapour may               be referred.      With our apparatus
it was impossible to form such               a scale   accurately for the reasons
given above.          But an approximate result is given by our experi
ments.      The curve for air with 1 -3 per cent, of water vapour (not
saturated) has above it the two curves for air with 0-2 per cent of
olefiant gas, and below it the two curves for air with 0'06 per cent
of olefiant gas.         Hence we may conclude that tho absorption of air
containing      1 -3  per cent,   of water vapour is between that of air con-

taining   0-06   per cent and that of air containing 0'2 per cent, of
olefiant   gas.   "With   a  rigid reservoir it would      be possible to deter
mine exactly the constitution of mixtures of air and olefiant gas,
and of air and water vapour having equal absorptive powers.
    The above experiments were made in Professor Tait's laboratory
during the summer vacation of              1882.     By the time they had
advanced thus far my vacation          was at an end, and      I could not wait
to get a new reservoir constructed and to complete them. I hope
Professor Tait may be able to complete them at an early date.
    I  must mention with gratitude the enthusiastic              assistance  ren
dered me by Mr Lindsay.             His cheerful contempt of failure and
his ready    resource   in difficulty contributed      largely to whatever of
success we attained.         We   are deeply indebted       to Professor Crum
Brown for the      use of apparatus necessary for the making of olefiant
gas.    Of course Professor Tait took a most lively interest in our
results, and we had at all times the benefit of his advice.
4.   Note on the Compressibility of Water.                 By Professor Tait
    To test by an independent           process  the    accuracy of the unit
of my pressure      gauge,    on which the estimated corrections for the
" Challenger " deep-sea thermometers depend, it was arranged that
H.M.S. "Triton" should visit during the autumn a region in which
soundings of at least a mile and a half could be had.                   A set of
manometers, filled with pure water, and recording by the washing
away of part of a very thin film of silver, were employed.                  They
were all previously tested, up to about          2i   tons weight     per square
inch, in my large apparatus.         As I  was otherwise engaged, Professor
Chrystal and Mr Murray kindly undertook the deep-sea observa
 tions ; and I have recently begun the work of reducing them.
    The first rough reductions     seemed    to show that my pressure unit
must be somewhere about 20 per cent, too smaH.                 As this was the
all but unanimous verdict of fifteen separate            instruments, the sur
 vivors of two dozen sent out,      I immediately    repeated the test of my
 unit by means of Amagat's observed values of the volume of air at
 very high pressures.       The result was to confirm, within 1 per cent.,
 ihe accuracy of the former estimate of the unit of my gauge.             I then
 had the manometers resilvered, and again tested in the compression

46                   Proceedings       of tlie Royal Society
apparatus.     The results were now only about           5 per cent, different
from those obtained in the " Triton."            There could be no essential
difference between the two sets of home experiments, except               that
the first set was made       in July, the second in November, — while the
temperatures at which the greatest compressions were reached in the
 " Triton " were at least 3° C. lower than those in the latter set.
Hence it seems absolutely certain that water becomes             considerably
 more compressible as its temperature is lowered, at least as far as 3*     C
       " Triton " temperature).         This seems to be connected with the
(the
lowering by pressure of the maximum density point of water, and I
intend    to work    it  out.    It   is clear that in future  trials of such
 manometers some          liquid    less   anomalous   than  water   must   be
 employed.
    Another preliminary result, by no          means so marked as the above,
 and possibly to be explained          away, is that by doubling (at any one
 temperature)   a high pressure we obtain somewhat less than double
 the compression.        This, however, may be due to the special con
 struction of the manometer, which renders the exact determination
 of the fiducial point almost impossible.

 1. Observations       of the Bainband from June 1882 to January
        1883. By Hugh Robert Mill, B.Sc, F.C.S. Communicated
        by Professor Tait.        (Plate I.).
    The series of observations to be described was undertaken in order
 to ascertain how far a small pocket spectroscope       could be relied upon
 for the prediction of rain, with       a view to its popular   use  for that
 purpose.
     The instrument employed was Hilger's smallest sized direct-vision
 spectroscope, its length being one inch and a half, and its diameter
 half an inch.      It was furnished   with the ordinary adjustable slit, and
 had no special provision for the exclusion of dust.         It is desirable,
  however, to use an instrument        which has the eyehole protected by a
  plate of thin glass, and the slit covered with a thicker plate.           In
  this  case care must be taken to keep the glass free from         scratches,
  ¦which   greatly obscure the spectrum.
     When the     spectroscope   is to be used the slit is made as narrow as

48                          Proceedings                of the Royal         Society
possible, and the focus adjusted until the spectrum appears      bright
and clear, with the black solar absorption lines crossing it vertically.
If there is dust on the slit each grain appears drawn out into a thick
black line running through the spectrum horizontally.                                          When these
horizontal lines are seen the slit 6hould be cleaned by gentle brush
ing with     a   camel-hair pencil.
     The spectrum of clear sky or                         a    bright cloud, in the instrument
used, is a coloured             strip apparently about an inch long and half an
inch wide.   On one side a band of red, apparently -^ths of an inch
wide, emerges from blackness and shades into a jVth inch strip of
yellow, which merges into a quarter inch space of green, passing into
an equal         area      of blue which dies away in hardly visible violet
Two or, in favourable circumstances, three black lines                                        (a,   B,    C)   are
seen   in the    red, one       (D)      appears        to separate the red from the yellow,                    a
wide nebulous line divides the yellow from the green, several very
thin lines appear in the green together with two thicker                                                ones   (E
and b), and in the beginning of the blue there                                   is   a    still darker line
(F); besides which              a   glimpse may sometimes be had of other lines
in the darker part of the spectrum beyond F.                                     On looking directly
at the sun many of the lines are split up into                               a   number of very fine
components,           and       the       whole         spectrum           seems      ruled     with lines
intensely black and geometrically narrow, most of which are invisible
in diffused light.              The nebulous line between the yellow and green
is   usually mistaken for the rainband at first, for                             it   varies in intensity
from time to time.                  A    more particular              observation           shows that its
intensity    at any time              is      proportional           to the sun's nearness               to the
horizon,    but       it   appears        to be sometimes affected                     by other causes.
Professor Piazzi Smyth has shown that this                                  is   a    dry air absoiption
band, and he defines                it   as   "   a   function of dry air and low sun."                      The
real rainband cannot be seen by itself in the little spectroscope,                                           but
an acquaintance with the spectrum soon shows that the width                                                    of
the D-line       is   not constant, and that when widest                              it   seems to shade
off gradually towards the red, resembling                              a   line ruled by        a fine       pen
with   a   very small hair in its point.                        It   can easily be shown that                this
widening     is   not due to             a    widening of the solar sodium absorption
line, by looking at             the sky spectrum through the flame                            of    a   Bunsen
lamp faintly tinged yellow with                         a     sodium salt             The D-line proper
is   thus replaced         by   a   brilliant yellow streak, and                  the rainband          is   seen

                        of Edinburgh,       Session 1882-83.                           49
as a    black line clinging      to its red side.         This narrow blurred line
represents      the hundreds       of thin lines produced by the absorptive
power of the water-vapour in the atmosphere, which can be seen by
using an instrument of sufficient power ; and although it is never
seen alone or measured         by itself,     it can    be employed as a valuable
weather indicator.
     The rainband was always observed by looking                   as near the horizon
as   possible,   so as to take advantage of the greater depth of air seen
through; the focus was carefully adjusted to give the sharpest possible
definition of the solar lines, and then the intensity                       of the band
together      with    the D-line       was     noted.      The    rainband     has   been
represented       by the letter      ir, and the       compound       line,   which was
always measured, may           be written shortly a3         D  + x.
     The great difficulty in recording               observations       is to obtain      a
constant     scale   of intensities.       It   has   usually    been the practice to
judge of the intensity of the band by the eye, and to record it on a
scale of 1 to 5 or 1 to 10, or else to measure it in terms of the
low-sunband.         The former plan possesses the disadvantage common
to all     purely mental        scales,   that there is no guarantee of the
 intensity which is represented by                a  certain figure one day being
 recognised      as  corresponding       to that      figure on another         occasion.
 Changes     in the illumination of the spectrum or in the condition of
 the observer      can hardly     fail to make       some    difference.     The   second
 plan is free from this defect to         a  great extent, but it is inconvenient,
 for beginners at least, because of the diurnal variations of the low-
 sunband.        Various mechanical arrangements were tried in order to
 famish     a scale which      would remain constant and could be readily
  reproduced,      but the results of the experiments were not very
  satisfactory, and it therefore seemed advisable to employ a relative
  scale   supplied by the spectroscope            itself.    The spectrum observed
  was so small that the principal Fraunhofer                 lines were brought near
  enough to be used as standards of comparison, and as the moisture
  in the air    does    not affect their relative intensities, the three most
  prominent (E,      b,  and  F) were fixed upon           as the units of the scale.
  The three increase        in darkness in the order E,            b,  F, and they    are,
  ronghly    speaking,     darker     in proportion to their distance from D.
  The method of measuring by this scale does not altogether get over
   the  objection    attached     to the use of a mental scale, although that
      VOL.  XIL                                                                  B

50                    Proceedings        of   the       Royal Society
objection is reduced to a minimum                   ;    and the method at best is              only
applicable to small instruments.               A spectroscope of                sufficient disper-
sion to split D, or even        b,   in diffused light would entirely                    alter the
appearance     of the lines, and the rainband                      would    appear as a         bawl
incapable of comparison          with them.                With the small spectroscope
used on a clear      sky the D-line appears about equal to                        £ in intensity
                                                            '
when the rainband            is at a minimum.                   As the band increases the
D-line    appears wider, becoming             in turn equal to             b,   equal to   F, and
greater than F.         In    this way         six        shades     of intensity        may be
easily distinguished,        and these may be represented shortly as —
                                     D   +   ir = E.
                                         „    >E<6.
                                         „     =b.
                                         „     >i<F.

                                         „     >F.
     The words wide, darjjc, black, and intense, when applied to the
rainband and the larger spectral lines, mean the same thing, for                                 it is
difficult to say whether       a large rainband makes the                   D-line apparently
blacker, or wider, or both, when viewed by the small spectroscope.
     Another point of    some importance                in the prediction of rain        is,   as has
been pointed out by          Mr Kand Capron, the visibility of the thin lines'
in the    green.    These vary greatly in distinctness, being sometimes
invisible and at other times very apparent, but                       it   is   difficult to avoid
changing the value of the words used to express the different degrees
of visibility.      A   long and intimate acquaintance with the spectrum
in its different     appearances       is    necessary in order to overcome this
difficulty.
     A   regular record of the intensity                  of the rainband has
                                                         kept                          been
since June 1882, and the weather which followed within twelve
hours     of each     daily observation at                9     a.m. has    also been          noted.
Other      meteorological      observations              were      subsequently       introduced
to supplement        those    of the rainband, but during                        the first seven
months the latter alone were considered, and                          a    prediction founded
thereon was written down each morning.                              The degree of intensity
warranting     a    prediction of rain was, of course, entirely                      a   matter of
experience, each success or failure modifying to                       a    certain extent the

basis of the next prediction.            At  first it was only necessary to use
the lines b and F for comparison, since D + w was very rarely < 6 dur
ing the months of June, July, August, and September. It was soon
observed that rain seldom fell within twelve hours when the D-line
at     9 a.m. appeared      less than or equal to        b,   and that rain almost
always followed         when    it appeared equal to or greater than F.
Intermediate intensities          were    much more common, and in order to
make predictions in         these cases the degree       of visibility of the thin
lines in the green was taken into account. From the daily observa
tions in the month of June the following table for predicting was
drawn up      : —

     This table held closely during July.            In  that month the intensity
 •was    =or>F      on fourteen       occasions,    and rain followed       on thir
 teen of these.      The intensity was >&<F with thin lines indistinct
 seven times, and rain followed six times ; on six days the intensity
 was the same, but the thin lines were distinct, and rain (in each
  case only a slight shower) followed on three.                  Once the intensity
  was =  b,  and  it was followed by a slight shower.             The table was also
  applicable,   though less accurately, to August,             September, and Oc
  tober, but in November its predictive power completely broke down.
  The intensity     was    =  or<   6 twenty-four     times in that month, and
  rain followed on fourteen of           these days.    The probable reason       of
  this is the low temperature which prevailed, in consequence                     of
  which    a small quantity      of water-vapour produced saturation, which
  was thus indicated by        a  fainter rainband than in previous months.
  A   new table of predictions         required to be framed for the winter
  months,    in which the intensities D +ir>E<6, and =E were con
  sidered.

perhaps more clearly seen 'when one or two very slight showers on
an otherwise     fine day are classed as
                                               " no rain," and this is evidently
a  fairer way of estimating the predictive power than by considering
a   day on which "no rain"             was    predicted and        a   trifling shower
occurred    as a failure,    A   better plan would        bo to omit all days on
which there      were   only slight showers, and simply take account of
those on which there was no rain at all or else heavy rain, suffi
ciently heavy, for example, to interfere with outdoor work. In Table
ILL it is seen that the increase in intensity of the rainband is not
followed by     a  perfectly regular increase       in the      percentage      of rainy
days, which is probably due to the scale not being perfectly uniform,
and that a dark rainband is a much surer prognostic of a wet day
than   a faint  one is of   dry weather.

    This table represents      the results for seven months, classing one, or
at most two, slight showers        as  " no rain."      Since the extreme values
of  the intensity    of the rainband illustrate       its predictive power most
strikingly, it may help to show the importance of such observations,
if a short account is given of the various cases in which D + ir was
registered as     >F   and as <b during the seven months under con
sideration.     During    these months       there were thirty-seven            cases of
D + x>F,      and on three of these          no rain followed          within twelve
hours.     Two of    these mornings      of failure   were     very misty, but the
third   was bright and clear.         On ten occasions heavy showers               came
 on in the afternoon.         On   one of these      occasions       (July    1st) there
 was   a  thunderstorm,        on another (September             1st)   the rainband,
according    to Professor Piazzi Smyth, was the darkest for the whole
 year.   There were heavy showers in the forenoon on three days
 and showers at irregular intervals on ten, two of which (July 6th

54                           Proceedings        of the Boyal    Society
and August 13th) were accompanied by thunderstorms.                                 On nine
days rain fell continuously, and on two there was continual snow.
There         were    thus 8 per cent,          of unsuccessful, and       92  per cent of
successful,          predictions       when     the rainband       was at its maximum.
It   was found           that on twenty-eight          occasions     D + ir was    < b.     On
eighteen of these               no rain whatever followed for twelve hours, on
four      one, or at most two,              slight showers followed.          On four con
siderable rain, and on two a considerable amount of snow felL                          There
 were thus 21 per cent,                 of erroneous, and 79 per cent,           of success
ful, predictions when the rainband was its minimum of intensity.

    The        success      of   a prediction      has been   judged of uniformly from
the frequency, duration, and intensity of the showers which followed,
and not by the rainfall in inches.                    This   was done because the       situa
tion of the observing station' (in the south side of Edinburgh) was
unfavourable for the use of a rain-gauge ; and as each prediction was
made for a period of twelve hours,                       the published rainfall for the

vicinity for periods of twenty-four hours did not form a trustworthy
index of the success of a prediction. If observations could bo made
twice or three times a day, so that each prediction would cover a
shorter time, and if the intensities of the rainband in different
directions    were compared each time, much more decided proofs of
the utility of the        spectroscope    as a short-period   predictor   might
reasonably be expected             Situation and circumstances rendered it
possible only to make an observation on the north-west sky each
morning at 9 a.m., hence all the results described in this paper are
deduced front        observations     in that direction    at that   hour.    If
possible the observation shduld be          made on a piece  of clear sky, but
the spectrum of the light from clouds is not necessarily untrust
worthy.       Out of 120 consecutive predictions       75 per cent,    of those
 made    on a clear, and 73 per cent, of those on a cloudy, sky were
 verified     The  spectroscope    cannot be used in a thick mist or    a snow
 storm, and its indications       in frosty weather are usually too faint to
 he of much value, although it may almost always be relied upon
 to predict   a thaw at least one day beforehand.
                 Remarks on the Chart        for January   1883.
    During the month of January 1883 the barometer and thermo
 meter were observed as well as the spectroscope,         and the accompany
 ing chart embodies the results obtained.
     The shading in the upper half of the column allotted to          each day
 represents the prediction, that in the lower half shows the degree of
 fulfilment      When the upper half is blank (e.g., the 2nd) "no rain"
 was predicted, and a blank lower half (e.g., the 4th) shows that no
 rain  fell   A   very light shading in the upper half (e.g., the 3rd)
 denotes    a prediction of "probably a little rain," slightly darker
 (eg., the 5th) means "some rain," while the very dark (as on the
  1st) stands for "rain." The lower half shows the rain which
 followed    up to 9 p.m., the length, position, and darkness of the
 parts shaded representing approximately            the duration,   time, and
 heaviness of the showers.           ¦
                                      Snow is shown by peculiar shading,
 as on the 27th.      The first and second curves join the points at which
 the   barometer and thermometer stood each morning              at 9 o'clock,
 and the third exhibits        the intensity    of the rainband in    a similar
  manner.      A  rise  in this curve corresponds      to an increase    in the

 5(5                 Proceedings     of  the  Royal Society
 intensity of the band.        The fourth line, which could scarcely            be
 represented by an ordinary curve, illustrates            the visibility    of the
 thin lines in the   green  on the scale —
              Invisible, Indistinct, Pretty distinct, Distinct,
.but for   reasons   already stated this curve is less reliable than the
 others.
     Summing up the results,     it is seen that on sixteen days     the   predic
 tion was that more or less rain would fall, and that this was verified on
 fourteen, or 87 per, cent.     " No rain " was anticipated on the remain
 ing fifteen days, and on twelve of them, or 80 per cent, there was
 no rain.     The mean percentage      of successful forecasts (83-5) is not
 altered by omitting those days on which only slight showers occurred.
  The 11th and 19th are the most marked instances of erroneous pre
 diction shown on the chart         It   is interesting to notice the general
 closeness  with which the rainband curve follows that of temperature.
 This is strikingly shown for maxima on the 1st, 17th, and 24th, and
 for minima on the 4th, 8th, 26th, and 31st.             When the divergence
 of the curves is considerable      the nature     of the weather to follow is
 always decided.       Thus, when the thermometer is low and the rain-
  band strong, rain is certain to follow, as it did on the 3rd and 21st
  for example, and when there      is a high thermometer and a         faint band
  there  will  be no rain, for instance, the 7th, 15th, and 20th.
     One great secret of successful rainband          predicting seems to lie    in
  making proper allowance for the temperature, and the direction               and
  forco of the wind have also a share in modifying           the data.

     The calming     effect of oil on troubled        waters is so well known
  and so often referred to, that we might have expected there would,
  by this time, have been a considerable amount of written                informa
  tion on the subject.      This calming       effect  of oil is not only well

that       it   seems to have acquired the stamp of classical                        antiquity upon
it,   yet one      is   surprised to find that reference to                   it   in early writers
is strangely conspicuous by its           Our knowledge of the sub
                                                   absence.
ject seems to have lived almost entirely in tradition.
      It   is   only within the last year that anything like definite attempts
have been made to test practically and on                        a    large scale the effect of
oil on the waves of the                sea.        The first of these             experiments were
made in March last at Peterhead by                          Mr Shields of Perth, who                   has
taken great interest in the                   matter.       Later on in December last                  he
made other experiments at the entrance to the Aberdeen                                        harbour.
The place           selected     by   Mr Shields for the latter experiments was
within the entrance channel, at                     a    point about 270 yards inside tho
furthest point of the north pier, and at rather more than 700 yards
outside the entrance to the tidal harbour. The channel       at this                         is
point .somewhat contracted, and has      breadth of about 240 yards.
                                                           a
To distribute the oil over the water, Mr Shields erected hand pump                      a
on the north pier, and connected                     it   with   a   pipe     1    inch in diameter,
which was laid on the bottom of the channel and carried out                                         more
than half way across it.                  The oil was pumped through this pipe,
and escaped             near the middle of the channel by three valves and
 roses placed across           it   50 feet apart, so as to distribute                   the oil over
 some breadth.             The oil pumped through the pipe rose to the surface
 in small globules and                spread       itself over the      water.         The   effect was
 very marked and               decided.        The oil smoothed over the waves and
 prevented          the formation of dangerous crests                  ;     the entrance to the
 harbour was thus made much safer for vessels.                                Mr Shields      deserves
 great credit for these experiments made on so large                               a   scale, and   it   is
 much to be regretted that this method of calming the waves                                       is   not
 less expensive.          Each of the experiments at Aberdeen lasted for one
 hour      ;    the value of the oil used in each was about £20, and though
 the effect remained for an hour after the pump was stopped, yet the
                                               am not aware              any experiments were
                                                                     it if
 expense does seem great.                 I
 tried to use less oil, but            it     is   evident that              is   possible to use too
 much.           There    is   just   one quantity         which will give the maximum
 effect    ;    more or less     will not do        so   well
      Since the experiments at Peterhead and Aberdeen called attention
 anew to the subject,            a    number of explanations of this peculiar action

58.                       Proceedings          of the Royal     Society
of oil have been given ; none of these,                     however, appear to me to
account for the facts.                 I    have therefore ventured to place the              fol
lowing experiments and                 a theory    built upon them before this Society ;
and though this theory may not appear to some to explain all the
phenomena, yet, as              it calls attention to certain           effects    of an oily
film, the importance of which has not previously                        been taken notice
of,    I trust     the subject may not be uninteresting,                  and may at least
be     of   some   little aid in helping forward           a proper understanding              of
this most interesting and difficult subject.
      The wonderful           effect       of oil on water has      suggested        to many
observers the idea that the effect                  was due to the oily film offering
less resistance to the          wind than the clean water surface             ;   that the oil
so     to speak greased           the wind.         The first    thing therefore           which
seemed        necessary       to be done was to test whether there was any
truth in this supposition              ; to   arrange   some    experiment        to ascertain
whether there was less friction between air and an oily film than
between air and           a    clean film.         The method adopted was to place
some water in a circular vessel, and arrange a jet of air so that                              it
should blow over the surface of the water, and cause it to take up
a motion of rotation.             Under       these conditions the rate      of rotation of
the water would — if the pressure of the air jet was kept constant —
depend on the amount of friction between the air and the water
surface.        If   the oil decreased the friction the water would be driven
less    quickly under an oily than under                a clean film.
      In order     to measure      the amount of motion communicated by the
air to the water,         a horizontal          paddle, completely        submerged, was
hung in the middle of the vessel by means of a fine platinum wire,
the upper end of the wire being attached to a torsion-head.                                   A
needle, rigidly attached to the paddle, indicated                    on a circular scale
the amount of torsion produced by the moving water, that                            is,   showed
the amount of energy communicated                        by the air jet to the water.
The air jet was supplied from                  a   gasometer,   which could be loaded
to different pressures.
       The following      is   the method adopted in working this instrument
The circular glass        vessel was carefully washed, and                filled with water
up to       a   certain height, which was               accurately adjusted for             each
experiment, so that the water was always oxactly the same distance
below the jet.          Air at    a    low   pressure was then   blown over the water,

                                                 Session 1882-83.                              r,9
                          of Edinburgh,
and the angle of torsion noted.                   The pressure in the gasometer 'was
then raised,      a stronger current was blown over the water, and the
reading      again taken.        In this way       a number     of readings were taken
at different pressures, the angle of              course increasing   with the       pressure.
After taking two or          three series of such readings to get an average
for the clean water           surface, a little oil was put on the water, and
another series of readings taken.                The result of these experiments was
that there was no          decrease    in the amount of deflection after the oil
was added to the water            ;   which shows that         as the air communicated
the same amount of motion to the oily surfaced water                         as      it did to
the clean       surface, therefore oil does              not reduce   the bite, grip, or
friction of the air on the water.
   In      working with this apparatus it was found very difficult                      to get
constant readings.            On making a new experiment, after washing
the glass      vessel,    some    change seemed           to take place, and the read
ings for the corresponding              pressures        were not always the same as
the previous      ones.      The general result, however, was that the oil in
a few cases slightly decreased                   the readings, but in most cases                it
increased       them a little.         The difference in the readings in the
experiments       with clean water,              seems   in   some way to be connected
with the       resistance    offered    by the film where it is attached to the
sides of the vessel,         and the slight increase given in most cases by
the oily film may possibly be due to the weakening of this film by
the oiL
      In   the experiments described, the surface                film simply circulated
in the     vessel and but    little free surface         was developed ;   if,   however,       a
division plate      was     put across the vessel just deep enough to stop the
 easy circulation        of the film, an interesting and curious result was ob
 tained.      When the pressure of the air jet was low,               so that    it   did not
 greatly     agitate the surface,           and the surface film could circulate
 quickly enough, there was then scarcely any difference between the
 readings given by the clean and by the oily surface.                            But when
 the pressure rose and the agitation                     of the water became          great,    a
 sudden increase in the amount of deflection took place                          ;   but this
 increase always occurred at                a    lower pressure with the oily than
 with the clean film, the explanation of which would                         seem to be,
 that when greatly agitated by the air new surface film requires to
 be   rapidly developed, and,          as   it   gets no aid from the contracting film

CO                   Proceedings of tlie Royal Society
in front, this new surface film          can    be developed by a lower          air
pressure in the weak oily film than it can in the stronger clean
film.    This extreme condition of         matters,    however, seems never       to
present itsolf in nature.
   Experiments     such as these made in the laboratory on water films
are  in the highest    degree  unsatisfactory.       Since    I have begun them
I have found     this surface film of water to be far more delicate            and
variable    than  I   had previously any idea of, and find it almost            im
possible to get     it in  a  uniform condition.         If   the experimenting
vessels are not cleansed      with something to destroy the last trace of
soap used    in washing off the oil,    if the  ves3el or the water is     touched
with the fingers or exposed for any length of time to the ah- of the
laboratory, changes take place in the surface tension.                It therefore
seems that more       satisfactory   experiments might be made on large
sheets of water.       As yet  I  have been unable to do anything in this
direction except one experiment, which, on account of the smallness
of the   sheet of water, may not be of much value.
    The object of the experiment was to see          if the  wind communicated
less horizontal motion to the surface water under an oily than under
a clean film,   which would      be the case    if the wind has     a less  grip or
bite of oily than of clean filmed water.             It will    be observed here
that   I  leavo out of consideration          any question as to        a  possible
slipping of the oily film over the water, .without dragging the water
film underneath along with it.             If  there is any depth of oil, its
upper surface cannot slip over the lower more easily than the same
depth of water could, as oil is more viscous than water, though                  wj
might imagine the bounding surface might prevent the formation
of eddies and the deepening of the motion             ; but we have seen from
the experiment       with the jet of air on water in            a circular vessel,
that there is no evidence of any slipping forward,                as the body    of
water underneath takes up the same amount of motion whether tho
surface is oily or not.
    In the experiments     made on tho small sheet          of water, the rate of
motion communicated by the wind to the surface water was tested
by   means    of small circular    floats 9 cm. diameter and 4 cm. deep.
The floats    were submerged 2 or 3 m. and         only   a  thin stem projected
above the water.        Two of    these floats were      dropped into the pond
 near that end from which the wind was blowing, and at some distance

apart,         at right angles to the direction                          of the wind.            These floats
were allowed to                   drift to the opposite end of the pond to                                see that
the rate of motion was the same                           at both sides.              Some oil was now
poured over the water at one aide, and other two floats started over
the same routes as the first two.                              It   was found that the two floats
still travelled at the same rate,                              that oiling had not perceptibly
altered          the       rate    of motion.           We might               almost have expected                 a
different result, on account of the waves on the clean water affording
a    better catch to the                wind, but possibly this advantage might                             be lost
by the eddies and irregular motions resulting from the waves.
     I    do not place any great reliance on the accuracy                                  of   these experi
ments, and the last one is evidently on too small a scale ; yet                                            I think
if    the effect           of oil on troubled waters is due to its reducing the grip
of the wind, the reduction would require to be very great, so great
that       there           would have          been     some        evidence of it even in these
imperfect             experiments.
      There          is,   however, another consideration which indicates that the
oil       does   not produce its effects by reducing the friction between the
air and the surface                    of the water.           Oil itself when exposed to wind
is       driven into waves very much as water is.                                    It    may be that the
waves are not so marked                         in oil   as    in water, but this               is   chiefly due
to the greater                 viscosity of the          oil        This      was   seen   in   some        experi
ments made on                     a   small scale for the purpose of observing the effect
    of    wind on          a   body of oil.           For this purpose two shallow                          vessels
about half             a    metre square were placed in an exposed part of                                  a   field,
where the              wind could blow freely over                       them.      One vessel was filled
with oil, and the other with water as                                     a    standard with which to
    compare       the movements of the oil.                         It   was observed that            if    the oil
    was    thick and viscous there was but little effect, and scarcely any
    surface      circulation           produced    ;     and    it       required    a     strong         breeze    to
    drive the         oil into        waves.     But with paraffin oil, which                        is   thin and
    mobile, the result was very different                           ;    it   seemed more easily driven
    into       waves        than      even     This was probably due to the oil
                                               water.
    having       a    less specific gravity than the water, but  think the com        I
    paratively         greater agitation observed in the oil was partly owing to
    the water          surface not being quite clean, on account of the paraffin
    vapour which               could not easily be prevented from condensing upon
    it,   so   that the water was not so easily driven into waves as                                       it   ought

to have been.             little of the paraffin oil was put on the
                       When         a
surface of the water it made it much quieter than the body of oiL
     When we pour          a   little oil on   a   wind-driven surface of water, the
effoct    is so marvellous,         the smoothing          of the waves is        so   instan
taneous, that         the imagination          is carried      away, and wo at           once
attribute    to the oil some wonderful property, though we may                               not
understand what that property is.                     When, however,         we    examine
its action and consider what is taking                     place, we see that      it is not
doing, it is preventing something which previously took place, and
we are driven         to consider what it has prevented.                In   fact, we are
driven     to examine how               the wind gives rise to waves.                  It will
therefore be necessary for us, before saying anything about the effect
of oil, to examine how wind                acts on the surface     of water, and gives
rise to waves;         we shall         afterwards     better understand          the effect
of oil.
  The upper surface of water, where it is in contact with the air, is
covered with a film having a well-known and definite tension.
The tension of this film is always in a state of equilibrium, and the
slightest stress acting on a part of it causes the surface to move
in the direction of the strain.                When    a part   of the film moves, new
film or free surface is formed in the rear of the moving area, and
covers the water which was previously covered by the displaced
film, while the film in front of the moving film is diminished in
area, part of    it being absorbed by the water.                   No work is required
to develop this new         film,   as the work done by the contracting                part   of
the film in front is equal to the work spent in developing the new
                                                                             is,
film in rear of the moving area. The result of this       that the
slightest stress acting on the surface of the water determines                     a    move
ment of that surface, its motion being                      in no way checked by the
surface    tension.
     Suppose, now, the wind to blow over the surface of                       a    sheet      of
water, which, for the present, we              will suppose to    be quite motionless,
and for clearness          let us suppose          further that the wind strikes the
water at only one place.                The result    is   that the surface film where
the air strikes       is   blown forwards, and in sliding over the water                      it
produces waves, one set of waves being produced in front of the
moving      film, and another set produced by the moving film being
raised in the act of being driven over the water underneath.                           Now    if,

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1882-83.
instead of supposing the wind to act at only one place, we consider
what actually takes place in nature, namely that the wind strikes
the surface of the water at all points, hut more strongly at some points
than at others, on account of the eddies produced in the air in its
passage over the resisting water, it is evident under these conditions
that certain parts of the surface film are more powerfully urged for
wards than others, and the water yielding to this unequal action is
driven into       a series of waves, having a gradually accumulating                        effect
This    effect is intensified hy one side of the wave heing thrown up
into such      a position that the          wind        acts more     powerfully on it than
on the other side, or than on               a horizontal surface.
   Let    us now- look at the action of the same water surface, hut over
•which       there has     been thrown a film                   of    oil     The surface has
entirely changed its             character.       New free surface or film cannot
now     be   developed     without       the    expenditure of energy.  If we try
to move forwards one part of the surface, we find its motion is
resisted hy the tension of the surface behind    it increasing on
account of the removal of the oil, and the tension in front of the
moving       area does not increase            but diminishes.              The forward move
ment     of the film is therefore checked.                      Suppose now the wind to
blow over such          a surface, the parts where the                 wind strikes strongest
will tend to move forwards, but will                        be unable to do so on account
of the increasing tension behind                        and reduced tension             in front.
Further, the parts upon which the wind strikes least                            are drawn         for
wards by the greater tension in front of them and behind the parts
tending to move most quickly, and where the wind                                    has developed
 an increased surface        tension.          The result of this             is,   that the wind
 cannot drive forwards isolated patches                       of film or surface         so as to
cause    waves, but the whole of the surface                      is   caused       to advance at
nearly    a   uniform    rate,    and the formation of waves                   is    thereby pre
vented.
   In illustration of            these   points         the following experiments were
 shown —Two large
         :                   shallow        rectangular vessels with parallel sides
were prepared.           Both     vessels      were filled with water, and over the
surface      of   one   was put      a   little oil, the other being kept                   clean.
Narrow strips of paper, about                  2   or   3   cm. broad, were cut to such             a
length that they would when expanded by the water be slightly
shorter than the breadth of the vessels.                             One of these        strips    of

64                         Proceedings         of the Royal      Society
paper was put across the middle of each vessel.               For the purpose of
moving these papers               over the surface of the water two threads were
previously           attached to each of them near their ends.                     Taking first
the vessel with the clean surfaced water, the paper strip was                                        by
means of the threads moved                    into its position right      across the       middle
of the       vessel.      It   was shown that the paper strip could be moved
backwards and forwards over the surface of the water, with the very
slightest         expenditure           of        in the slightest
                                             energy,    the film not
degree resisting the movement, the free surface or film in front
contracting quickly and pulling as strongly as the new film which
was developed in the rear.                     It   was further       shown    that after         the
paper strip had been moved backwards or forwards into any position,
it remained where it was put.*
     Turning to the oily surfaced water, it                     was shown that the move
ment of the paper strip on its surface was resisted,                          the threads            by
which it was moved becoming tightened when it                              was dragged           from
its original           position   ;    and further,     that when the tension was dis
continued the paper returned to the place from                            which it had been
moved.            It   did not matter whether it was moved backwards                                 or
forwards, it always returned to its original                          position, so long as no
surface film was allowed                     to pass    round the ends and get to the
other side of the paper.                     The tension on the threads in               these    ex
periments represents the resistance which an oily film offers to the
forward movement by the wind of isolated areas of surface film.
     This resistance is not, however, the most important                           effect    of the
oil.     It    is,   so to speak, the secondary effects that are most                    powerful
in checking the formation of                     waves.       On oily surfaced water the
forward        moving area reduces the tension in front, and causes the
film there         to advance on account            of the greater tension in front              ;   it
also increases           the tension behind, and so causes the film in the rear
to be drawn forwards, and the irregular film advance which takes
place in clean water              is   converted into     a   uniform and regular advance
by the oil.             This   was illustrated         by the arrangements used in the
previous experiments.                   A    small piece of paper to act as             a   float to
  *
       This    was found to be an excellent test of the cleanness             of   a   surface   film.
If   there   is   the slightest impurity       on the surface    it   gets collected in front
                                                                             of
the strip, and the paper cannot be moved quite to the end of the vessel without
meeting with resistance.

show the movements of the surface film, was dropped on the clean
water and near the long narrow strip of paper. The long strip was
now moved away from the float, when it was seen that its move
ment had no influence on the float, as it remained in its original
position, and further, the float did not move when the strip was
moved towards it. The long strip might be moved in any direc
tion, but the small piece of paper had no tendency to move till it
was almost touched by it.                    The   reason   for this want of sympathy,
so to speak,          between the two pieces             of paper is due to the surface
tension being everywhere alike, and free surface appears and dis
appears without a ay disturbance of the surface tension.
  "When the same experiment                        was repeated         on the oily water the
result was very different.                   There was now a bond of union between
the two       pieces.       If   the long piece was drawn away the small piece
followed        it,   if   moved       up to    it   the small        piece      receded      from     it
These movements of the float were pointed out to                                  be the result of
the disturbance produced in the surface tension by the movement
of the strip. The forward movement of the strip causes the oily
film in front to           become       thicker, its tension therefore becomes less,
and    it   tends to expand forwards, or rather                  is   drawn forwards, by the
thinner film in front, and the                 free surface which           is   developed in the
rear of the strip          is    rapidly covered by the advance of                      the   oily film
which brings with               it   the paper float.       It   was shown from               this that
 the forward movement by the wind of isolated                                 areas     of oily film
 was not only resisted, but that their forward movement gave rise to
 forward movements of the film, both in front and in rear of them.
 From        these experiments          it   will be   seen      that   a   clean water surface
 acts towards the horizontal force of the wind as                           if   it   had no surface
 tension      whatever,          whereas an oily film acts very much as                           if   the
 water was covered with a thin skin of india-rubber.                              Or the stability
 of   a   clean water surface             might be compared to that of                        a   perfect
 sphere on       a    perfectly horizontal           plane, and the stability of an oily
 surface to that of an egg on its side.
      The effect of this regulating influence of the oil on the surface
 tension       may be illustrated             in another way, which shows that the
 uniform rate of advance of the surface film produced                                      by the oil
 prevents the formation                 of    waves or ripples.             If   the long narrow
 strips of paper           in the previous experiments                are moved         quickly over

the surface of the water, the following effects                              are seen.            On the
clean water, the advance of the strip gives rise to                              a series     of very
evident and well-marked waves or ripples in front of                                 it,   whereas on
the oily surface no waves are formed.                           The film       is   seen     simply to
contract in front of the moving                     paper.         In      order to regulate            the
motion      of     the strips        in the different             experiments,       a     convenient
arrangement         is   to attach to     a   pendulum the threads which are fixed
to the paper strips, and, by drawing the pendulum                                   and strip aside
to the same amount                 in each experiment, we can regulate its drag
on the strip with considerable                    precision.          If   we wish to compare
the effects of equal amounts of energy spent in each case, so as to
get results corresponding to equal blasts of wind, then the pendulum
should be light         ;    and   if   we wish    to see the effects of equal rates of
motion the pendulum ought to be heavy.
     When we examine the surface of                         a     sheet of water under the
action of the wind, we observe that the floating                                bodies on its sur
face are all moving forwards — all are carried forwards by surface                           a
current, but   closer examination of the smaller bodies lying close
                    a
to the surface shows that the advance of the surface film                                    is   a   jerky
one   ;   one part       of the surface advances quickly, then stops, then
another part gets into rapid movement, and the general appearance
is   that of   a   patchy and irregular advance of the surface film.                                  With
oil on the surface all this                is   changed     ;     the floating      bodies are          all
now seen to be hurrying forward                        at   a   nearly uniform rate, the oil
having      entirely      checked the           patchy      and irregular           advance which
gave rise to waves.
     Paradoxical        as   it   may at first sight appear,            it   is- nevertheless         true
that the weakening                 of the surface film by the oil                            source of
                                                                                 it is
                                                                                         a
strength to the surface of the water, and enables                                     to resist the
action of the wind.                The oil, in fact, makes the surface film inex-
tensible to small strains, and so regulates the action of the                                         wind
that waves are               prevented, and         no effect produced save                  a    nearly
uniform sliding forward of the                   surface.
     Supposing          the explanation          here given         to be true as regards the
formation of small waves or ripples,                        yet   a   cause so small seems at
first sight quite inadequate to explain so wonderful an effect as that
of oil on      a   stormy sea, and       I    can easily imagine the question being
asked. What effect can this very weak resistance of the surface film

They indeed         seem to have but            little relation to        each other.         Before
coming to any conclusion on this point it will be necessary                                   for us
narrowly to examine what really is the                      effect of   oil on already formed
waves.
    Let us therefore examine any small sheet of water over which
there is passing a series of well-formed waves, and see                          if   the explana
tion we have given of the formation of small waves or ripples applies
here to the effect of oil. As we look upon the waves as they pass us,
we observe that their surface is very far from being smooth ; on the
contrary,   a regular series           of   waves are being formed by the                 wind on
the surface of the large ones.                  These waves are small at the bottom
of the large waves, and grow in size as they approach the top In
fact, the wind is repeating on the waves very much the same process
as when     it first begins to blow on calm water.                           This action on the
                is is,
large waves              however, infinitely more rapid than on the calm water,
as the   wind         blowing with far greater violence than ever does on                it
calm waters     ;    and further, the slope of the surface of the water on
large waves being towards the wind,                        causes    its action to be much
more powerful than on                a   horizontal surface.            Now, the breaking of
large waves     is       very evidently connected with the formation of these
smaller ones which form oil them, and grow in strength towards their
tops, where they form crests                    and break, thereby adding dangerous
qualities to the wave.
    We have already              seen that      oil prevents        the     formation of small
waves on calm water               ;   it    will therefore prevent the formation of
small waves on the surface of large ones, and will thereby prevent
the formation and breaking of their crests.                         In order to       test whether
this conclusion           is   correct or not, let us again examine the surface
of the small sheet of wind-driven                    water, and, while watching                 the
waves as they glide past, let us pour over them                         a   little oiL    At   once
a   change takes place           ;    small waves no longer form on the already
made     waves, the latter simply continue on their course smoothed
and rounded on their surface.                     We       see that the      oil by precluding
the formation        of small         waves,   has prevented the roughness and the
pointed crests which previously                    formed on the waves and which
break when          the wind          is    sufficiently     violent.        Further,    it   seems
 probable that the smoothness of the large waves, produced by the

  G8                 Proceedings   of tlie Royal Society
  oil preventing the formation of small waves on their surface, must
  not be neglected, as    it will reduce the bite or grip of the wind,
 and thereby reduce its action on the already formed waves.
     Carrying out this process of reasoning, we           see  how the great
 waves of the ocean are increased and made dangerous by exactly the
 same     process' which we have     seen     in operation in smaller ones,
 only intensified and    made more dangerous by the greater surface           of
 the large waves, while the oil, by preventing the formation on          their
 surface of smaller     waves, hinders     the development       of dangerous
 crests.    That oil has no other  effect on the great waves of the sea       is
 confirmed by the experiments made at Aberdeen.               I  am informed,
 by Mr Smith, the harbour engineer, that there was no perceptible
 lowering of the waves after the water was covered with oil.                Its
 action was simply to smooth over the waves and prevent them from
 cresting    or breaking,  an effect   of great importance      and value    in
 making the entrance to the harbour safer during stormy weather.
     It will  be observed, according     to the explanation      here offered,
 that oil has no power to calm waves        ;   it simply acts by preventing
 their formation and growth in certain ways.            The resistance to ex
 tension offered by an oily film      will also have, no doubt,       a slight
 effect  in cheeking the up and down motion of the water, but the
 practical effect of this resistance must be very small and quite un-
 appreciable.
     It may be as well for us to note that the general question of the
growth of waves has not been under consideration             here, our atten
tion having     been entirely confined   to the effects   of surface tension
on their birth and development.
    Properly   to understand the vast importance       of so small a cause as
the slight difference of tension produced by the oily film, we have
only to remember that large waves have their genesis in tiny ripples,
which by the cumulative action of the wind grow into large waves,
and tho oil, by preventing the formation of the ripple, strangles the
wave in its birth.     On the other hand, the perfectly balanced tension
of the surface of clean water is as tho " letting out of waters," as
" the thin    edge of the wedge," as the stone detached from          the top
of the mountain which brings along with it the irresistible avalanche.
Prevent the beginning and the disastrous results are obviated.

sion of clean water and oily water is too small to give                                               rise to
surface currents or film movements                         of sufficient velocity to produce
these effects, and that the                   film would break, that               is,   that all the oil
would be blown away before the film behind could be dragged for
wards.         The ease with which the film glides over the water, and
the velocity         with which            one part of the film can drag another                              is,
however,        much greater than might at first be imagined.                                      Take the
following examples            :   — Drop        some    oil on the surface of water                   ;    note
the extremely rapid               spread of the            oil        Now, the rapidity of that
surface movement             is   the measure of the power which that particular
oil confers on the water of dragging forwards surface film.                                          In   fact,
the rapidity        of that advance              is   the same as that with which the
film can rush forwards                   in rear of        a   wind-driven          area.          That sur
prisingly rapid movement seems sufficient to perform the duty the
theory here propounded                   lays upon it.
    Another experimental                  illustration, better suited to the lecture-
room,     is   made by taking             a   small piece of paper, say 10 cm. long by
2   cm.   broad, and attaching to the opposite sides of the ends of                                          it
two small pieces of                 camphor.           This      is   easily done with               a    little
bees-wax.           If    this piece of paper with the attached camphor                                      bo
placed on the surface                of clean water,           it    at once starts into             a    rapid
motion     of rotation,           which will          be   kept up for hours, till all the
camphor        is   dissolved      if     the vessel of water             is   large enough.               The
rapid     movement           is    here       due to the            tension of       the      pure water
surface on one side of the strip being greater than the tension                                              of
the weak         solution      of camphor on the other.                           The paper          is   thus
dragged        round by the unbalanced                         tension     of the clean surface.
Or we may vary the experiment by placing                                 a   number           of    pieces   of
camphor on one side of the paper.                              If   this paper      is   placed on the
surface    of a pond,        it    will be rapidly drawn over the water.
    Take       another example of the wonderful                          effect    of this difference
of   surface tension.             Fill   two vessels       full of water       ;   put    a   little oil on
one   of them, then dust some fine powder over the surface of the
water     in both         vessels.        The powder                must be free from                 greasy
matter — well-burned               ashes sifted        through fine wire gauze does well.
Now direct          a    jet of air vertically downwards                   on the surface of the
water.         When this       is    done on the clean water,                  it   will    be observed
that the       very slightest possible current of air causes the surface film

 70                    Proceedings        of the  Royal Society
 and the dust floating on it to move away from the place where the
 air strikes, leaving a perfectly dustless surface.             Repeat the experi
 ment with the oily surface.              It will   now he found that however
 hard you hlow you cannot drive                 back the oily surface, and that
 when the jet of air is sufficiently strong to cause a deep depression
 in the surface of the water, the dust particles              are seen  rushing at
 certain places into the depression and running out at others with a
 velocity perfectly surprising.
    This   easy   slipping of the surface film may also          be seen when  the
 water is in motion and the film at rest.                 Recently   I observed a
 small stream flowing quickly enough to give rise to slight disturbance
 of the surface flatness, and yet the surface film was quite motionless.
 While the stream          was    flowing     underneath,   the advance     of the
surface film was checked              by some      weeds and grasses forming a
floating bridge       across   the stream.       If  the surface had been quite
clean this would       not have taken place, but a film of weak tension
had collected in front of the grasses, caused by impurities derived,
probably from the bed of the stream, and not from the air, as the
stream was in the country, and far from towns aud factories.                  The
tension     of the surface in front being less than that behind, the
strain put on it by the under current was not great enough to cause
it  to be absorbed      in front of the floating obstruction.         A somewhat
similar    effect  may he noticed when we stir up — not round —a cup
 of  tea and then drop      in  a  little  cream.    The surface film movements
of the oily     tea are seen to stop while the tea        mixing with the cream
can still be seen in active movement.                 The drag of the   tea on the
surface film is not sufficient to develop new free surface against the
resistance of the increasing surface tension of the cleaner film, and all
surface movements are stopped, save circular ones, which do not re
quire the development and absorption of free surface.                These surface
movements are sometimes stopped by a rigid pellicle forming on the
surface, but they are also stopped when no such covering is present.
    It  is generally recognised that rain and snmll floating bodies have
an influence on the water somewhat similar to that of oil, and tend
to calm its surface.         In the     case of the rain   it  seems possible that
the great amount of free surface added by the drops causes                     the
surface film to expand and act somewhat in the same manner                       as
oil, as we know that water dropped on the surface of water causes

another way in which              these       rain drops act.         In falling on the sur
face, the drops mi-y up the shallow film                         current — which makes the
ripple — with the water underneath, and thus destroy it. Much of
the calming effect of rain             is,
                            however, no doubt due to the falling of
the wind, which generally accompanies rain.
    Small floating bodies act on the surface of water in different                              ways.

shows that these calm lines are associated                       with long sinuous lines of
floating       bodies, such      as leaves,       weeds,     &c, and they attribute the
calmness        in part to the damping action of                   these   bodies acting like
floating breakwaters, and destroying small ripple undulations. The
author of the paper referred to also points out that part of the
calmness        is   due to oily scum or film      ;    he also shows how these floating
bodies and scum             may      be      collected in long sinuous lines by the
surface currents produced by descending currents due to difference
of temperature.              These      surface        currents,     coming    from        opposite
directions, bring with them floating bodies and scum, which collect
over descending areas or lines.                That part of the calmness of these

under somewhat different conditions.                        If   we examine the surface of
a    canal when the wind             is    blowing very nearly straight                    along   it,
we      see    that on the side           of the canal towards which the wind
inclines to blow, there           is   a   strip of smooth glassy water extending
for about a meter from the bank.                       This smoothness        is   evidently not
 caused       by the protection of the bank, but              is   due to impurities on the
surface       collected there by the wind,               as the calm area           has     a   well-
 marked line of demarcation, and                  is   present when the wind           is    almost

    t 1 have also observed that rapidly flowing streams when they enter still
 water often have calm areas in front of them.     This calmess seems to be due to
 the rapid absorption of the surface film of the stream which here takes place,
  and any surface impurities brought by the stream get concentrated and
  become sufficiently great to reduce the surface tension.

waves,         but       ripple or roughen the surface of the water
                      wind   can
amongst them, whereas oily scum does not destroy waves, but pre
vents ripples or darkening of its surface.
     My observations on the appearance of the canal                         suggest    another
way, in addition to the one given by Professor Thomson,                               in which
oily scum and small floating bodies collect near other floating bodies.
One evident effect of floating bodies is to check the forward advance"
by the wind of the surface film of water, and the shallow                              surface
current        is thus converted        by floating         bodies into a deeper           but
slower current.           The result of this is that more surface filni with
its impurities comes to the floating bodies than goes away.                            Surface
impurities therefore tend to collect in the neighbourhood of these
floating breakwaters.
     In addition to this action of small floating bodies in destroying
waves there is another way in which small bodies, such as ice-
spicules,       &c,    act, and smooth the water by preventing the                formation
of ripples.           Small floating bodies prevent           the formation of ripples
or waves by deepening the current, and so                      offering a resistance to
the rapid advance of any part of the upper film of water.                              Weeds
and grasses lying on the surface of the water prevent the irregular
                                                               irre
advance of the surface film, by the resistance they offer to the
gular advance of any part of  and by the drag or pull they exert on
                                         it,
the water behind the parts tending to move quickly.     Weeds and
grasses thus tend to promote              uniform rate of advance at all parts of
the surface, and thereby prevent the formation of ripples or waves.
     It   is   obvious   that all oils    will not have the       presame power to
vent the formation    of waves.    It    therefore desirable that we
                                                     is
should have 6ome information as to the value of different oils or
other substances for this purpose.    The value of an oil will depend
on   a    number of things,        the most important           of which are (1) the
rate at which the particular oil will                 distribute itself over the sur
face of the water.  This will depend greatly on the difference of
tension between the surface of clean water and the surface of the
water covered with the oiL                 The greater this difference the more

powerful will that particular oil be. The rate of movement will
also probably depend on the viscosity of the oil. The value of the
oil -will depend (2) on the amount of it required to cover unit
area.        "With these two properties             will require to         be taken      into con
sideration         a    third point,      namely, the          market      price     of      the    oil.
Besides        these points,         attention      will require to          be     given to the
specific gravity of the oil, its solubility in water, and the rate of its
evaporation into air.
     I    have been able as yet to give attention to only one of these
points.        A       few oils have been tested to find the amount to which
their presence reduced the surface tension of water.                                 Most of the
methods for ascertaining                  the    surface tension of a liquid are not
suitable for testing that of an oily film. In the oily surfaced water
we have not only to measure the tension of the oil, but also the
tensions of the bounding                   surfaces of the oil and the water.                        As
these       combined       tensions vary with the amount of oil on the sur
face, the ordinary methods of testing are not suitable, as they do not
admit of uniform conditions.
     It    may be as well to remark here, that there is not, as many
people       suppose, a distinct           line of demarcation between the surface
covered with clean film and that covered with oily film.                                     That     is,
the oil wherever present                 does not always reduce the surface tension
to the      same amount.            On the contrary, there            is   no line of demarca
tion between the clean and the oily film                         ;    the one shades          imper
ceptibly into the other, and the amount to which the oil reduces
the surface tension depends on the quantity of oil                                present.         Very
little oil gives         a    very slight       reduction      of tension, and as more                is
added        the tension becomes            less   till    a   minimum       is   reached,         after
which no reduction takes place.                       This condition           is   indicated        by
the       oil ceasing to spread rapidly.                  Its movements after this                 stage
is    reached depend upon whether                    the oil     is   lighter or heavier than
water.        If   lighter,    it   very slowly spreads itself over the water, its
movements              being now due to gravity.                If   the oil   is    heavier than
the water,         it   collects and forms on the surface depressions, which
deepen, and ultimately               a   large drop of oil breaks away and slowly
sinks in the water.              The breaking away of                these drops forms        a    very
beautiful experiment, and the slowness of the                         process gives an oppor
tunity of studying             some interesting phenomena.

74                    Proceedings   of tlie Royal    Society
    For testing the surface tensions an indirect way of measuring the
tension of the surface of water in a vessel was adopted.             This was
done hy finding the amount of pull necessary            to raise a flat disc
off the surface of the water.        The disc in rising brings with it           a
certain quantity of water, and the amount of water lifted depends
on the height to which the disc can be lifted above the surface
before the film yields,     and, as this depends on the strength of the
film, the weight of water lifted forms an indirect way of measuring
the strength of the film.        The apparatus used consisted of           a  cir
cular disc 4-5 cm. diameter.         In  order that this disc might hang
horizontally   as nearly   as possible,  it was accurately turned       on    the
end of a metal    rod     The upper end of this rod was hung to one
end of the beam      of a balance. To the other end of the beam was
hung a glass tube, inside which was placed a scale with the zero
point near the top of the tube.        A tall   narrow vessel   full of water
was placed underneath, and so that the tube hung in the water.
The tube was loaded with mercury till it just balanced the metal
disc with the beam of the balance horizontal,             and the tube        im
mersed in the water up to the zero point.             In  order- to get     good
contact between the water and the metal disc, a coating of                 plain
collodion    was put on the disc.         After all the collodion solvents
luid escaped, the apparatus was ready for a test.            The   vessel   with
water to be tested      was placed under the disc and at the correct
height, the beam, when the disc touched the water, being               slightly
inclined downwards at the disc end.           The tall vessol of water was
now    slowly lowered.      As the level of the water gradually went
down,    the weight    of the graduated tube increased.            While      the
level of the water descended,      a careful watch was       kept to observe
at what number on the scale the disc broke away from the water.
    The object of using the submerged tube was that it allows of an
increase of weight being put on very gradually and without shock.
    With this instrument the different readings for the          same sample
of water always agreed easily to    1  per cent., though they varied      3  or 4
per cent, for different samples   if the   vessel which held the water was
not carefully cleaned.
    Owing   to the principle   of the construction of this instrument,          it
does not give absolute readings, nor do the readings of the scale repre
sent numerically    the relative strengths of the different films, so        that

 readings got from the different oily surfaces do not correctly represent
their relative        values.   The readings, however, enable         us to arrange
the different oils in the relative order of their strengths.
     A     few of the more easily obtained oils were tested with this
instrument In the following table these are arranged in the order
of their tensions on the surface of water, beginning with the weakest
tensions, or those which would              be most powerful       in checking the
formation of waves : —

          Cod-liver oil.                           Mineral oiL
          Olive oil.
     The first few oils in this list      are the best, and do not differ much
 from        each   other.    Cod-liver oil is not quite        so   good, olive    is
 decidedly less powerful, while the three mineral oils               are by  far the
 worst of all,       as they reduce the surface tension very much less than
 the others.         The   same result was,    I believe, got in the experiments
 at Aberdeen.           Mineral oil was there found to         be loss effectual   in
  calming the waves of the          sea than seal or cod oil.
 4.     The following communication from the Astronomer-Royal
                  for Scotland was read by Professor Tait :—
      In    case you should not have any better account of it from those
  who keep hourly, or           perhaps    continuous,    observations,    you may
  like to mention to the Society this evening, on no more than my
  twelve- hour testimony, — the occurrence of a decided meteor, of
  meteorology, last night
      The maximum outside temperature yesterday about                    2 p.m. was
  40° -5,    and the minimum         temperature, self -registered,   for the night
  was      37°"0 ;   while at    10 a.m.  this morning      the then temperature
  was 41°-0, or       nothing very different from the day        before.   And yet
   for all that, and some time during the darkness of the night, there
   had been an influx of warm wind, with a temperature of 51o-0                !
       It  lasted, too, sufficiently long to impress an inside maximum self-
   registering thermometer         as  well  ; for while this should not have

76                    Proceedings     of the   Royal Society
read through the night higher than 52°-0,             it was found this morning
to have marked 61°-5.
   One consequence of this has been, that while the snow of last
Saturday held its own very tenaciously all yesterday on the top                       of
the Calton     Hill, there is not the smallest particle of it visible this
morning      on any side, or in any nqok and corner               ;  while the grass
of the hill looks fresher,      greener,  healthier than      it has done through
several years past, at the same date.
   The present winter began indeed in a very threatening manner
with its great snow-storm early in December.                    But, as    I  had the
opportunity     of mentioning in the Registrar-General's              return for that
month, the appearance         would probably be found to be exceptional,
rather than characteristic of the whole season : for we were too far
advanced at the present time into the middle of a sun-spot cycle, to
fear any of those thoroughly         and throughout         severe winters      which,
according to the Edinburgh Royal Observatory observations, have
never occurred but at, or near, the beginning of such a oycle.

               1.  On Ancient Tenure of Land in Scotland.
                             By Mr Auldjo Jamieson.
    I deem     no apology due for introducing          to the notice of the Royal
Society the subject of          the .present    paper.     The   close and accurate
criticism which          distinguishes     modern scholarship        has    allied all
branches of knowledge in a common scientific system ; and the laws
which regulate the development of human society                  are now recognised
as  being not      les3 inexorable      than those of which        the operation on
material     objects is the       more frequent      theme in this        room.     To
exhume the forms and types of ancient society, to subject them to
close analysis, to      identify their prototypes and         trace  their evolution
in our modern life is not          less a scientific   study than to dig out the
nodules of remote          ages from those ancient         records the rocks, and
to subject them to that analysis               which  detects their    identity with
forms    of life still extant          But with this difference in our present
inquiry    :  the forms of existence of which the nodule is the repre
sentative have transmitted            their characteristics through        so great a
succession and variety of forms as to make their identity with, or
even relation to, any modern type distinguishable                in most   cases  only
by subtle processes          of analysis    ; they are    themselves callous and
dead, and have no direct contact with the life of the present day                      ;
but the systems of ancient society have not undergone that process
of extinction and disintegration in transmitting their characteristics                 ;
it is less   in the alembic that         decomposes     than by the scalpel that
exposes, that      their characteristics    are discoverable; they do touch, and
that often closely, the living present, and there is danger therefore
that in the search for ancient               truth  a nerve may be sometimes
touched that may send a           thrill into living organisms in our modern
 society, aflame     as some of these are at present           with fevered     sensa^
 tion and debate.
    I must disclaim       at the outset all pretence to originality         in either
 my investigations or their results ;          my object and purpose will be to
 present  in  a   brief and conventional         form some of the more salient

100                Proceedings of     the Royal Society
results which recent scientific investigation          has reached as to the
relations in which men have stood with reference to the soil               of this
land in the earliest days of which we have             a  record, and to trace
back to these pristine    forms such of the main characteristics           of our
modern land system as derive their origin therefrom.               The study of
such subjects has of late progressed so rapidly, and the light thrown
on the dark records of the distant past by the patient labours an                 i
skilful investigation   of such scholars as       Dr Skene, Sir H. Maine,
and others, has been so clear and so searching that the time seems to
have come at which     it may   be fitting for   a mere disciple to enter on
the task — not perhaps altogether inappropriate to one brought often
into practical contact with existing phenomena of the nature we are
to consider — of identifying those characteristics of human experience
in this relation of life which in the long evolution of society have
stood the test of survival as the fittest for the later development of
human Ufa
    The task    I thus undertake would        necessitate     at  its outset     an
ethnological    sketch of our Scottish     land as we now know           it ; bat
I will  leap over many perplexing       difficulties   by assuming a general
assent to the view that when the curtain rises on its modern history
Scotland    was thus peopled, — the Lothians, Fife, Forfar, and             Aber
deen,  with  a population almost   wholly Saxon      ;  Sutherland and Caith
ness  with  a race also Saxon, but largely     Danish and Norwegian          ; and
all the rest of Scotland Gaelic, saturated in Galloway with Saxon or
 Frisian influences, and characterised in the         same    district by traces
 of a more ancient race;    with fringes of Irish Gaels on the coasts of
 Argyll and of Danes and Norwegians in the Isles.
    I suppose   the rough view which most men who thought                  on   the
 subject at all had, until a comparatively recent period, formed           of   the
 growth    of society, was its development from             a  family into      the
 patriarchal form, and then a number of patriarchs combining                   with
 their respective families to form     a community,       a country, or a    stau.
 But nothing in this inquiry is now more clearly determined than
 that the unit of primitive society, and the centre of all archaic land
 systems was not the family, but the tribe.          The family      as we  know
 it was   a comparatively    late creation, and      I   think we may douU
 whether it had any definite place among our                own forbears      until
 Christianity lent its sanction to the domestic relations.              Commn

                    of Edinburgh,       Session 1882-83.                     101
nity of wives unquestionably characterised that system out of -which
the Gaelic and the Saxon alike proceeded, and contemporaneous
therewith was the community             of land which was unquestionably
the first form of tenure,      if that can be called tenure which nobody
held.     The earliest traces that exist of social life in the         past, and
all the analogies that scientific investigation         has discovered in the
more modem types of archaic society which survive, point irresistibly
t«i the conclusion      that while individual       rights   existed   and wero
recognised in personal property, the soil was regarded and treated as
the common property of the tribe            ; and  naturally   so, while  as yot
man sought his scanty subsistence           in the chase    and in the waters,
and the untamed earth yielded to him in common with the                    beasts
he hunted only the spontaneous              tribute of its wild berries and
roots.     "While  it would     be affectation to assert      anything   definite
of   a state  of society which has left behind it so few traces, and
these necessarily so indefinite, still one can discern the first germ of
right and title in land in the right which the tribe itself naturally
came to assort as against other tribes in the region within which it
first began to settle     ;  the choice corries of the deer, the favourite
pools of the salmon, above all, the dwellings             of their dead, would
 begin to possess an individual value to that tribe which first began to
 haunt   these localities, and other tribes     would    be taught to reverence
 what the one tribe had begun to value; and this was probably the
 dawn of land right and land tenure.
    The tribe first   emerges    with us from the darkness of barbarism
 at that epoch of its existence when restrained and coerced               by the
 growth of population       the nomadic habits of the race began to give
 place to pastoral life, and man began          to assert his supremacy over
 the brute creation otherwise than by hunting them.              "When first the
 tribe or its individual components began to           feed cattle the necessity
 of feeding ground      made   itself felt, and it is just at that point that
 economic history      really begins ; there is no trace of which           I  am
 aware of a common estate in cattle.             On the contrary everything
 tends to the conclusion that among the early inhabitants of this land
 cattle was the form of property over which the individual rights of
 man was first asserted, and cattle became             the measure in and by
 which other rights and property were appreciated.               Cattle was the
  money of the ancient people with whom we are now dealing, and

102                     Proceedings      of the Royal     Society
was at the same time the measure and token as                well  as  the substance
of their wealth.
   It  is in Ireland that we must seek both the origin of our Gaelic
tenure and the only reliable records of its early growth,                  while   the
original features of our Saxon system must be sought                  in the records
that survive of the systems of our German ancestry.                   One important
element in differentiating            the Gaelic and the Saxon systems was
the earlier Christianity of the         Irish and Scottish Gaels, an element —
that early Gaelic Christianity of ours — so thoroughly distinctive and
so full of special influence, which has left deeper and more frequent
traces on our national character and habits than those who                distinguish
only the catastrophes that signalise abrupt revolution can recognise
or are likely to acknowledge.
   Giving therefore its due precedence to the more ancient system,
the land which the Gaolic tribe held when first we can throw any
real light upon it had ceased to be the mere grazing ground of the
cattle   :   agriculture of a rude type had begun to be practised, and the
land over which the tribe assorted its sway was of four classes                 —the
land appropriated to the dwelling and its immediate surroundings,
 the land appropriated to cultivation, the land appropriated to pasture,
and the land left free for the chase or otherwise unappropriated.
This is the pristine and rudimentary                 form of land tenure and of
society based thereon, which must be accepted                  as the   uniform   and
invariable type which has prevailed              over every part of the world in
which       man has risen above          the level of the savage.        Not only in
Aryan communities of every variety and of all circumstances, but
in communities of Mongolian,                 African, and Polynesian descent
 Modified it was of course by climate, and by soil, and by the innate
habits of the people         ; but wherever men have begun to assert their
supremacy over the earth and its products we find these four distinct
stages of tenure      : — first, the homestead with its yard, the only private
or separate property of the tribesman              ;  second, the cultivated     zone
                                               the " field

climates where vegetables more                than   grains are the food of the
people     ;  third, in  races   of a  pastoral type the common pasture land          ;

perhaps —but always the magazine from which, as it grew, the tribe
drew its supply of fresh land for its increasing numbers.
     A   very pleasing and simple picture of pristine society is thus
presented, and one to which it would rather seem that there is an
anxiety in      some     quarters to revert;     it is well therefore to dispel
delusions and to point out that this typical condition                 of ancient
life   existed    with us only       as an   imaginary    point   from which to
measure the advance to more developed systems.                    The influences
which sway mankind now, swayed them in                  these olden times     :  the
inexorable laws which operate now among the myriad incidents of
our modern         life operated then with the          same    force; and it is
interesting to distinguish         their operation where we can discern the
immediate       succession of cause and effect so clearly as we can in
those simple communities, just as we can best discern the growth
of the organs of riper life in the rudimentary forms they present in
 the lower types of creation.
     What then        are the influences     to  which the historian      and the
 social economist attribute the growth and development of our race                  ?
 Laying aside the influences of religion            as operating    in  a different
 plane from that in which we are now moving                   in this inquiry,     I
 apprehend      physical    energy and      money, the active potentiality        of
 brute strength, and the passive and accumulative force of labour and
 self-denial,    of which wealth or money is the result and embodi
 ment — are those forces which have operated and do                  operate  most
 strongly on human action         ; the strong     man and the rich man, the
 strong nation and the rich nation are those which dominate, and
 in our primitive society no sooner has the curtain risen on the simple
  pastoral scene     I have  briefly sketched, than the action of the drama
  begins by the strong man rushing in on the stage — the Saul of the
  tribe, lofty in stature and bold of heart, to claim the share of the
  common property         due to his superior       prowess— and we find the
  social equilibrium at once disturbed in order to find for this           Kingly
   man his fitting tribute.
      Therefore   in the Celtic tenure the mensal lands of the king and
   the lands devoted to his special maintenance were the first to be
   cut out of the common property         ; the king had his own share of the
   lands as a member of the tribe, and he had the mensal lands besides
   to support his royal state.        These mensal lands remained no doubt

 104                   Proceedings           of the Eoyal Society
still  vested   in tho tribe, and            tbe king had but         a user  of them for
his life or office.         Then came the church, and another part                   of the
 tribal lands — the ternal — was               set aside     for it.    But   an  influence
 more powerful, perhaps because more subtle than even the                        regal and
 tho religious, operated          to disturb the equilibrium            — money   began to
 exercise its sway     :   dealing with the Irish             as the   oldest type   of the
 Gaelic tenure, we find the share of the annual allotment of land wa^
 regulated    by tho extent of the herd of each member of the                       tribe ;*
 perfect equality oven in these early days was a matter of theory,
 and was maintained not because men were equal, but only                         until the
 supremacy     of tho fittest had asserted itself according to the inviolable
 law of progress; and as personal property was undoubtedly separate
 and individual,     the thrifty,         the   skilful, tho industrious, would soon
 become the rich      in cattle,        and would soon como to have an increas
ing sharo of the common arable                    land, while the pasture was           still
 common      to all    equally.          Thence arose         a   very peculiar form of
tenure ; when       one      of the tribe became               so rich as to have more
 cattle than he could find pasture for on his own allotment, he lent
his surplus stock to less careful or less fortunate members of the

    It  is  very notable that in this, which wo must accept as the
 most pristine form of the relation between                     landlord and tenant, tho
 landlord    was   required         to    contribute      the     stock  as  the essential
 elemont    in the   transaction, and the ront was paid not for the land
 but for tho stock       ;  it  is evident that tho idea of a separate personal
 possession of the land was very imperfectly developed at that stage
in   the history of tho tribe at which the power of money first began
 to effect a differentiation between the mombors of the tribe, and we
 have    the germ     presented         to us of the relation now so familiar            of
 landlord and tenant.
    But this rudimentary differentiation which                       we recognise   in the
 Irish tribe rapidly grew, and it developed                   into one of the worst and
most fatal, but     still    essential, characteristics          of all early tenures and
of all early society       ;   if it contained witliin it          the germ of tho land
lord and tenant of later days, it contained                 a germ     of more dangerous
import to, and more              immediate influence on, infant communities.

When the richer man contributed only               a   portion of the stock to     a
freeman       of the   tribe who already possessed        some    of his own, that
poorer     freeman had to return a third of the value of the stock
annually for      a specific period ; but when the freeman had no stook
of his own,      he had to give security      for the return of the stock lont,
and to pay a food tribute, the type and evidence of vassalage, twice a
year.     The former, the " Saer Ceile,"         were    the antetypes and pro

or bond tenants, were the antetypes and ancestors of the serfs and
servile races, from whom the charity of the church and the chivalry it
begot    in long years after, and with many a painful effort, struck the
shackles of slavery.          Dr Skene says :— " With the Saer Ceile the
basis was a mutual contract for a fixed period, usually of 6even years,
by which the chief         gave a portion   of stock proportionate      to the food-
rent he was to receive in return, and was entitled along with this to
the homage of the tenant during the subsistence of the contract, and
to a certain amount of service in the erection of a dun or fort, the
reaping of his harvest, and the sluaged or hosting              ;  but the contract
would be terminated and the parties to it return to their original
relation to each other, either by the tenant returning the stock he
had received         or the    chief   reclaiming    it.     A    more   permanent
connection       was formed between him and the daor ceile or bond
tenant.       Here the ceile placed himself formally under the protection
of the chief        as    his permanent     follower     by   receiving   a  certain
number of       seds or cows, by way of subsidy or         gift from the superior,
and paying him a certain tribute as the price of his protection.                  As
soon     as   this relation     was constituted     he received an additional
amount       of stock in proportion       to the food-rent ho had to return,
in the      same    manner as      in the   case  of the free ceile.        The real
distinction probably was, that in the one                case the ceile was     in a
more independent           position, and possessed stock of his own as well
as a share        of the tribe land, besides what he received from the
 chief.     In  the other he was dependent upon what he received from
 the chief for the whole of his stock.           When tho chief reclaimed his
 stock from the free ceile, the latter had the option of becoming a bond
 ceile if he preferred doing so to returning his stock, and the chief was
 then bound to add the returnable seds to the stock he had originally
 given, which constituted the relation between him and the ceile as

100                   Proceedings      of  the   Royal Society
a   permanent dependant.            This   process,     therefore,     not only led to
the freemen     of the tribe being gradually absorbed into the class of
the dependants or following             of the chief, but           placed   a powerful
weapon    in the hands of       the latter, by which he could transform                 his
temporary free ceile into pormanent and more                    sorvile dependants." *
    The separate      ownership       of land by inheritance seems to have
resulted in the Coltic tribes at first from a tacit prescription,                       the
precise origin and foundation of which it would be very difficult to
determine.      The firm hold which from the first each member of                       thi>
tribe evidently had on his homestead                gave to the       skilful breeder or
the careful tender of his herd a fulcrum no doubt on which he could
work the lever of his wealth; and when for three                           generations a
family retained possession of land, that possession                   became the basis
of title and of    a   right transmissible by the holder to the succeeding
members of his        family;! thus originated, it would               seem almost by
accident or intuitively         the right      of separate        perpetual tenure, on
which    was    raised    the   superior class of territorial            magnates   — the
original chieftains of the septs and clans                    into which     in its latter
development in Scotland, preparatory to its final extinction, the tribe
broke up.
     And when that       time for its extinction came, when Alexander                  III.
 died in 1286, and the fresher, freer, nobler influences of Saxon and
 Norman life stirred the stagnant system of Celtic society and gave
 life and vigour to our Scottish institutions, the form which the tribe
 had assumed in Scotland was this ; there was the central figure,                       the
 thane, possessing      a large   part of the lands        as  his demesne, represent
 ing the monsal         lands of earlier days,            and     very large rights       of
 superiority and service from the inferior members of the tribe                     ; over
 these thanes there held rule more or less defined,                  and originating in
 circumstances     exterior to the tribal organisation, the earls of the
 seven provinces, but that rule was less,            I apprehend,       a matter of land
 tenure   than    of personal        rule;   below       the     thanes    came   a   class
 which    can   best    be   described     as    freeholders holding         their   lands
 in absolute    fee, but bound        as the    condition of their tenure to give
 personal   service and to pay certain definite and elaborately regulated
 duties; below them again            came a class of free or             kindly tenants,

"liberi    et generosi,"            who held portions of land for ten or twenty
years, or for life, with remainder to one or two heirs; these were the
representatives of the Ceile of the Irish system, for in many cases
the landlord provided                  the stock and implements, and the rent paid
was higher in proportion                   to the value of these steelbow goods, the
rent of the land itself being probably                      a    fixed quantity.          With     these
ended the grades of free tenure, but below these came two grades
very important to us as interesting historical types :—firid, the agri-
colae or mstici, who held land from year to year on payment of a
fixed rent, bat were from their tenure of those servile lands them
selves serfs       ;    and second, another class of serfs by whose                              forced
labour the chief or thane                  cultivated his demesne, and who were in
the strictest sense slaves.                  All    ancient systems          of society and of
tenure are tainted by this bane of slavery, but the Celtic system
seems to have been saturated with                         it,   and   it   is
                                                                           a    lurid light which
these two classes of serfdom throw on the expiring system of our
Celtic land            tenure,     a   light which, before       I     conclude,   I   will      seek to
throw into         some regions where           I   humbly think its illumination                   may
hn salutary.
      The whole framework of this Celtic tenure, with all its intricate
 arrangements of the clans and septs presenting an elaborate system of
 order and gradation, conforms but little with our notions of the
 freedom and breadth of the childhood                             of our race.        The Eastern
 influence     in the Celtic church                 is   unquestionable, and the church
exercised     a        paramount influence in forming the infant society of
 the    Celtic         race   ;   the same      hard and inexorable                rule, the same
 elaborate gradation, the same spirit of exclusiveness, and the same
 family pride which                 characterised        the Celtic church           as   it     expired
 before the more vigorous system                         of the Roman obedience                  charac
 terised the Celtic tribal development as                        it   too passed from the stage
 of     history.           Was     it    from    the      unchanging         East,        that    weird
 museum in which                    even   now      the worn          out theories         of human
 society seem preserved                 for our modern study, that the seeds of the
 disintegration            as well as the germs             of the development of Celtic
 society came          ?
       The records of Saxon tenure,                 if    in    some respects less interesting
 than those of Celtic holding, are at least less obscure and indistinct;
 and the labours of Freeman, Maine, and German inquirers, whose

108                      Proceedings       of the Royal      Society
researches      have been summarised with skill in an admirable paper
by Mr Morier,* have thrown                 a vast deal of       light on this subject.
It   is,   however, at   a   comparatively       late period of its development that
the Saxon tenure can have had much influence on our Scotch land,
at   a   period too when the orderly influences                of the Western church
had modified considerably               its original character, and had prepared
it   to receive with ready plasticity the more sharply defined features
of the Norman moidd.                   The unit of the Saxon system was the
" mark," which in analogy with Celtic and other Archaic systems
may be described as the heritage of the tribe.      Just as in the
Celtic tenure part of this mark was held jointly by the whole com
munity        as common pasturage or woodland                 ;   another section              was
divided into lots tilled by separate members of the community,                                  but
strictly according to fixed rule, and thrown open to common use so
soon as the crop was removed          third section was divided into
                                              ;
                                              a
small paddocks           or holdings immediately             adjoining the township.
There seems to have been from very early times separate ownership
in these last enclosures, and             a   separate   ownership also in the tillage
lands qualified by the common use of them for pasture after harvest.
     This system has often been referred to                as containing           the germ      of
that       co-operative system of           cultivation that commends itself to
many        in the present day         as the most advantageous.                  It   is   perhaps
somewhat fortunate that there have remained until                          a   comparatively
recent period traces of this system in both England and Scotland,
which enable          us to appreciate          its real   effects,   and to discern             its
appropriateness or the reverse to our modern life.                         One of the most
graphic instances of that survival we have thus recorded                           :   —
     " The two large      pieces of common land called Dolemoors,                       which lie
in the parishes of Congresbury, Week, St Lawrence, and Puxton in
Wiltshire, were allotted in the following manner. On the Saturday
preceding Midsummer day, o.s., the several proprietors (of the estates
having any right in these moors) or their tenants were summoned
at   a     certain hour in the morning, by the ringing of one of the hells
at Puxton, to repair to the church in order to see the chain (kept
for the purpose of laying out Dolemoors) measured   The proper

church, and extending it through the middle                 aisle, to the foot     of
the arch of     the west door under the tower, at each            of which places
marks were cot in the stones for that purpose.                The chain used for
this     purpose was only eighteen yards in length, consequently four
yards shorter than the regular land-measuring                 chain.     After the
chain had       been   properly     measured, the parties        repaired to the
commons.        Twenty-four apples         were   previously   prepared, bearing
the following marks, viz., fire marks called 'Pole-axes,' four ditto
'
   Crosses,'   two ditto 'Dung-forks, or Dung-pikes,'            one mark called
' Four Oxen and a Mare,' one ditto ' Two Pits,' one ditto ' Three
Pits,' one ditto ' Four Pits,' one ditto ' Five Pits,' one ditto ' Seven
Pits,' one ' Horn,' one ' Hare's-taiL' one ' Duck's-nest,' one ' Oven,'
one ' Shell,' one ' Evil,' and one ' Hand-reel.'
     " It is necessary    to 'observe that each of these moors was divided
 into several portions called furlongs, which              were   marked out by
 strong oak posts placed at regular distances from             each other, which
 posts were      constantly     kept up.      After the apples were properly
 prepared     they were put into a hat or bag, and certain persons fixed
 on for the purpose began to measure with the chain before-mentioned,
 and proceeded      till they had measured off          one acre    of ground    : at
  the end of which the boy who carried the hat or bag containing
  the marks took out one of the apples, and the mark which                     such
 apple bore was immediately cut in the turf with               a large knife kept
  for that purpose      ;   this knife   was    somewhat     in the    shape   of a
 scimitar with its        edge reversed.      In  this manner they proceeded
 till   the whole of the commons were laid out, and each proprietor
  knowing the mark and furlong which belonged to his                     estate,   he
  took possession of his allotment or allotments accordingly, for the
  ensuing    year.   An adjournment then took place to the house of
  one of the overseers,       where a certain number of acres reserved for
                                             and called the ' out-let
                                                                         '     '
  the purpose of paying          expenses,                                 or    out-
         '
  drift were let by inch of candle.
      " During the time of letting, the whole party were to keep silence
   (except the person who bid) under the penalty of one shilling.
   When any one wished to bid he named the price he would give
  and immediately      deposited     a shilling on the table where the candle
   stood, the next who bid also named his price and deposited his
   shilling in like manner, and the person who first bid was then to

110                             Proceedings        of the Royal   Society
take up his shilling.                     The business of letting thus                proceeded        till
the candle was burnt out, and the last bidder, prior to that event,
was declared the tenant of the outlet, or outdrif t for the ensuing year.
     " Two        overseers were annually elected from the proprietors or                         their
tenants.           A        quantity of strong ale or brown-stout was allowed for
                        '
the feast, or               revel,' as   it was called   ; also bread, butter, and cheese,
together with pipes and tobacco, of which any reputable person,
whose curiosity or casual business led him to Puxton on that day,
was at  liberty to partake, but he was expected to deposit at his
departure one shilling with the overseer by way of forfeit for his
intrusion.          The day was generally                   spent in sociality          and mirth,
frequently of a boisterous nature, from the exhilarating                                     effects    of
the brown-stout before alluded                      to."*
    But we have,                as   is well known, in our immediate vicinity in the
burgh of Lauder and at Newton of                       Ayr equally interesting survivals;
— that of Lauder especially, where                       105 burgess lots are held              under
a   charter        of         1502     renewing      more ancient        charters       which      had
perished, and conferring                     power on the burgesses              and community
to break up and plough                        their common lands.                 The possession
of one of these burgess acres or lots is essential to being                              a    burgess,
and     only       burgesses           are   members of        the Town           Council.        The
burgess acres consist of lots of from one and a half to three and
a   half       acres, but the burgh               holds besides a common of 1700 acres,
which is thus dealt with.                     Once in every five or seven years about
130 acres of the common is set off to be ploughed up and                                         culti
vated      ;    the part thus broken up is divided                 into        105 lots, and each
owner of a burgess acre is entitled                         to a lot which is determined
by lot.          On the rest of the moor such of tho                     105 burgesses         as are
residents pasture each fifteen sheep and two cows, and the widow                                       of
a   burgess pastures twelve sheep and one cow.                            Here then we have
tho Lauder burgess with his " homestead" in Lauder, his share of
the " arable mark" in his acres, and his share of the " pasture" and
" waste" in the moor; and we have the Council of Lauder prescrib
ing to         each burgess          the kind of cultivation      he is to pursue on the               lot
of the common land assigned to him.                         Somewhat similar tenures pre

  and the     system of   cultivation which this tenure prescribed — by which
  the holder of each lot had to conform to the general directions of
  the community         — prevailed widely in       the run rig system which was
  so largely the rule a hundred           years ago.      The parish of Smailholm
  was all cultivated       in that manner, and       at  Libberton in Lanarkshire,
  and many other places, this system of agriculture, testifying mani-
. festly to the prior existence of            some    quasi-communal      cultivation,
  may be distinctly identified.        +
      And there       are   some other traces      of a regulation     which reflects
  much light on the real nature of this tenure.                  At Newton      of  Ayr
  there were very special provisions as to the succession to a burgess ;
  and it not unfrequently           happened that as females were excluded,
  a  lot lapsed by        the  failure of an heir qualified to take it up            ;  it
  then reverted        to the Community,       which disposed of it to the most
  industrious and fit inhabitant            of the place.       This, if it could be
  traced     in other    cases, would    be most interesting, for it would          con
  nect this old Saxon tenure of ours very closely with its pristine
  origin in the distant past in the very cradle of mankind — showing
  as   it  does   that the tribe or commune was still the radical owner
  of the soil, and the tenure of individuals only accidental — and                  con
  necting     this tenure of the Lowland village with              those   tenures of
  Eastern and       some German types where the           right of pre-emption is re
  served to the community or its members,               and with that provision we
  are all familiar with, whereby at stated periods of jubilee the tribe re
  claimed its lust inheritance from private ownership, and the members
  of the tribe started afresh on         a fresh lease from their mother         tribe.J
      In  the rapid and necessarily very incomplete sketch which                I  have
  thus given        of the early tenures in this           country   there are some
  notable features which challenge             observation     in these  days.      The
  first of course is the trite but by no means unchallenged observation
  that the very origin and germ of progress and civilisation is the
  recognition of individual right.              Mankind in the mass remained
  inert and indolent        in the dim twilight of the earliest days          :  it was
  man that rose to       vigour and action and progress when he          asserted    his

individualism, and when the leaders of men, spurning the dead level
 of uniform stolidity, became the pioneers for their fellow-men.                 No
 progress  — no attempt    at progress  — is discernible during the dim ages
 when the land owned no separate title ; it was only when what for
 lack of  a  better word   I must    call selfishness contributed its ferment
 to the inert mass of humanity that the individual sporades developed
 that activity which we call progress, and of which the product                    is
civilisation.
    The second observation flows out of the first        : the cultivation of the
soil, though the oldest of the arts, is still an art itself of which the
basis is experience and the spirit is experiment.                Even with our
selves those who are the most proficient           in the art desire to free our
agriculture    from the trammels which seem to them to repress                  and
restrain its still nascent capacity       ;  the freedom of culture desired by
many is justified on the ground             that   successful  experiment      may
reveal fresh methods and more              adequate modes of culture.           But
under any conceivable modification             of the Saxon      tenure progress
was impossible,       because     experiment     was impossible      and change
impracticable.      The  same     uniform rule of culture had to be followed
in even the    separate tillage lota because all were interested      in the com
mon cultivation ; every one had to sow the same crop and to cultivate
it in the   same way, and the fields had to be cleared          for the common
pasture on the same day; much of the sluggishness of English agricul
ture may be distinctly traced to the surviving influences of that Saxon
tenure which imposed those fetters of iron custom on the cultivation
of the soil from        which hardly yet have English agriculturalists
emancipated themselves.           In  Scotland    the Board of Agriculture in
1798 say: — "In former times there            were several commons      in which
the cattle belonging        to different     proprietors   went    promiscuously
under one herd or keeper.            The arable land also      was   possessed    is
alternate ridges, separated       by broad balks, on which the large stone*
were when       the indolent     husbandman       could take that trouble, and
was pastured      by the cattle after being freed from the crops.           Lands
thus awkwardly possessed           and wretchedly      managed, might not im
properly be called wastes       ;  and though Acts of Parliament        passed    as
early as 1C95, for dividing at the instance of any proprietor having
interest, yet no advantage was taken of such beneficial laws               till the
 1738 or 1739, when the lands were parcelled out among the several
proprietors     in proportion to the valuation         or rate  by which they

paid the land tax."*         Nor where Celtic customs prevailed                  can we
discern any greater evidence of progress             :   we have few traces of how
the Highlands were cultivated in very ancient times, hut when we
first begin to acquire definite knowledge there is much to show that
the effect of the ancient tenures had been to arrest rather than pro
mote active and beneficial cultivation of the                 soil f Time will not
permit of my adducing detailed evidence of this— let me call one
witness,     no unfriendly one, to the past he reverenced or to the
Highlands he loved.          Cosmo Innes says, speaking of the rental in
1600 of the Gordon estates, which extended from Banff through the
heart of the country to the western sea                : — " In all that vast      estate
reaching from sea to sea, and across ranges of mountains now every
where pastured by sheep and cattle, there is no payment of wool or
woollen cloth, nor of hides or skins, nor any amount of                     sheep    and
cattle beyond      the occasional mart or wedder for the lord's table.
In    fact there were at that time no cattle or sheep                  reared in large
flocks and herds in our Highlands.             The       space and pasture were the
same as we know them now, but the thousands and millions of sheep
which graze them now had not yet taken possession.                              The first
introduction of large flocks of sheep into the Highlands was in the
last quarter of last century.           Gough the antiquary, writing            in 1780,
 says that    Mr Loch's    plans for introducing
                                                                              '
                                                          sheep had been attended
with     some success,'   and that the sheep promised to thrive very well
 in the Highlands.         But at this time (1600) there were nothing but
the petty flock of sheep or herd of a few milk cows grazed close
 round the farmhouse, and folded nightly for fear of the wolf or
 more cunning depredators."           {
    The third observation        I would    make is this, that the admiration
 and affection for these ancient tenures professed of late appears to
 be based on the idea that they were of a highly democratic and
 universalist type     ; there can be no greater mistake ; whether we take
 the Celtic sept and clan or tribe, or look at the Saxon community
 with its mark and its      gemote, we find a system of           rigid exclusiveness,
 an aristocracy in tenure, an oligarchy              in government.          There was

many.        The Celtic tribe was an exclusive corporation to which
birth within its own purple was as essential as it was at the
Court of the Empire             : the Saxon     freeholder was an aristocrat       of
the bluest        blood   — no     base  intruder was permitted to share the
privileges or the powers to which the freeholder alone was born —
it was oligarchy saturated with casta The essay in which Mr.
Freeman       identifies     the wittengemote, which has been to many the
type of popular self-government              by landowners of a common estate
with the House of Lords, not the House of Commons, forcibly
illustrates what        I  say ; but the case of Lauder illustrates it in a
startling though a more homely fashion.                   There there are 105 free
men, and they have successfully resisted the claims of the profane
vulgar of that august city to participate                 in their privileges: one
would regret that anything should happen to shatter so interesting
a petrefaction        and crystallisation      of ancient tenure, but a tenure
which maintains           an exclusive right of 105 persons to appropriate
the ancient common property of the " gemote is not what

designate as a peculiarly popular system ;               it is most interesting that
those    village     aristocrats     should   share the arable mark        and feed
their fifteen     sheep     apiece on the common waste          of Saxon tenure, as
their fathers did in the time of the Maid of Norway ; but though
history would         have lost a graphic illustration it would not seem to
me that humanity           would have suffered an irremediable loss had the
common estate of Lauder assimilated                 itself to modem tenure and
been devoted          to the      homely   function     of bringing in water and
clearing out the sewage of that ancient, not to say archaic burgh,
even   if in    the process individual had taken the place of communal
right.
    It is seven centuries since these ancient systems we have been
 considering have exercised any direct or practical control over th*
tenure of the land in which we live, seven                  centuries full of change
aud of incident, powerful             enough even     if compressed into    a briefer
period to have severed any connection                which the active life of the
present day could have had with the defunct systems of an almost
prehistoric      age,     ISut while no doubt much pedantry and affecta
tion have been of late exhibited             in the attempt to ascribe to those
archaic systems an influence on our modern institutions which it

L>   impossible    for the real student to recognise or admit, still we
must bear in mind that those feelings and sentiments which affect
the relation of man to his mother earth are deep enough to permit
the roots of society to sink into them far below the stage on which
the prominent drama of history is enacted ; that relation underlies
the    very framework        of society itself,     and   systems which have
regulated the relation of man to the earth which bears him and
feeds him continue to exercise a powerful influence over his imagina
tion and feelings long after they have         ceased to operate on the actual
circumstances of his outward life.            Nor from the analogy of other
sciences need we be surprised        if this recent stirring of  these substrata
of our early society gives birth to strange efforts to revert to ancient
types; these efforts       are no doubt      due rather to individual eccen
tricity than to general conviction, just        as in nature we find occasional
specimens of highly developed species             which exhibit    a sportive   in
clination to revert to primeval types from which lengthened cultiva
 tion has really far removed the whole          class to which they belong.
     There   are, however, not a few side lights       which the fitful gleams
 we get    in studying   these ancient types of society may throw into the
 origin and pristine circumstances of those relations which subsist
 in our own day.        For instance, the theory of rent most acceptable
 to modem economy and most consonant with modern circumstances
 is that which      represents the rent as the share falling to the land
 owner of the profits of           a   quasi-partnership,    to the capital      of
 which the owner contributes his land and the tenant bis stock, his
 labour, and his skill.        Very ancient       types of society justify     this
  theory, and    in many parts of Europe more subject to Latin influ
 ences than we have been it survives in the metayer systems which
  prevail ; but it is on the whole a modern development, and bears
  abundant     evidence of its origin      in  a state   of society much more
  cultivated than any of those we have been considering.              The rent of
  our ancient tenures was originally in the main personal service, and
  even when     it began to    assume    the form of money payment          it was
  a pecuniary substitution      for such services or for that direct mainten
  ance   in bed and board which the king or the chief exacted            ; and    it
  was always fixed      and definite, bearing no necessary relation to the
   value  of the land.     The foundation of our ancient relation between
   landlord   and tenant was not,      I  apprehend, partnership but sale ; a
   tenant did not share      the produce with his landlord, he bought the

116                    Proceedings        of the Royal Society
temporary use of his farm for              a certain   price payable by instalments
during the lease       ;   he was more a temporary feuar, or a copy holder,
than   a   tenant in our sense of the term.                 And herein lies          a very
important        and curious        distinction     between ancient and modern
economy,       which is the key to many difficulties              ;  with    us, the price
of an article and its value are almost convertible                    terms, but      it was
not so of old, it was not so not very long                  ago.      Price, was   fixed in
the ancient times          I  speak    of by custom,       and when we           read with
wonder of statesmen             in even modern times seeking to fix the price
of viands by enactment               they were only struggling with the idea
which in pristine societies fixed price by inveterate custom.                          Even
now in India there are districts where the price of shoos for instance
is fixed by inviolate custom, and the shoemakers                    adapt themselves to
circumstances      not by altering the price but by modifying the quality
of their goods       ;  and not very long ago in some European countries
the price of the loaf was fixed and its dimensions fluctuated.
    Now in England            we know that the rent of the land has not even
yet borne the same intimate relation                   to its value       it has done      in
Scotland     ;  the rent which a man's father and grandfather paid before
him has lingered there              as   an   almost customary rent different              in
degree rather than          in principle from      the really customary         rent of the
copyhold tenure          ; and    the commercial principle           which our modern
practice     especially in Scotland             has   introduced      of close identity
between      value and price has in England               penetrated      with the slow
ness proverbial to agriculture into the relations bearing on land.                          I
think    there may bo some of the unsolved problems of this                         relation
upon which the consideration of what                   I have    thus referred to may
throw    a  little light.
   Another ancient fact bearing on the landlord                      and tenant of our
modern      experience seems worthy of some note ; the pristine form of
 that relation was,       as  I have   already shown, of an alternative character.
The tenancy might be one practically of sleelbow, in which the land
lord supplied stock, implements, and the scanty housing                       if any ; or it
might be that by which the landlord sold temporarily the use of hi»
land only, leaving the tenant                to supply     himself with all that he
required for its cultivation.               It  was this latter form mainly              that
survived into later times.              Wo    have of course no written leases re
maining to us of the very early times to which                   I  have been specially
referring    ;  but those early leases which do remain entered into at                      a

                       of Edinburgh,         Session 1882-83.                      117
date when owing to the inveterate habits of a rural people, the main
features of the early contract must have survived, the stipulation
that the tenant should supply the houses, &c, required for the proper
cultivation of the farm is to be found. In a lease, for instance, so
early as 1312* it       was stipulated       that the tenant should supply suit
able buildings for himself and his husbandmen, which were to                        be
left at the end of the      lease   ; after an interval of two centuries, under
the next earliest    lease  of which haveI       seen any note,   in  1511  the tenant
is taken bound to build three oris toads to           be inhabited by himself and
his dependants under pain of forfeiture ;             a crofter is taken bound to
build a rood of enclosure for every cow he has on the lands of                     the
principal tenant ; and in two          cases tenants were taken bound to         build
houses on their farms, but were allowed to retain               a part of their rents
to assist them in doing         so.     These were church lands, and we may
 be sure these stipulations          represent nothing      more     severe  than the
 usual tenure, but probably the reverse.                Now such a system was
 quite consistent with the idea of a partial or temporary sale of
 the subject, which was the           bare    land, not as in steelbow the land
 equipped with stock and appliances of which                 the wattled houses     of
 these early days formed probably no very important part                  ; but it was
 quite inconsistent with the        more developed ideas       of modern economy
 basing     the lease on quasi-partnership,         and was not suited for our
 modern use with the more important outlays now required for modern
 agriculture.     It is well, however, to discern from these examples that
 the principle now universally           recognised as the best, which imposes
 on the modern landlord the necessity of supplying all that is required
 for the full equipment and beneficial cultivation of the farm, or of
  recouping to the tenant what he may dispense for such purposes, is no
  exhumation, as has been often represented,           of ancient custom or tenure
  — no reverting to    a more generous system long forgotten.               Antiquity
  knew nothing of the kind, or            if the steelbow form of lease is to be
  taken as the archaic type of what is advocated, then the experience
  of seven centuries and the advance in independence of the agricul
  tural class have demonstrated that that system is unsuitable, for it
  has  failed to survive.      It may be less interesting but it is certainly
  safer,  instead   of   searching for principles         and precedents for our
  present guidance among the archaic systems of the past, to recognise
  that even the highest forms of these were datum lines from which to

history of progressive emancipation ; to represent the changes neces
sary to adapt it to our advance in economic science and social de
velopment as a process of reverting to the spirit of ancient practice
is to subvert the teaching of history;                    it is to the progress, not the
retrogression of ideas on this as on other topics that we have                                          to
ascribe the advance we have made and are making                             ;    it is what is most
fit for our modern life that survives, not what may be most interest

     No section of the inquiry into the relation of man to the soil is
so     difficult of solution         as that     which relates to the poor, and none
to us of the present day is more interesting.                              If,    as seems      to be
thought by many, there were days in this land in which the poor
were not always with us, no wonder                          longing       glances are thrown
backward to catch even amidst the darkness of barbarism glimpses
of so happy a condition.                  But    a closer study     of the facts dispels the
illusion      ;    besides the abnormal growth of population                          to which the
Duke of Argyll referred in                  a recent essay                      is,   in my humble

days to which we have been referring were ignorant of poverty,                                     was
greatly due to those facts, that slavery held its place in their economy,
and that the habits of all classes of the people rendered them to                                       a
large extent independent of external supply                       — they were largely self-
sufficing.
     The nature of the slavery of                these remote times         it    is   very difficult
accurately to distinguish             ;   it   was certainly of at least two distinct
forms.            There were the serfs, the naiivi, probably the descendant*
of an ancient               race, often   the members of tribes which had been
subjugated by strongor neighbours, always attached to the land, and
not     apparently           removable      from    it   even     with their assent, and
almost,       certainly not without it.              These serfs were slaves                 in this
respect that they had neither                  in the Celtic nor     in   the Saxon economy
any rights; but         if     the land held so tight       a   grip on them, they in turn
held    a   tight grip on the land, and                  had certainly           claims on their
lord     or       owner, though       whether       these       claims     were those of               an

inherent right to support or proceeded merely from              the self interest
of the lord himself in the preservation of his property, it is very
difficult to say.
    But below     these    there was      a  class of slaves    who   were mere
personal     property ; probably orignally captives of war, but latterly
in many instances freemen who had               been reduced to want, and who
sold themselves       as a  condition of receiving maintenance and pro-
section from the powerful and rich ; and this sale affected their
posterity.
    While there    seems very     little doubt that the position of the pre
dial serfs    even   if  originally equivalent to that of slavery becamp
latterly a mere form of tenure of service, and that they had probably
to endure none of the degradation of positive slavery, there can be no
doubt that it was not       so  with the other     class.  Theirs was a slavery
from which men fled in horror, and to which they were dragged
back in terror and in chains.           The early Acts of Parliament abound
with evidence of this and with directions for the recovery of fugi
tives, and even      in the 14th century slaves were recaptured, and
handed back to their owners under sanction of the law.
    These were the poor of the ancient tenures, and we can readily
discern why they were so largely dependent on the lords of the soil
for maintenance and       defence ; their gradual emancipation from actual
serfdom     or slavery followed       insensibly   on the development of the
church and the progress of society, but their dependence on the chief
or lord continued, and while they swelled the train of his followers
they looked to him for support.             This was   a burden  which speedily
began to press on the chiefs in the Highlands, and although plague,
pestilence, and famine came largely to their relief, the growth of the
population impelled them insensibly into that turbulence and rest
lessness which distinguish the annals of our Highland life ; it is not
perhaps so picturesque as one would wish to ascribe the frequency
and the fierceness of Celtic feuds to the mean                necessities of the
larder, but these economic forces were too powerful to be ignored
 in any veritable history of the        clans.
    It  is very interesting    to those who study these ancient forms of
 life to find extant, or only recently extinct, forms of society         possess
 ing all the main features which we have reason to beliove character
 ised these early days in our own country.              The practical experience

scholars who have applied their knowledge of the Aryan races                         in
India to the elucidation        of our Scotch archaic history has thrown
much light on the subject; but                 I  think   a speech made        a   few
weeks ago by       Dr Hunter in the council of the viceroy on the
treatment of the people of the Deccan is singularly illustrative of
the subject I am now treating.                " The peasantry of the Deccan,"
he said, "have been suffering from economic causes sufficient                         to
break the spirits and to ruin the fortunes of any race.                 Seventy-four
years ago, when         the Mahrattas       and the peasantry of the Deccan
passed under our Government,             they had five great sources of         liveli
hood.       The economic and political changes brought                      about    by
 British rule have deprived them of four of                these    sources   and left
 them only one.        In  the first place, the Mahratta           race had,   during
 nearly two centuries, derived         a large,   although a fluctuating, income
 from war.       Its pillaging invasions           of wealthier      provinces    were
 reduced to a system of strictly mercantile adventure, which enriched
 alike the fort of the chief and the           cottage  of the   peasant.     For the
 Deccan hordes were not the accidental product of any single leader,
 but the natural result of an overflowing              peasant population       under
 the guidance of a hereditary administrative             caste."    I thought I     had
 read this before, and turning          to Cosmo Innes's charming essays on
  our early Scotch life,     I found     this  : — " The   power of the chief or
  laird  was measured     by the number of men he could turn out under
  arms, and he had every inducement to maintain                 the   full number of
  dwellings and inhabitants.          In summer      the people of the glen might
  exist upon the produce of their pasture lands, and there was a                  little
  corn for the beginning of winter, but for the rest of the year they
  must necessarily have sought sustenance elsewhere.                     They could
  not dig, to beg they were ashamed               There was a tliird alternative,
  they left their glens and lifted:"*
     Dr Hunter      goes   on to show how the advance of civilisation
 has dried up the sources      of the former wealth and even subsistence of
 the Deccan peasantry, and we could tell the same story of our own
 land  ;  the looms of Galashiels         and Hawick have silenced those in
 the  Highland glens, and all the manifold             changes    that railways and
 steamers    have introduced       into the habits of a people formerly so
 self-contained    and self-sufficing      have conduced to the reduction             of

the value of such labour as the Highlands supplied                    Lassalle and
Kail Marx in their       crusade against modern plutocracy have depicted
with great force and skill the vast difference which there is between
a system of society which is content to supply only its own
necessities from day to day and that high pressure of modern life,
which, stimulated by capital ever             eager and  hungry for gain, manu
factures    on speculation, and anticipates demand by an ever-ready
and often over-abundant          supply.       Lassalle, speaking of the feudal
lord     of   Germany,
                                      "
                            says : — Look upon the             landed     proprietor
during the middle ages, the noble lord surrounded by his castles,
his     manors,    his   vassals,     serfs,    and   dependants,     his    allodial
villages and tributary towns.              Was this man      a    capitalist?     Let
 no    one   suppose   that people       lived on the produce          of the land
 only,    which is     the   crude     notion     of some   people.     Production
 was sufficiently     developed, luxury          considerable,   and the articles
 of consumption      manifold     and refined."       He then proceeds       to give
 from     mediaeval    writings    a description      of prevailing     fashions in
 wearing apparel, furniture,          and the like, showing         the    advanced
 state of fashionable society then and its varied requirements.                   He
 shows how all these are provided              by the combined contribution         of
                                         " mosaic work of services."          Under
 vassalage, by what he calls a
 this system man is no longer             a slave,   but his will is    the private
 property of another. There is an exchange of services and natural
 products without the intervention of money as a general measure of
 value.
            " The  acres  of the feudal lord" he points out "are cultivated
 not only by serfs but with         the help     of man and    beast, by   means    of
 villenage more or less reasonable           in extent, varying from three days
 in the week to five or six weeks in the year, according to the
 position of the feudal dependant."              Then again, he says, " put your
 self in imagination back to one of the days for collecting the yearly
 revenue, when the feudal lord receives his dues.               Then you     will  see
 heaps of corn and barley, chicken and bacon, oxen and swine, eggs
 and butter, oil, fruits, wax, candles, honey, yea even cakes, bouquets,
 and chapeaux de rose, all contributed by his faithful lieges.                   The
  tailors and shoemakers of the small town under his protectorate, re
  membering the principle nvlle terre sans seigneur, bring their clothes
  and shoes which have been made during the week's service they owe

  who are bound to contribute             their respective portion        of the lord's
  requirements in natural or manufactured              goods ; and       a long inven
  tory of services rendered to his household by their wives and others
  belonging    to them follows, all to show           "  that scarcely     a want can
  be conceived    which is not provided for by              some special     obligation
  in this system of natural            services.   Evon professional men like
  advocates   must give their advice as a duty,               free of charge,     to the
  lord of the manor.       His amusements even            are provided     for him by
  his own dependants free of charge.             He is    a wealthy man,       without
  the possession   of money     ;  for ho cannot turn        these services     or com
  modities into capital        He avails himself with             a vengeance     of all
  those   means   of enjoyment whioh are thrown with such profusion
 around him, and he does it cheerfully without care or worry, and
 thus is more happy than the rioh speculator of modern days whose
 tranquil enjoyment may           be disturbed     by   a passing thought         about
 the   money market        as he     listens   to the music of Beethoven              or
 Mozart.     But beyond consuming with enjoyment the feudal lord
 has nothing.      He has no       means     to multiply his wealth by itself ;
 not money but service was the common bond uniting all the mem
 bers   of the empire among themselves and under                 a common head.
     " By this system of fixed services and mutual obligations no room
 is loft for capitalistic enterprise or industrial progress,           the whole pro
 cess  of production     receives    a stereotyped form, agriculture and the
 trades run on without change in the same groove."                   *
     The Highland chief of old lived very much               as, Lassallo so     pictur
 esquely points out, the old feudal lords lived,               if  upon their people,
yet with them and among them ; they supplied all his wants, and
these    supplies and their personal services fulfilled all their obliga
tions.     The people had no money, and they needed none ; they paid
their rent in kind or by service, their necessities were few, and their
commerce      had not risen above the rudimentary                 stage of exchange ;
the chief had no money wherewith               to import     foreign commodities,
and he lived in the rude plenty which his people supplied                      ;  when
his supplies failed we know how they were replenished.                       All  these
influences have told on the poorer class in the Highlands especially,
and    it is interesting and may           be useful to     inquire     how   modern
economy has coped with              the difficulties     presented to      it by the
extinction of ancient habits and resources.

                     of Edinburgh,      Session 1882-83.                        12.1
    To translate the serf and the slave of ancient life into modern
language,    I would    use the    word  " dependant     "
                                                            ; that  I  think con
veys more of the spirit of the ancient relation with its mutual ser
vice and protection than the terms of slave and serf, which                 convey
a   harsher meaning than probably describes the true nature of the
tie which bound the earliest predecessors              of the chiefs to those
below them.      Now, in our modern life, how has this relation adapted
itself to modern systems ? The chief, though deprived of tho ser
vices of his dependants, has been forced to maintain                  and protect
them; not in the grand patriarchal            manner of ancient times, and
with none of their pomp and panoply of war, and with none of their
keen zest for raids and marauds ; he has to pay poor rates.                     But
translated into the vernacular of our modern life he has no light
burden thus to defray.        I have taken    ten parishes in Inverness, and
eight in Boss, of which the gross rental in the one case is £58,000,
in the other £64,000; of the £58,000 in Inverness,                    £15,800 is
paid by tenants under        £10; of the £64,000 in Boss, £17,500 is
paid by tenants of the same class.          The poor      rates paid    in the ten
 Inverness    parishes amount to £6200, in the eight Boss parishes
to £8300.       I   cannot   state  accurately     the school rate,       but    one
of the inspectors      in his last report    says   it varios in    one of these
 districts from 2s. to 6s. 8d. per     £.     I   have taken it at the lowest
amount, and we have thus in the Inverness                group an assessment
 of £12,000, and a rental under £10 of £15,800               ; in the Boss-shire
group an assessment        of £14,700 a rental under £10 of £17,500.
 Now    I cannot here attempt to determine what precise                proportion
 of that assessment      is due to the special necessities of the small
 tenants under £10, but everyone         will admit it must be very           large.
 For the maintenance and education of the poor in                 these   districts
 the land has to pay annually         about 90 per cent,         of the nominal
 rental under £10, and        a  proportion    of course     very much greater
 of the real rental actually drawn.        It   is safe to say that more than
 the whole rental under £10 is required to defray the expense of
  maintaining and educating the poor.         It  can  hardly therefore     be said
  that the survival of the relation between the land and the poor from
  ancient times,  if it has been in many respects painful to those who
  were the dependants of the old chiefs, has been favourable to the
  successors of the chiefs    themselves— the fathers no doubt ate sour

grapes       in the olden time, and the teeth of the children have been
set very much on edge                  by the operation.
      But the landlords           are not the only survivals           of those on whom
the poor of the ancient                  times were dependent;            as stated     by   Mr
lanes, and as illustrated by many                   a   stirring tale of old, others besides
the landlords were made to contribute to the necessities of the noble
peasantry of the glens.                 When in 1856 and in other            years, as   now.
the successors          of the douce provosts of olden times invite us to
contribute to relieve the urgent necessities of the suffering Highland
poor, they are only putting into modern language the levy their
predecessors          would have made             upon us to pay the black mail the
clans would have exacted when their domestic means of subsistence
failed, as they have done.           At no time within modern history, since
population began           to grow beyond very narrow limits, have several of
the poorer districts of the Highlands been able to supply their own
needs ; there has never been                    a time when the plenty       of   one   period
has there sufficed to meet the scarcity of another;                       whother the levy
has been by war, or by tax, or by charity, extraneous aid has always
had to contribute           its quota.           As the Duke of Argyll recently
                                                                              has
reminded us,          nature in old times, when population outgrew its bound*,
asserted       her inexorable            laws    by sending      plague, pestilence,         and
famine to clear off the surplus ; our modern civilisation has curbed
these       powers, as well as repressed                the social characteristics      which
accompanied and assisted them, and thus                           is presented to us the
same        problem, though within far narrower limits, which is pressini;
on the Government of India — the growth of a population at a rate
far    in    excess    of that in ancient times, bringing on our modern
economy and social science burdens due to their own beneficence
      The suggestion so frequently                made of late that the poorer cottars
and crofters of the Highlands are the inheritors                          of ancient tribal
rights in the land          is,   as
                                   I     have already shown, quite fallacious           ;    the
relation of dependence in which that class unquestionably                           stood not
only in feudal times to the later lords and chiefs, but in still earlier
days to the original          freeholders of the tribal             organisation, did not
permit of their having any rights                  ;    the exclusive system of the tribe,
the restriction of all rights to the freemen, forbid the possibility nf
any rights in the land having been held by those who were                               below
that rank      ;   and there can be no doubt that the freemen of the tribe

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1882-83.                           125
grew into the chiefs and the lairds, the feuars and kindly tenants of
later days,       of -whom    the cottars and crofters are in no sense repre
sentatives.        Here, again,    I would   point out how dangerous         it is to
refer to analogies in those early days without due care in establish
ing their identity with the modern circumstances they are intended
to illustrate.       It  is a safer course     to let these    dead systems bury
their   dead — and      to apply ourselves to the careful study of our own
social problems by the brighter light of our own social progress.                  In
that light      it humbly appears to       me that the frequent       recurrence of
Highland distress is         a reproach on our modem economy from              which
ancient systems were free, however that freedom was obtained.                       It
is foreign      to the subject of which         I treat to pursue this subject,
but this     I   may say, that dealing with people who have been for
ages   habituated      to be led, to be dependent     for guidance on others, tu
be protected by others, who are only emancipated but not yet free,
if our modern system is to fulfil the duties it has inherited from
 the past,    it must supply that initiation and guidance and motive
 power and influence which of old, under very different circumstances
 and   in very different directions, the chiefs of         these people supplied      :
 to parody a      well-known aphorism, relief is no cure         : it is the proper
 task   of modern economy        to show these people the method, to induce
 them    to adopt the measures,          and even to supply        them with the
 means     to  win that independence which is            a  nobler, and   will  be a
 more useful       inheritance    than any that they claim from the distant
 past.
    1  had intended to say something as to the taxation                on the land
 of these ancient days and its relation           to our modern imposts, but         I
 have already far exceeded         the limits of my paper and must conclude.
 I  have    fulfilled my purpose       if  I  have directed attention        to, and
 created any interest in, the salient features          of those ancient tenures
 which are in any way reflected in our present social system                ;  and  if
  I have   succeeded     in demonstrating that after all it is more       as studies
  and as cabinet specimens than as models that we must regard them ;
  that they were only the nurseries of society, not even its schools                  ;
  interesting     and    picturesque    no   doubt,   attractive   but deceptive,
  festooned    with the       mosses  and encrusted with the lichens             that
  adorn the decay      while they conceal the defects of hoar antiquity.

          Chakles Darwin.          By Professor Cossar Ewart.
    Charles Robert Darwin, who was tho eon of Dr.             R   W. Darwin,
and    grandson     of the distinguished      Dr. Erasmus       Darwin, was
born    at Shrewsbury on February 12, 1809.               His mother was      a
daughter of    Josiah  "Wedgwood.      Of his early life little is at present
known.       For   a time he attended      the school     at Shrewsbury,     of
which Dr. Butler, afterwards Bishop of Lichfield, was              master.   It
having been decided that he should study medicine, he was at the
age   of sixteen (1825) sent to the University of Edinburgh. After
two sessions at Edinburgh, he gave up the study of medicine, and
entered     Christ's  College,   Cambiidge,    to  study    for the Church.
While in Edinburgh Mr. Darwin          seems to have directed       his atten
 tion chiefly to botany       and  natural   history.    During his second
session    (1826-27)    he  became a member      of the University Plinean
 Society, and, as the MS. records testify, took part in its discus
 sions, and read before    it at least two   papers.     One of these papers
 referred to the ova of Flustra, the other pointed out thai the small
 black globular body hitherto        mistaken   for   the Fucus    lor was in
 reality the ovum     of the Pontobdella    muricata.     These papers     pro
 bably contained the results of Mr. Darwin's earliest scientific obser
  vations.    At   a subsequent    meeting of tho Society        he presented
  "             of Pontobdella muricata ova and young."

     After  the usual   course  at Cambridge, Mr. Darwin obtained the
  B.A   degree  in 1831, and in 1837 he was promoted to the             degree
  of  MA      Already an entomologist, on entering Cambridge he soon
  became    acquainted    with the distinguished        naturalist   Professor
   Henslow.    Judging from letters published, Professor Henslow         seems
                                                                      a

                                        •7
more than any other to have been instrumental               in leading    Mr.
Darwin to take       a deep    interest  in natural science  ; and  not only
to have ably assisted and advised          him in his pursuits, but to have
gained his life-long      admiration    and esteem.    Further, we are in
debted to Professor Henslow         for urging Mr. Darwin (notwithstand
ing the objections offered that it might unsettle him for the Church)
to accompany Captain Fitzroy in the "Beagle," — a voyage in which
we cannot but feel great interest, not only because of the enormous
work Mr. Darwin accomplished single-handed, but more especially
becauso    it was during this voyage that the great generalisations oc
curred to him which will ever be associated with his name, and which
mark a new epoch in biology, and have had a more profound influ
ence on science than any other doctrines ever published.
    Three    years after returning from his voyage round the world,
Mr. Darwin married, and in 1842 settled at Down, in Kent, where
he remained living the quiet life of a country gentleman            until his
death on the 19th of       April last.
    Mr. Darwin     was   elected an ilonorary Fellow of the Society in
 1865.
    Of Mr. Darwin's work, the influence it has already had, and            the
influence it is likely to have in time to come, it is almost impossible
to form any estimate,       and still more difficult is it for us to realise
 his   personal   character,    and   the loss we have sustained      in his
death ; for however great he was as a worker, he was still greater
as a man.        We have only to be reminded of the wonderful          mani
 festations of reverence and regard which followed the announcement
 of his death, to understand how universal has been his influence,
 and how keenly his work has been everywhere appreciated.                   A*
 has been well said, in the " memorial notices," his wholly irreparable
 loss is " not merely because of his wonderfully genial, simple, anJ
 generous nature, his cheerful and animated conversation,            and the
 infinite variety and accuracy of his information,          but because    the
 more one knew of him, the more he seemed the incorporated ideal
 of a man of science ; " and that it was not his great reasoning
 powers, vast knowledge, and tenacious industry          "which impressed
 those who were admitted to his intimacy with involuntary venera
 tion,   but   a  certain intense    almost passionate honesty     by which
 nil his thoughts and actions        were  irradiated as by  a central fire

                                                3
and again, that his " character                was    chiefly marked       by a certain
grand and cheerful simplicity, strangely and beautifully united with
a deep and thoughtful wisdom, which, together with his illimitable
kindness      to others, and complete forgetfulness               of himself, made        a
combination       as loveable as      it was venerable."
    When we consider Mr. Darwin's work, we                     are led to regard       him
as one    of the most fortunate            and successful observers of natural
phenomena, and as the greatest               generaliser in the whole history of
biology   j and further, we            are impressed       with the great influence
his generalisations have had on all other sciences.
    What, hi      a few words,         may be said to be Mr. Darwin's great
work   1    It  is not that he first propounded the theory of evolution,
nor so much that, taking              into consideration heredity, the struggle
for existence, and the survival of the fittest, he hit upon the idea
of natural selection, as that by undertaking                elaborate investigations,
by collecting       facts from every possible source,              and by pondering
over and testing his conclusions again and again, he was able, after
many years of patient industry, to publish an all but complete proof
of evolution.        He has thus not only increased our knowledge, but,
by establishing         a   new    principle,      has completely        revolutionised
biology, introduced          order where there was confusion, and laid new
foundations       on which naturalists            are   raising   a  fair and comely
edifice,  which will form the             best   and most lasting monument               of
the great philosopher         of the nineteenth century.
    So familiar are we all with               Mr. Darwin's writings, that it is
scarcely   necessary to do more than mention                  some of the more         im
portant ones.         First of all, one naturally thinks of that mine of
wealth to the naturalist,           the Origin       of  Species,  in which we have
condensed into an            exceedingly     small     compass      facts   enough for
a   dozen volumes         ;    yet    notwithstanding          the    great    condensa
tion manifested        throughout        this book, the        reasoning     is evident
from     beginning       to    end,    and    the     conclusions      stand    unassail
able.    It   reads as      if it   were the epitome          of   a whole      series   of
works which the author               had intended         to write,    and for which
 material had been collected, rather than as an introduction;                           an
 epitome, however, so complete and suggestive                   in itself that, like      a
 picked army,      it was able to fight its way           so effectively, that     it was
 found to be practically            unnecessary to fall back upon the vast

                                                     4
reserves which had been accumulated in order to support by detailed
evidence the new doctrines.                     Hence, after publishing The Variation*
of Plants and Animals under Domestication, Mr. Darwin was again
able to turn to Nature, not so much now for evidence of his theory,
as by applying the principle of natural selection to point out how
hitherto obscure problems might be explained.
     In the Variation of Animals and Plants, and in the Expression
of    the Emotions           in Man and Animals,                  we have             further evidence
of Mr. Darwin's enormous power of work, his faculty for collecting
and arranging facts, and of the remarkable ability he possessed of draw
ing from them conclusions which indicated a wonderful insight into
the secrets of nature.              Further, in all of these works, as also                          in the
Origin of        Species, we have numerous observations of great                                    impor
tance and interest,            which mark out Mr. Darwin                             at once as an able
and careful investigator              ;    but his fitness for pure zoological work is
still more evident when we turn to the Naturalist's Voyage Rourvl
the     World,     and to         the Monographs              on          the    Cirripedia,         Those
familiar     with      the    elaborate         memoirs on tho Cirripedia, must feel
that Mr. Darwin was                   as    capable      of prosecuting purely morpho
logical work       as he was          in performing          physiological experiments, or
of working          out       philosophical          problems,             and that although his
zoological investigations                 are    thrown      into         the    background         by his
profound         generalisations,           they     are     of      themselves              of   sufficient
importance to entitle him to rank with the greatest biologists of any
age.
      What   has been          said of Mr. Darwin                 as       a    zoologist, may almost
with     equal propriety be said                of him     as a   botanist and geologist                 To
quote again from tho "memorial                        notices       :"•—¦" It        is   not too much to
say that each of              his   botanical         investigations,             taken on its own
merits, would           alone have made the reputation                                of    any ordinary
botanist."        Most of his investigations on plants were communicated
to the Linnean            Society, and then published                           in   a     collected form.

table Kingdom,           was      published in 187G, and in the following                              year
appeared     the       results of his work On the Different Forms of Floirers

Plants        ;   and also the       well-known           treatise       on Insectivorous Plants.
We        perhaps         leam      best     the influence              of Mr.      Darwin's       work
on     botanical          science     when      we        compare         the     ideas     held as to
the distribution             of plants         before       and after            the publication         of
the      Origin         of Species.          Previously,           it    was     generally    believed
that      the       different      species and            genera         were     special    creations,
and that the regions             in which the         same forms occurred being similar,
had led           to the creation of similar plants.                           This theory entirely
failed       to account         for the      appearance          of similar plants in regions
which had nothing in common in their physical conditions, and
for their absence from places where the conditions were similar;
whereas,    pointed out by Sir Joseph Hooker, by adopting Mr.
                  as
Darwin's theory, " The theory of the modification of species after
migration and isolation, their appearance                                 in distant localities is
only     a   question of time and changed physical conditions."
     Mr. Darwin's geological work                         was    chiefly the outcome              of his
voyage in the            " Beagle."      The most important of these is the masterly
treatise On the Structure and Distribution                              of Coral   Reefs.     As with
zoology           and botany,       however, his generalisations have                        had more
influence          than    his special investigations.                    About the time when
advanced           geologists       were     beginning          to feel       that the old notions
about        fossils      utterly failed       to     account           for     the distribution        of
organisms              in the rocks, they            were       startled        with the announce
ment         of the theory          of     natural     selection,         and      soon    deeply im
pressed        with the fact insisted on by Mr. Darwin, that the                                       geo
logical       record was still very imperfect. Just as this theory                                     has
hurried on             by leaps and bounds the study of embryology,                          so   it   has
given a           mighty impulse           to palaeontology.                  Having no longer          to
 battle over what            is,   or what     is    not,   a    species,       paheontologists are
now vieing             with embryologists in working out the ancestral history
 of organisms.             The work of Professor Marsh alone amply testifies
as to the success           of these investigations.                Not the       least important of
Mr. Darwin's works, from                 a   geological point of view,             is   his treatise on
 Vegetable         Mould and Earthworms.                    A paper " On             the Formation
 of    Mould"          was read at the Geological                  Society in 1840.               After
more      than forty         years, during           which period               he made     numerous
additional          observations and experiments, his book on Earthworms
 made        its appearance — this, with the exception of two papers, read

                                       6
before the Linnean Society shortly before his death, being his last
work.
   We might now indicate what'influence Mr. Darwin has had on
mental and other sciences : how that, through his general nobility
of character, and his moral attributes rising pre-eminently above his
intellect,    he has been     able to effect the     greatest   revolution of
modern times without creating more than a passing show of strife
and    bitterness    :  and how all his work was accomplished            under
physical     difficulties which an ordinary man would        have  considered
excuse enough          to regard  himself   as  a  confirmed    and   helpless
invalid   ; but feeling intensely   how difficult it is to express in words
what one feels regarding Mr. Darwin, we shall refrain from saying
more.      Those who knew the chaotic condition to which Biology
had been reduced before the appearance          of the Origin    of Spirits in
the memorable year of 1859, and who have had the opportunity of
observing order take the place of confusion, and light that of dark
ness, can best testify to the mighty influence        of Mr. Darwin and      to
the Iors the cause of science has sustained in his death.       As we lament
our loss, let us however remember that, in one sense, the hero so
many of us worshipped is still with us, and that he lived to see his
great life-work completed and        justly appreciated in all parts of the
civilised world.                                       J. Cossar Ewart.
 Emile Plantamour.             By the Astronomer Koyal for Scotland.
    On September 7th of the present year, at the          age of 67, died our
 Foreign    Associate, Emile Plantamour,       director of the Observatory
of Geneva, and professor of both            astronomy and       physical   geo
graphy in the university of the same city.
    Victim     at last to a sudden   accession   of consumptive disease, he
died in     full possession of his admirable mental faculties, and           as
 universally regretted      as he had lived    generally respected, not only
 in his own, but in every other country where science is known and
civilisation appreciated ; for well had he exhibited throughout his
 whole career how much of kindly goodness,           as  well  as intellectual
 ability,  does so often characterise those who are snatched out        of this
 world immaturely by that insatiable malady of the lungs.

    Bom     on the 14th   of May 1815 in Geneva — a year after his little
father-state hail     escaped from     its temporary subjection to the first
Bonapartist      empire of France, and had joined the Helvetic Con
federacy — Eniile Plantamour's         commencing epoch was that of young
Switzerland, and       he ultimately    became as excellent a representative
as could be found anywhere of that peculiar yet admirable microcosm
of a republic,      whose   strict observance of       law and order the red
agitators of Paris can by no             means    understand   ;  and even    the
United States of North America, republicans and democrats alike,
do not altogether        comprehend       how it    can continue      to exist so
                            "
anomalously to them — a republic without              a  president !
                                                                     "
                                                                         And yet
it  not only exists, but lasts and grows, produces wealthy families
too, capable, as with the Plantamours, of educating themselves up
to the highest pitch of usefulness to their State, without seeking
any help from others beyond the use of the self-supporting institu
tions in that    case already made and provided.
    But just    as the school, or    "the old college," wherein the young
 Plantamour spent the earliest of his hard-working years of learning
 as a boy, was of that staid and solid character that might be
 expected     in an institution founded           by Calvin, soon after the
 Reformation,     so the comfortable      private means of the older Planta
 mour's,   like that of    so   many other Genevan          families,   had been
 attained in    a manner    worthily corresponding thereto.           For not by
 manufactures     nor by commerce,       still less  by speculations or bubble
 companies,     were those tidy little Alpine accumulations             obtained,
 but by the magnificent moral control of the progenitors of the family
 and their successors, one and all determining to live, though put to
 any straits for a time, on half only of their yearly income, leaving
 the other half to grow at compound interest.
    Emile Plantamour himself was still too young to think much of
 these   things while at Calvin's school; but by the time                 he had
 passed through that institution, also through the higher academy of
 Hofroyl, and then the        classes   of the Genevan University, he was
 called on to choose      his future walk in life as a working member
 of the busy republican mountain hive.                So he elected to be an
 astronomer    — a Helvetian astronomer of course.            But what is there
 peculiar    in that prefix?      This mainly,      that while the Helvetian
  confederation    forms so small     a   patch of    country,   surrounded    by

                                        8
great empires,      it yet possesses   more diversity of populations       than
any of them ; so that but for the mysterious cord of Helvetic unity,
its French cantons would he ever fighting against the German, and
the Italian against both.        Wherefore, all the great and good citizens
of that up and down mountainous            land seem ever to have a most
difficult problem of their own to work at, viz., how to keep up the
vigour and elasticity, the frictional polish and emulating fervour of
those several competing nationalities,         while inducing them, never
theless, to do all peacefully, and voluntarily to contribute each their
best characteristics, so as to raise the united name of a Swiss
republican      for virtue and education, valour, prudence, and under
standing, above that of all collections of men,          if possible, ruled    in
any other manner.         Wherefore, thus did M. Plantamour proceed on
attaining to virile growth and privileges.
     From the university       of his native city he went to Paris, and
studied     for two years under Arago, that grand specimen of the
Celtic Gaul ; a man of superb genius, of commanding presence, of
daring flights into the connection        and bearings of hitherto      untrod
branches of physical science ; and with whom occasional researches
into the curiosities of magnetism, or the uncultivated              jungles    of
meteorology, combined with public displays)        >f fervid eloquence — took
the place of regular observatory work, and was thought everything
 of, almost up to adoration, in the midst of a Latino-Celtic popu
lation.
     After highly approving himself and his mountain-born              abilities
among that class of men, descendants of warriors             and native chiefs
of long, long ago, — Emile Plantamour went north to Konigsberg,
and there, under the grandest soul in all Germany for philosophical
breadth, instrumental       skill, and mathematical power in gravitational
 astronomy — though originally only a grocer's          apprentice, the illus
 trious Bessel — he learned by what kind of steady work and calm
 devotion     in  a quiet  home the Teutonic      mind obtains     some  of its
 highest    triumphs.      While thus truly     a student     studying   under
 Bessel, young Plantamour          produced, as a thesis, a most creditable
         •'
 essay      On the Determination      of the Orbit of a Comet according to
 Olbers'    Method     from   three Observations."      Next    he went into
 Berlin, where, under the celebrated Encke, ho learned the still more
 rigid work of meridian astronomy, besides enjoying the improving

                                        9
society    of   the  great traveller  Humboldt, the magnetical            mathe
matician Gauss, and the astronomical analyst Hansen.
    Keturning to Geneva in 1839, the venerable Alfred Gautier retired,
and Plantamour,        able now to look on astronomy from every side,
or  as a Switzer of each and every diversely tongued canton, was
installed as director of the observatory, with powers to choose and
direct accordingly.        Wherefore   thus he proceeded.          Not with any
of the two or three great observatories of the three or four gigantic
countries, powerful governments, and populous nations around him,
would     he   contend    in their ancient and still prescriptive work of
procuring new expressions for the oldest fundamentals of the grand
classic astronomy of sun, moon, and principal planets            ;  no fresh and
always minutely differing values would he attempt for the exact
 quantities of precession and nutation, for the aberration of light, for
refraction,     and   sun-distance;   on each of which          inquiries   such
myriads     of pounds sterling have been, and still are, being spent,
 and libraries of books written in the great centres of civilisation ;
 but, while fully appreciating       both   the grandeur      and difficulty of
 those problems as much as any of the savants working at them, he
 chose more especially " the orbits of Comets as the future distinc
                                                      "
 tive subject of his observatory labours.
    Comets,      however,    will not always     come   just when       they are
 wanted ; and so, for a time, we find the disciple             of the German
 Bessel, remembering anew the Gallic Arago, and to such purpose,
 that the very earliest of his published       memoirs in his new director
 ship, was on
                    " Atmospheric    Electricity."    Then    came    two years
 observations of terrestrial      magnetism.    And next, duly considering
 the wants of those of his countrymen engaged in the staple industry
 of Geneva, watch-making, he organised          a department       in the obser
 vatory where watches and chronometers sent in by the local makers
 are submitted to a variety of scientific tests, the results published,
 and prizes awarded         for the best time-keepers     ;  with the happiest
 effects too  in promoting improvements in that most delicate branch
of all the mechanical      arts.
    But in 1843, Plantamour's         own faithful waiting was at length
 rewarded     by the apparition of     one   of the most splendid, and in
 every way remarkable, comets of modern times.              Seen first in broad
 daylight    close   to the sun, and afterwards      hurrying away into the

                                                  1(1
 depths of space with              a   longer train than any known comet since
 Newton's day, this chief of comets, in 1843, opened                      a new epoch       of
 activity    among all the observatories                ;  while Plantamour         was   the
 first of the computers         to announce that in its perihelian passage               this
 comet must have almost                 grazed the very surface of the sun.             That
 it must    have seen for two hours the sun's                   incandescent disc under
an angle of practically 180", and have been exposed for that length
of time to     a  radiation sufficient to vapourise iron, platinum, and every
known metal         ;  yet had it lived, preserved              its movement,     and gone
off at last apparently uninfluenced on its regular orbit.                        And what
kind of orbit       was that     1
    Ah  !   That      indeed is the question            ;  never more abundantly dis
cussed     too than at this moment                in connection with      a comet    of the
present     year.       Plantamour          had been strong enough           in his     first
theoretical university essay on the beauty of determining a comet's
orbit from three observations                ;  but ho soon learned in practice that
no three observations ever taken by man, much less the first three
that are usually secured of such a sudden and unexpected                           intruder
as the great comet          of 1843, can give more than             a very wide approxi
mation to that one of all the orbital elements which the public most
cares for, viz., its period          ;   and thence     the date when     it will next     be
seen, as well       as that when           it  was last visible.      He showed      indeed
without controversy, that it was                 a closed   orbit, and of no very great
duration; but whether                  of 165 years,        or 22, or even       less — and
why, in that case it had not been seen oftener, subsequent to its
supposed      record     in 18G8, he left for the future to determine.
    And now        comets     followed one another quickly              ; the next with
which     Plantamour         occupied himself             being the second        of  1844,
called    the    Comet of Mauvais              ; and a most opposite one it was to
that of 1813 in almost every particular.                      Por this of 1844, though
little  more      at any time            than    barely visible     to  the   naked     eye,
remained within telescopic                range    for nearly nine months       ; was   well
and numerously observed                  during the whole of the time, and gave
to M. Plantamour's            calculations, perfected          as they were    in this in
stance by his careful introduction of corrections for planetary pertur
bations,    a  perihelion distance of so much as 78 millions of miles;
and a period, reaching the hitherto                   unheard of extent, of 102,000
years, subject to an uncertainty               of not   more than g'jjth of the whole.

                                              11
     Again in 184G came the separation of Biela's comet into two.
These were long followed up by Plantamour, both by observation
aud     calculation   ;  until he at length proved them to                  be each pro
ceeding     on its    own independent           course   through space, quite           un
influenced      by the other.        It  was but a small telescopic        comet at any
time, until that startling telegraphic announcement of Herr Klin-
kerfues to Mr. Pogson at the Madras Observatory, on December 2
(1872),     thus    concentrating        the results of his long and difficult
orbital calculations : — " Biela touched earth on November                      27, search
near 6 centauri."          Pogson     accordingly turned his telescope              in that
southern      direction,    and found a retreating,        and already far-off patch
of cometary       matter    in that     quarter.    But what had the inhabitants
of the northern        side of    the earth witnessed on the 27th of Novem
ber!      A brilliant       display     of shooting stars so-called,          or   isolated
 meteoric stones, darting through the upper rarefied air at the rate of
 more than       1000 miles a minute, and taking the regular meteoric
 observers      quite   by surprise,      as being an altogether abnormal and
 unexpected       vision to them.
     Here, accordingly, was admirable authority for Plantamour adding
 to the Besselian        astronomy of cometary          orbits, the physical studios
  of the Aragonian        school.     But his observatory       was   ill  supplied with
  instruments of size and quality                adapted    to  such researches,        and
  neither the      University of Geneva, nor the politicians thereof,                  wore
  inclined to spend anything              to improve      them.     So, by noble solf-
   denial,   and    out of the economies            of his ancestors,         Plantamour
   supplied    a fine equatorial,     with objective of      10 inches aperture,       with
   tower    and    revolving      dome,     to the establishment         ;  and kept       it
   thenceforward at excellent work for the credit of the community
   and the promotion of astronomy.
       The situation, too, was deserving of being so powerfully                      instru-
   mentalised.       No   less than 10 degrees of latitude further soutli than
   Edinburgh, raised on a plateau              1200   feet above     the sea-level,     in a
    drier and generally warmer air, and              with far    less of dreadful coal
    smoke    belching around from blackened and blackening chimneys                          ;
    a telescope     could    there be used         to its full advantage         ; and the.
    climate itself    would afford,      especially in the land, and         to a country
    man,   of  Saussuie, a most deeply interesting study.
       From his very first appointment to the observatory, Plantamour

                                           12
  had continued in the Bibliotheque           Universelle Journal, the publica
  tion of the comparative        meteorological      observations       begun to be
  taken long before, both at Geneva and at the Hospice                     on Mount
  St. Bernard    ;  the earliest example it is said of a systematic study          of
 the climate of elevated regions         ;  and the results, discussed as they
 were by the hand of a master, were                eventually     published    in his
 work entitled       The  Climate    of   Geneva   from 50 years of Observa
 tion.    To  these   again he added his brilliant studies of the physical
 geography of the region, chiefly from the astronomical and accurate
 point of view      ; conducting    extensive levellings,       both instrumental
 and barometric, over the highest ridges, and through                    the deepest
 valleys of Europe; determining also the force of gravity by pendulum
 observations      in numerous localities, and their longitudes both by
 telegraphic signals and geodesic        measures    of the most exact kind.
     In  short, this admirable       man, as our        own    learned     and  most
 devoted librarian, Mr. James Gordon — to whom I owe much of
 these materials, has kindly informed me — produced in his time no
       than 83 distinct memoirs, varying in size from                             to

 besides several other memoirs in conjunction              with M. Hirsch and
 M. Birner, chiefly geodetic.
     No wonder then that his local biographers have described, that
even in his later years, when though over-shadowed by the threaten-
ings of his eventually fatal disease, he yet worked a full eight hours
a day ; and at a      kind of astronomical labour which           does not exactly
repose the mind.         Yet through it all, they record that           he was ever
the gentleman, the man useful to the community,                 and always ready
to give his services wherever they were asked.                   Ob   !  what abne
gation of self, for who amongst us, living happily under an ancient,
long consolidated,       and much      loved     constitutional    monarchy, can

                                         13
presume     to know the many          republican    calls that     were made on
Citizen Plantamour's time and attention.
    " All  the scions of our richer families," said          a fine old specimen
of a New York State          country gentleman to me not long ago,
                                                                               " find
it expedient to enter       into politics, in order to understand the mind
of the people, and endeavour to lead public opinion."                    So too did
Plantamour,        and   with   success.     For    he was      listened     to with
deference     whenever     he spoke, even in the most radical assemblies.
And if not personally present, the            mere    statement by any orator
there that " Plantamour           thinks so," would often          suffice   to carry
 the day.
    And in Emile Plantamour there            was something more and beyond
 mere political wisdom to admire.          For when      I had,   on one occasion,
 the honour of receiving         a letter from    him   ; and which, beginning
 with   a discussion    of the Meteorology of the xiiith voL of the Edin
 burgh    Astronomical      Observations, went on to speak of various little
 local institutions he was interested in,            as   his Bible Society, his
 Scripture reading Society among the poor, and other similar insti
 tutions,   a   lady listening     to my reading started to her feet and
 demanded " What French savant             was capable of such ideas."
     So   then    I  had   to explain,    that   although     the letter might be
  written in the French language, the man himself was                     a Switzer ;
  born in Geneva      ; and educated in     a  school founded by Calvin, and
  approved of by      John Knox.       Whence     immediately       she understood
  the possibility,   or even recognised the origin, of that wide philan-
  throphy joined to the highest            science.     And this meeting          will
  doubtless    similarly appreciate how much our Society has lost in
  every way by Emile Plantamour's recent demise ; so very soon too,
  or within 18 months, after the Council had selected his name to
  occupy that honoured place amongst our Foreign                  Associates which
  the Royal Society of Edinburgh has always desired to see filled by
  some representative of that noble, though circumscribed,                community
  dwelling amongst the higher Alps.

     Late and for long the Surveyor-General of our vast colony                  of the
 Cape of Good Hope, elected an Ordinary                  Fellow of this Society on
 March    i,  1878.      Died here on the 7th of         April  1882, aged 69.
     Born at Newhall,         in the parish of Crail, in the East            Xeuk of
 Fife, in   1813,   in  a  family of three, and of         so long lived a race that
 his mother lived to 85, his father attained to 90, his father's older
 brother, General Sir John Bell,           a  leading officer of the Staff Corps
 in the Peninsular         War, and highly approved of by               the  Duke of
 Wellington,     reached the still nobler age of 95, and                 a grand-aunt
 lived to be 101, -while his own brother and sister are still living,
 hale and hearty      ;
                        — it might therefore         have  been  hoped, that when
 Charles D. Bell retired from southern official life to this country,               in
 1874, there were yet many years              before him, wherein to exercise       at
leisure the many fine talents wherewith                   he was gifted, and     in   a
 manner     to show      forth    something       of the fervid      love and even
ecstatic devotion he always bore to his native land, notwithstanding
his long separation       from it.
    But that    was not to be.         The trials and the stresses he had gone
through in the South African climate and country were too many
and too severe, however successfully they seemed to be overcome                     at
the time.      Success, indeed, usually crowned almost everything                  he
undertook ; and he would have had a far more notable name among
us had his career been          confined to Old Scotland, instead of being
spent so entirely ;is      it was from his sixteenth          to his sixty-first year
in that new and        greater Scotland which stretches          now all across the
globe, from Canada in the north-west to Australia                and New Zealand
in   the   south-east,     with    the   Cape     as   a very central     stronghold.
Originally, no doubt, the Cape was              a Dutch colony, but      one wherein
it  was long ago        remarked       to  me, that among the          many British
residents that had come             flocking    in, every one who got on best,
whether in the higher or lower walks of life, was always a Scotch
man.     And   one of the most noteworthy of those, because                mainly by
such original efforts and innate qualities of his own, was the subject
of this notice.
    Though leaving his country at            so   early an age (in 1829), Charles

                                              15
D. Bell's preparations          and prospects were good      ;  for he had attended
classes at St. Andrews           University, in fellow-studentship with John
Goodsir (afterwards           Professor of Anatomy in Edinburgh) and his
brother Joseph, the           minister.      While at the    Cape, his uncle, then
Colonel Bell, private           secretary to the Governor, and afterwards and
for many years the sage            and    steady Colonial   Secretary, was greatly
interested        in him.
      After a period of service in the Secretary's office, C. D. Bell was
transferred to that          of the Master of the Supreme Court, and then to
the       Audit Office of the Colonial Government, becoming a favourite
 everywhere ; until it seemed as if his friends intended the young
 man for a future          of nothing but quiet, resident, jog-trot official life
 in Cape        Town itself, and no further.         But in 1833, Sir (then plain
 Dr.) Andrew            Smith (of the Army Medical Service) succeeded in
 organising an         exploring expedition for penetrating into the interior
 of South        Africa on a grander scale than anything hitherto attempted.
  "Whereupon the internal fires of C. D. Bell's own spirit broke forth                 ;
  and,     against the advice and even strenuous opposition of his legal
  guardians (for he was            still under    age), he would     give   up all his
  other prospects         in order  to seize this opportunity    of penetrating into
   the great      unknown.       And though      he was allowed to     join  the party
   at the last      moment, it was only on condition of taking the lowest
   place     in  it
         An old friend, who well remembered             meeting   him just after he
    received      his leave, has some years since described in print the wild
    enthusiasm        with which C. D. Bell galloped through the             streets  of
    Cape     Town to dash off preparations for the immediate start                   He
    vras a    handsome-looking young fellow too ; not very tall, but broad-
     built and muscular,        with   a rather brown     complexion, but regular
     ie&tures of     refined and sculpturesque character,       piercing black eyes,
    and dark       lank hair.
         The expedition, in spite of its numbers, was generally looked on
     as   one   of imminent danger.          The latest previous expedition had
     k>en    cut off to a man       ; and no previous parties     had ever returned
     without having undergone more or less perils of thirst, of hunger,
     of   wild beasts,    of lurking Bushmen with poisoned arrows, and whole
      tribes  of more     openly slaughtering foes.       But away went this new
      expedition,     striking straight  across those 6tony tablelands of      blinding

                                         16'^
sunshine, roasting heat, and terrestrial         drought, which fence in the
 Cape Colony along its northern and north-western frontiers almost as
imperviously     to all ordinary travellers as though they were walls of
iron rising up to skies of       brass,   and intended to prevent inquirers
from entering into the mysterious interior beyond, stretching away,
as it was then supposed, uninterruptedly to the Equator itself.
   A Kaffir    war breaking      out    soon afterwards     on the north-east
frontier of the colony, the expedition was lost for a time to sight
and hearing ; but after three years it returned safe, successfully too,
on the whole, and with C. D. Bell raised by shere merit and proved
capacity to be its second in command.            But  he had done far more
than merely rule over others, and order their services             ;  for when
the Association     which had defrayed the expenses of the expedition
held a public meeting in 1836 to exhibit its results (a meeting at
which Sir John Herschel, then in the colony on astronomical
research, presided, and gave         a splendid     address), every one was
astonished, delighted,      and instructed      at finding the walls of the
room decorated by nearly three hundred of C. D. Bell's drawings.
He had      been   the artist of the expedition, and such an artist as
showed him to possess a soul of true genius,           if there be any one    in
the world of whom that can be properly said.
   There, in those matchless drawings, was the peculiar country the
expedition    had passed     through,     in its minuter    as well    as larger
features  ;  unadulterated,    moreover, artistically     by any methods      of
drawing taught at home on English              trees  and hedges     and shady
lanes ; for C. D. Bell had taught himself in South Africa on exactly
what nature presented to him there.           Hence was the great interior's
physical geography, geology, and vegetation, too, where there was any,
depicted again     and again, either in brilliant colour, or chiaro-teuro
force of black and white, and almost perfect truth of outline ;            with
the very atmosphere also before one to look into, as it shimmered
and boiled in the vividness       of solar light, and over stony surfaces
heated up to 140° or 150° Fahr.         ;  but yet garnished with episodes
of the wild animals of the region — generally gigantic mammals, of
South Africa to-day, but of other parts of the earth only in some
past geological age    ; and with lifelike examples of the natives            of
every tribe whose lands the expedition had traversed, depicted in
their most characteristic avocations.         From little Bushmen securing

                                           17
once in     a way a mountain          of meat,    in  a desert    without water, by
taking     a two-horned    rhinoceros     in   a   pit-fall, to the Zulu regiments
of King      Moselikatse going forth with cow-hide shield and stabbing
assegai to exterminate        some neighbouring          tribe ; or the poor of his
kingdom,       with famine girdles braced tightly round their loins,
following in the track of lions, in hopes of partaking of some of
their leavings : they were all on those faithful sheets of paper.
While, so keen was C. D. Bell's appreciation of the ridiculous, that
if there     was any young fop among the nearly naked Bechuana or
 Malokolo, who wore his dress of            a  few jackals' tails and same glass
beads with      a particular   twist of his own invention, and thought he
looked     so handsome    in it that all the women must            be   falling in love
with him, this native-born dandy            was sure to figure        in  some    one or
other of Mr. Bell's drawiugs ; for he drew as much, or more, from
memory in the silent watches of the night, as by sketching direct
 from nature through the day.
     That that brilliant collection of          pieces    of graphical      information
 never saw the light again until, after twenty                 years,  a few of them
 straggled    out to illustrate    later travellers' books, — was no fault of
 Mr. Bell's.      For he had necessarily         to give them up to           his chief ;
 and he,    a very learned naturalist,      and taken up far more with curio
 sities   in the way      of    undescribed      snakes, — was allowed            by the
 Association to carry out        a scheme     of his own for obtaining renewed
funds for more expeditions,             by exhibiting all his natural history
 treasures in that focus of wealth           and Government           patronage, Lon
 don   ; but with  a result  which totally failed to pay its own expenses.
     Meanwhile Mr. Bell quietly re-entered the Audit Office of the
 Colonial Government,         where he was raised from his former junior
 position to be chief clerk         ;  and not long         after that received the
 acting clerkship to the Legislative Council, holding that honourable
position during     a two years' absence of the proper officer.
     But   mere pen-work     within four walls was not enough to satisfy
 C. D. Bell's aspirations, or assure his conscience that he was thereby
 turning to the utmost account all the varied talents committed to
 him by his Creator.           In   1838, therefore,         he began to turn his
 attention to surveying, and became soon after, one of the sworn land
 surveyors of the colony; — a colony twice the size of Great Britain,
 but with a population       of half the city of Edinburgh.                A   colony of
                                                                                b

                                              18
immense,                mountain ranges (Le Vaillant termed ono
              craggy, rocky,
of them " the backbone of the earth                       "),
                                      and extensive desert plains,
with   a   nice variation in the quality of their barrenness                          accordingly
as   they were of deep sand or ferruginous clay, mixed or unmixed
with salt and      gypsum.         A    colony, too, where the British element of
population was still in utmost minority                         ;   and where the surveying
system      hitherto    in      vogue    in   the back, or over-berg,             country     had
been — to let any Dutch boor, wanting land, choose                              some possible
central water-hole in Government or unoccupied                                   ground,      and
then ride round        it   on horseback for three                  hours, or drive round        it
on an ox- waggon            for three days, according to its degree of want
of    vegetation  ;     such interested boer undertaking                         to    remember
against all future          comers      what particular             isolated bushes, or great
rocks in the weary land, he had seen during such circumferential
ride or drive, and had then and there chosen                            to be his baakens, or
landmarks for ever afterwards.
     As population      increased,       such   a   system was of course most             fruitful
in land disputes, and            the then Surveyor-General,                  Colonel Mitchell,
formerly of the Portuguese Legion in the Peninsular War, found his
attempts to introduce accurate                  surveying into town lots grievously
swamped        by having presently the legal business of certain Land-
drosts,      Heem-raden, and up-country                     Dutch Civil Commissioners,
further thrust upon him, and his then sole assistant, Mr. Hertzog.                             He
applied, therefore,         in 1840, and obtained Mr. Bell's appointment as
Second Assistant             Surveyor-General         when ho (C. D. Bell) was
                                                      ;
immediately sent off on            a    long and solitary travel, occupying several
months (quite      a   geographical exploration in itself, in his little ox
cart, and attended          only by     a   Malay driver and            a   Hottentot leader of
the oxen), to the north-western corner of the colony, to settle                               dis
puted claims there          ;   some of them on the cool Khamiesberg granite
mountains       5000 and 6000 feet high, others in the hot and arid
plains below, or the sandstone ranges and steppe formations further
eastward      and northward, even             as    far    as    to the Orange        River below
its falls.     And     he settled them so satisfactorily,                    and with so much
calmness      and wisdom, that the Dutch                        boers   ever after that always
addressed      him, though still only twenty-seven years of age, by their
title of highest honour, viz.,              " Old Mynheer Bell."
     He was next appointed to organise                     a     survey office in the eastern

                                     10
district of the colony, where so many Scotch settlers were established
under Pringle and others many years before, in what the Dutch
had stigmatised as the " Zuureveld," or field where the                grass  was
sour, and in their eyes, and to their means         and resources,      good for
nothing, except to stick Englishmen in, to serve           as buffer between
 them and the Kaffirs.     From thence he     was taken     for   a time   by the
new Governor of the colony, Sir Peregrine Maitland, to inspect the
 Kaffir frontier and interior districts. And again, in 1845, across the
upper Orange River       to Zwartkopjies,    " where,"    says a local      print,
 "the information     he had acquired in the expedition            of 1833 was
found extremely useful."       No doubt it    was, too, and yet not suffi
ciently utilised    by the Government       at home;       for had it been,
several calamitous disasters of recent years, and excitations, of inter
national hatred in the north-east of that country, would have been
avoided.     The distribution, too, of the British settlers would have
been arranged in    a  manner to profit far more by the physical             geo
graphy of South Africa     ;  which offers a Brazilian climate on one side
against an Arabia Deserta on the other,        if  you only go far enough
 in either direction from the intermediate point of Table Mountain
and Table Bay, where the Dutch first landed, and for             so long looked
upon it   as  their only and commanding        centre for their agriculture,
 commerce, and government in all the southern hemisphere.
    In  1848 Mr. Bell became, on the demise of Colonel              Mitchell    (a
demise much lamented, and hastened in no small degree by the extra
 anxieties of his office), full Surveyor-General      of the Cape of Good
Hope.      Thenceforward,     for twenty-six years, he ruled             in that
department with a suavity, firmness, and knowledge                that obtained
the best possible results for Government,       out of an otherwise almost
hopeless, tangled collection of conflicting       interests, old legislations,
and changed ideas.      His thorough knowledge of the colony in which
he had grown       up to man's estate,    his mature development of a
judicial   breadth   of view,   combined with his scientific skill and
mechanical abilities, were evidently     becoming more and more appre
ciated ; for, spite of the over-work       of his own       office,   he was so
frequently requested to join divers        Government        committees, and
 prepare special reports, such as that on the establishment for con
victs, lepers, and lunatics on Eobben Island, the newly-found copper
fields of Little Namaqua land : and various lines of road to open up

                                          20
hitherto untrodden districts         : until at last, such extra demands of
the upper colonial      officials culminated      in this, —that whereas they
had quarrelled with and dismissed their recently imported                    English
engineer-in-chief      for   a proposed      line   of   Metropolitan Railway,
extending      from Cape Town to the Berg River Valley, and some
one must be found to take his place, they unanimously                    agreed   that
C. D. Rell was       that man ; because         he was the      only one amongst
 them who could lay out railway curves, build bridges, raise em
 bankments, bore tunnels, inspect locomotives, and, in a word, save
 them, the great       officials of the new     " responsible    Government,"        so
 called, in the eyes of the people, and before public opinion.
     And he did help them through that great difficulty by extra
 ordinary    exertions    of his own, and which he could hardly have
 accomplished at his then advanced age, but that he had never spared
 himself.     He had lived      a triple life all along   ; first, his official life,
 whoso duties were always paramount with him ; second, his private
 social life, where he was always a favourite          ;  and lastly, his artistic
 life, which occupied almost every other moment of his existence.
     In  1846, while still in Cape Town, by shere dint of his know
 ledge of the eastern country          and people, he produced         a  long series
 of drawings in black and white, representing events in the Kaffir
  war then raging under Sir Peregrine Maitland, —drawings which
 astonished and delighted the soldiers who had been engaged                     in the
  operations, — and, being sent home, were taken on one occasion by
  tho Duke of Wellington into his private study, to con over alone,
  before giving his opinion on the conduct of that war to the House
  of Lords.
      In  1847,   having    come    homo on a short leave of absence,               Mr.
  Bell procured from Messrs. Schenck              & Co. of this city,         a  litho
  graphic press and stones, learned to work it himself,                 threw off at
  once a number of South African subjects, varying                  from the      R*V.
  Mr. Moffat      preaching     to  Beehuanas,      down     to  Amakosa       Kaffirs
  torturing   a wounded      prisoner   ; and took the wholo plant out with
  him to Cape Town, a novel and important              accession    at that time to
  its means of graphic multiplication.
      There   he  further    worked     at oil painting    ;  and when tho com
  munity    at last began to awake to the importance            of art culture, and
  opened an exhibition of pictures, ho carried off their gold medal for

                                             21
    a  spirited historical    painting,    representing    Van Riebock founding
    the Cape Colony in 1650.
       Wood carving next came in for attention during some of C. D.
    Bell's spare hours ; also modelling in clay ; such models, after
    baking in an oven, being then painted in natural colours. For the
   object of most of these artistic works " in the round
                                                                     " was to
                                                                               pre
   serve the physiognomy,         manners, customs, tastes, and traditions       of
   the native   races   of South Africa.     He had enjoyed the opportunity of
   seeing those races      on his first arrival in their country, still numerous,
   distinctive, and true in their stationary savagedom to              a long past
  antiquity ; but before he left, they were rapidly losing, under new
  conditions, those characteristic          features, as well as their ancient,
  imperfect mother tongues.
       Such then was the man, Charles D. Bell, who, leaving most of
  those precious works behind him, or having given them away right
  and left too generously as soon as completed, returned to this country
  in 1874, with his second wife (a Cape lady), two sons, and a
  daughter.       Giving vent immediately to his long pent-up passionate
  admiration for his native land, he soon joined the Antiquaries and
  the Meteorological Societies, as well as our own ; wrote on the
 ancient harps of Scotland, and began             to illustrate in painting  some
  of the touching ballads of the country's former                 days.    But his
 existence was saddened by the quickly following deaths of mother,
 father, and uncle.          Then he suddenly          lost the use of one eye.
 Without external change, or internal feel, the sight power was gone.
 He had always been very short of sight, however keen ; and it was
 that    eye, whose surrounding       muscular contractions had enabled him
 to keep     a strong concave     lens always in place through fifty yeare of
excellent work, which had now suddenly broken down.
      But most of all was he      affected   by the sudden and totally unex
pected demise at Crail, during           a summer residence there last year,
in his father's old house, of his beloved Wife.                His faithful spirit
never recovered that blow, and he but lingered on for some six
months further, until he followed her himself.
      I cannot   expect that, with my imperfect knowledge of his most
multifarious      life,  I have in any   way succeeded      in representing it as
 it  so  fully deserves to be represented, in all its noble character and
just proportions.          Nor is there, perhaps, the most pressing of all

                                      22
 necessities that   I should  do so before the present audience   ; for it ia
 not we, but the Cape people who should erect a statue to him            :   to
 him, Charles D. Bell, who did, and accomplished,          and suffered so
 much for them and amongst them, through           all the best years of
 his long period of      a most   hard-working life and publicly useful
 career.                                                        C. P.   &
       William Robertson, M.D.             By George Seton, Esq.,
                                  Advocate.
    Dr. William Robertson was born in Edinburgh on the 8th of
January     1818.    He was the eldest son of Mr. George Robertson,
Keeper of the Records in H.M. General Register House, by Eliza
Brown, his wife, sister       to General  Sir George Brown, of Crimean
fame,    and Mr. Peter Brown, well known as an agriculturist and
land    valuator   in the north of Scotland.      He obtained     his early
education at the Edinburgh Academy, from which ho passed to the
 University j and, after completing the medical curriculum, he con
tinued    his   studies   at Paris, Berlin, and Vienna.       In  1839      he
graduated     M.D. of Edinburgh, his Thesis being on Enlargement of
the Heart, which proved to be the diseaso from which he suffered
prior to his death.         Four years afterwards he was admitted a
Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.        He acted for some timo
as   a physician     in the Royal Infirmary, the Fever and Cholera
Hospitals,    and    the   New Town Dispensary;         and,  holding      the
appointment      of Inspector-Physician of the British Civil Hospital
at Renkioi,    in virtue of the recommendation of Sir Robert Chris-
tison, ho served as a physician during the Crimean war.          He was at
one time editor of the    Edinburgh Monthly Journal of Medical Science,
to which he contributed several papers.        On the resignation of Dr.
Stark, in 1874, he was appointed to the post of Superintendent              of
the Statistical Department in the General       Registry Office of Births,
Deaths, and Marriages, having previously acted as Medical Registrar
for Scotland.      One of his latest official works was the preparation
of the Report      prefixed to the first volume relative   to the Scottish
Census of 1881.        In  1876, on the death of Dr. Warburton Begbie,
ho became medical officer to the Scottish Widows' Fund, having by
that timo gained large experience        in matters connected with Life

                                        •2i\
Insurance, in the capacity of medical           referee   to the Guardian    and
Scottish Equitable Societies.
    Distinguished by his diagnostic skill and his thorough knowledge
of therapeutics, but for his modest and retiring disposition                  Dr.
Robertson     might, in the opinion of competent judges, have taken a
very distinguished place      as a consulting    physician   ;  and, owing to his
high reputation as a mathematician and a statist, he was eminently
fitted for the two appointments which he held at the time of his
death.     His capacity for figures was of     a very   high order.   He did not
hesitate, however, to facilitate      his elaborate calculations by the       use
of the arithmometer, which he was able to turn to the best account,
owing to his remarkable memory and his                    powers of numerical
combination.
    Not were his acquirements confined to physical and mathematical
science.     While well versed in classical as well as modern literature,
he was an excellent linguist, being familiar with French, German,
Italian, and Turkish, and possessing         a fair acquaintance with Spanish
 and Dutch.
    In  social life he was a universal favourite, in consequence of his
kindly and genial disposition, his fund of              anecdote,   and his well-
 stored   mind.      One   of the original members of the Edinburgh
 Evening Club,      he seldom failed to appear at       its bi-weekly meetings,
 where    the blank      which his lamented death has            caused  will not
 easily  be supplied.     His cordial sympathy with the young was an
 interesting   feature in his character.          He was     a devoted   member
 of the Church of Scotland, and his political tendencies were Con
 servative.
    In   connection    with his official appointment           in the Registrar-
 General's Department,       it may be mentioned that the office of Joint
 Deputy Keepers of the Records was held, in the first instance, by
 Dr. Robertson's grandfather and granduncle, in succession to whom
 it was held, also jointly, by his father and uncle, and singly, at a
 later period, by his brother George Brown Robertson, Writer to the
 Signet, who died in 1873.          Accordingly, the official connection of
 the family with the General Register House extended over a period
 of upwards of     a hundred years.
    Dr. Robertson      became    a  Fellow of the Royal Society in 1860.
    His death occurred at his residence in Albany Street on the 25th of

                                    24
August 1882, at the comparatively early age of sixty -four. He Lad
been in failing health for about two years, but it was only a week
before he died that he became seriously ill.          His funeral took place
in Warriston Cemetery on the 29th of August, and was attended by
a large concourse of attached relatives and friends.
   Dr. Kobertson is survived by two        sisters,   with   one  of whom he
resided, while the other is the wife of Mr.          John Gillespie, Writer
to the Signet,     and Secretary to the Eoyal Company              of Archers.
His youngest brother, Alexander,       a promising       artillery officer, was
one of the many victims of the Indian        Mutiny of     1857.
   Since the above was prepared, the writer has received a letter
from one of Dr. Robertson's medical compeers (Dr. George Bell) in
reply to an application on the subject of bis chess-playing, in which
ho says   : — " Dr. Kobertson      was  no    ordinary     chess-player ;    he
understood the game, and practised       it with judgment and skill.          I
know this, for    the ' chequered field' was our favourite meeting-place
during many     years.   Always pleasant there      as elsewhere,   Edinburgh
does   not know what a rare son she has lost.             Though undemon
strative,   the Royal    Society  had few such        members as       William
Robertson."
  Sir Daniel Macnee.            By the Rev. Walter C. Smith, D.D.
   Daniel Macnee's life, like that of most hard workers, was not a
very eventful one.       Its chief incidents were its productions, and
these   were nowise startling,    but rather such as might have been
looked for — fruits of patient labour, and proofs of quiet growth.
Born at Fintry in 1806, he lost his father while yet a mere child ;
but he was happy in having a mother who could understand and
guide liis youth.     Very likely that youth puzzled her a little at first,
for she would fain have trained him for merchandise and money-
making, and his gifts did not lie at all in that line.              The sleepy
valloy of the Endrick, among the green Campsie hills, had to pro
duce its genius like other Scottish glens ; and probably his mother
had her anxiety, as well as her pride, when it began to dawn upon
her that she had given birth to one of that wayward race.            I suppose

                                         25
he did his school tasks fairly well for her            sake ;  hut after school
hours,   if  he was not fishing      the water, he was sketching        his com
panions, or telling the drollest stories of things he had seen or heard,
which were truly pictures of the vividest kind.               So she concluded
that he was bom to        be an artist ; and that, no doubt, was his own
opinion     also.   Yet, with all his well-merited          success,  it may  be
doubted whether        they were not both of them mistaken.              That he
had genius was clear enough, and that he was fond of drawing
pictures was plain to every one who knew him.                  But whether his
genius would best find its true field in painting the outward or the
inward man — faces or characters — that the gossips of Fintry could
hardly be expected to determine. It showed some courage then, at that
early stage of Scottish art, to devote a boy of thirteen to so precari
ous a means of living       ; but   it would, no doubt, have looked like
very madness to bring him up for the               career  of a man of letters.
 Yet, excellent    as his portraits   are — and some    of them caught not the
features only,      but the very spirit of the sitter — those who knew
him, and can remember the delicate shades and dramatic play of
character in the stories with which he was wont to brighten our
 social intercourse,    will hardly doubt that his real power lay rather
 in word-painting     than in material pigments.          The patient industry
 which he devoted to art would have           made   him a subtle dramatist —
 a  writer of such comedies      as Scotland     has never yet produced, or a
 novelist to rival her very best.         I am not  sure, then, that in making
 an excellent painter of him, we did not lose something greater still,
 for which nature had specially endowed him.
     There was a Glasgow artist, at this time, who bore the honourable
 name of    John Knox, to which, however, he has not added any fresh
 lustre, for he will probably be known hereafter chiefly as the
 teacher of Daniel Macnee and Horatio Macculloch                        Yet there
  must have been something in him to have trained two such men.
  These two formed their life-long friendship in Knox's studio ; and
  many a trip, doubtless, the two lads had together to the lochs of
  Argyle and Dumbarton,        and many a Highland story they picked up,
  and learned to interpret well tho character both of its scenery and
  its people.     Afterwards Macnee         came  to Edinburgh, and studied
  at the Academy there, along with Thomas Duncan,                  Scott Lauder,
  and David Scott, who all became his warm friends.                 For there was

                                        2G
 no mean jealousy in Lis nature, but he gladly recognised the genius
 of his compeers, even when their views of art differed wholly from
his own. In the end, having been admitted an Academician with
out passing through the humbler             grade of Associate, he settled in
 Glasgow,   till he was elected to the Presidency of the Royal Scottish
Academy, on the death of Sir George Harvey in 1876.
    It was in Glasgow, then, that his life-work was really done, and
probably the necessities of
                                    " pot-boiling " dictated the path it
was to follow.       Now and then, for        a season,    indeed,  he sent   for
exhibition some simple rural study — " A Peat Sledge," or " A Burn-
side," or " A Pretty Picture of Children — which had a touch of
                                                     "
pure poetic fancy.      But   these were short flights      into a region  which
he could not afford to cultivate      ;  and ero long he settled down          to
the steady business of portrait painting.          Rembrandt     and Reynolds,
Vandyke and Raeburn, have shown that this may                   be a very  noble
branch    of art  ; and Macneo's portraits         of the late Dr. Wardlaw
and Mr. Dalglcish prove that he had no mean idea of the work                   of
his profession.     But  if painting    was the right vehicle for his genius
to express itself in, we should         have expected to find him rather
following in the wake of Wilkie than of Raeburn, and showing on
his canvass that dramatic power, and insight into Scottish character,
and rarely delicate humour, which were the richest gifts, and most
real qualities of his mind.       Nothing of this, however, can be found
in all his work.       Even in painting portraits,           though  among     so
many he must have come             across    some    faces  which had Scotch
character and humour        like his own, yet       I  am not aware   of any of
his pictures which      suggest    what a wealth of laughter lay in the
man.     It would almost seem as       if  his art was not his natural utter
ance,  but  a mere    skill of hand, and that this successful painter,
after all, had not
                     " found his mission," and has left no real record
of his brilliant genius, except in the short-lived memory of his
friends.    For assuredly, however excellent his likenesses             are, and
howover ably      some   of them     are    painted,    they give no adequato
conception of that singularly rich and fertile and dramatic portrayer
of national character, who could          so nicely    hit off not local dialect
only, but local habits of thought, with strokes of finer insight that
pierced far into the deepest        heart of man.         Of all thi6, however,
nothing now remains.       No other tongue could reproduce those tales.

                                         21
which had      no  plot to speak of, which were at times even               a mere
thread of extravagance, but in which the characters were                  so  felici
tously sketched with touches of such kindly humour, that they
themselves could only have joined heartily in the mirth which they
evoked.      For this was     a marked     feature of his genius     ;   there was
not   a drop   of gall in it.    If  he saw all the oddities      of   a   Glasgow
bailie, an Airdrie miner,       a  Paisley shopkeeper,      a Highland gillie or
drover, or minister, " he handled them             as  if he loved them," and,
indeed, he did like them all the better for the flavour of individual
character they had.
    I would not     be understood      as anywise     undervaluing     his artistic
powers, which were of no mean order, but they certainly would
have attained a still higher rank had his canvas been covered with
 many figures representing the men who lived so vividly in his
stories, and reflecting the dramatic lights in which he could have
placed them.       Most likely this was at first prevented by the                 res
anffusta   domi,    and when        easy times    came    his role was already
determined      for   him.     So he went       on painting portraits      — many
 of them    ; and    making     warm    friends— many of them,           too.    Art
 naturally    drew    to   him Macculloch,         Sam    Bough,    Brodie,      and
 others ; and his rare social qualities          as naturally    associated him
 •with   Outram,    Glassford     Bell, and    Norman      MacLeod.        Brighter
 evenings     there   were    not    in all    Scotland     than   those      which
 brought together the authors of the Annuity and Billy Buttons
 and Daniel Macnee — and the brightest of them all                 was Macnee.
 He was the last of them, too, and perhaps this fact, that he had
 been left alone by these, his dearest friends, made him more willing
 at last to leave Glasgow, and take up the burden of the Presidency,
 even when his own health began to be uncertain.
    How he discharged those duties, and commended himself to all
 his brother artists by hearty kindness and frank recognition of their
 several powers — how he also interested himself in the meetings and
 business of our BoyaJ Society       — how   he soon became as valued a mem
 ber of general society in Edinburgh as he had been                 in Glasgow       ;
 — all this is known     to you alL and all the more is our sorrow that
  his stay among     us was so brief.

     David Anderson of Moredun.               By A. Campbell Swinton
                               of Kimmerghame.
    Mr. David Anderson of Moredun, who died in Edinburgh in his
 ninetieth year, was the eldest son of Mr. Samuel Anderson                   of
 Moredun,      banker in this city, the head of a family many members
 of which have been well known and                 highly  respected.      Mr.
 Anderson       was long    a leading   partner  in the banking house of
 Sir William      Forbes & Company, and when that firm was, in 1838,
 merged in the establishment          now known as the Union        Bank of
 Scotland,     he continued    for many years an active director of the
 new body.        There was no citizen of Edinburgh, whose generous
 aid was more readily given, to every object which commended itself
to his approval as likely to benefit his countrymen of any class or
 condition   ;   and consequently     there is no one whose loss      will  be
more seriously felt, when any measure           of public utility is in con
templation.       He was elected    a Fellow of the Society in 1849, but
never took an active part in its proceedings.           He was, however, a
man of cultivated taste and varied information,          whose warm heart
and genial disposition made him a universal favourite among a large
circle of friends.       And   as one   of the Trustees of Fettes College,
he showed his interest in the higher education of the country by
endowing two scholarships of the annual value of £100 each, with
a view of enabling distinguished         pupils of that school to prosecute
their studies at one or other of the English universities.
         John M'Culloch.             By Francis Brown Douglas.
    Mr. John M'Culloch         was   a native  of Galloway, bom in 1807.
He died    at   Edinburgh 13th     July  1882, in the 76th year of his age.
After attending      classes  at the Glasgow University he came to this
city,  when      he entered    the   British  Linen Company      Bank, and
remained in connection with it for a period of fifty-five years, much
esteemed    for his probity and business habits.        Many   a journey he
undertook to bring gold from London for the bank's purposes, and
to take it back when no longer required.
   He had       a  kindly feeling for the poor and helpless, and was

                                             29
induced, shortly after coming to Edinburgh, to                 become    a  visitor of
the Society for Relief of the Destitute Sick.                   He was appointed
its treasurer, an office he filled for nearly forty years, ever seeking
to promote the usefulness of that institution in his own way, and
to increase     its funds.     He    also   latterly took an active part in the
management         of   St  Cuthbert's Parochial Board, being the more
interested     in this from his connection with the West Kirk                 session,
of which he was an elder for no less than fifty-five years.
      Mr. M'Culloch was admitted              a Fellow of the Royal Society on
 2nd     January 1866, and was          a very regular attender      at its meetings
 —generally,       indeed, present unless prevented by illness.                In his
 later years he was subject to sharp attacks of cold and rheumatism,
 which much impaired his strength and health, and from one of
 which, with other complications, arose his last illness and death.
         Samuel Raleigh, C.A.                By David Maelagau, F.R.S.E.
      Mr.   Samuel Raleigh         was    a   native  of Galloway,     having     been
  bom on a farm near Castle Douglas                held by his father.      His early
  education he obtained in the parish school and liigh school there                    ;
  where    his brother, afterwards        a distinguished  Nonconformist        divine
  iu London,       was   being    trained     at the same     time.    After   a  brief
  apprenticeship      to a local solicitor, Samuel      Raleigh    resolved to go to
  Edinburgh, and seek there some opening which might afford him an
  opportunity     of securing   a position of usefulness and succesa
      He entered the University           as a student at the     Law Classes, and
  at once    made    his mark by carrying off Professor Macvey Napier's
   first Conveyancing      Prize.
       There, as always, he was       a man     of unwearied industry, and        used
   to say that his object in reading systematically the English Classics
   was to acquire a good style of composition.              Those who remember
   his power of expression in writing, either               on   business or more
   general   subjects, will    recognise how successfully          he   achieved his
   purpose.
       Very soon he became partner of Mr. William Campbell of Queens-
    hill, Writer to the Signet, like himself a Galloway man.
        It was very  well known        to   Mr. Raleigh's   friends that his tastes

                                       30
 lay in the direction of figures and finance more than of law alone,
 and that he possessed a singular proficiency in dealing with them.
 The offer therefore of a partnership with Mr. Archibald Borthwick
 — one of the ablest accountants in Edinburgh —was readily accepted
 by him    ; and the partnership     so constituted,  of two men of great
powers, and in very many of their special qualities          the complement
of each other, became      one of the outstanding      firms of Edinburgh,
recognised as such by all professions.         The arrangement, however,
 only lasted until 1857, when the crash of the Western Bank failure
led all interested in that calamity to cast about for suitable         men to
extricate matters, and Baleigh was selected         along with other three,
who are now each at the head of leading Scottish banks.
    The changes in his professional life, which            are not always     a
favourable experience, proved remarkably         so with him.     He got an
insight   in business of quite unwonted range and variety           ;  and he
was just the man to extract and utiliso           the best elements out of
such a career.
    It was not therefore surprising       that when in 1859 the office of
Manager      of the Scottish Widows' Fund Life Assurance Society
became     vacant, the Directors    sought   to secure   his services.     The
offer somewhat perplexed him.          His professional prospects were       so
good that he felt it was a doubtful step to enter upon this new
life, and he asked and obtained time to consider the proposal. After
consultation with friends on whoso judgment he relied, he closed
with the     offer, and became Manager       of a Society which, even at
that time, stood in the very highest rank among Scottish offices,
and which, under his management, was to acquire the position                 of
unapproached pre-eminence which it holds in Great Britain.              It was
not only, however, the large increase of its business which gave
such universal public confidence, but the knowledge of his            skill in
manipulating      and investing large sums of money, and in dovising
and working out the best ways of distributing the very large profits
which accumulated during        each septennial period.
   Although never taking       a public part in political or ecclesiastical
affairs, for which he had little leisure and no tasto,      ho took a deep
interest in all such matters — held very decided views             regarding
them — and was often consulted, and always ready with his counsel
   In  the year 1880 the labours and responsibilities        of his business

                                         si
life began to tell upon him, and ho resigned his appointment                    His
retirement     was of short duration     ;   and he died 26th     July   1 882.
          Professor James Spexce.                By Professor Chiene,
                                M.D., F.R.C.S.E.
     James Spence was born in Edinburgh on tho 31st day of March
 1812.      His father sent him, in the first instance,            to a boarding-
school at Galashiels, and afterwards to the Edinburgh High School.
He entered the University at the             age  of 13, attended     the medical
classes in the University and Extra-mural School, and obtained the
diploma of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1832. His first ambi
tion was to enter the army or navy, and for this purpose he studied
in Paris, and passed the examination for a surgeon in the navy.
 After two voyages to India in troopships, he apparently abandoned
 the idea of public     service,  and settled in Edinburgh.           It  may with
 truth be said that he then (1835)               commenced that career          as a
 teacher and surgeon which           paved the way for his appointmont             as
 Professor of Surgery in 1864.             He first, for seven     years, acted    as
 Demonstrator      of Anatomy to Professor           Monro (tertiue). He then
  taught Anatomy in the Extra-mural School until 1849, when, having
  obtained    the  Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons, he
  became    a Lecturer   on Surgery.       He held this appointment until his
  election as   Professor of Surgery in 1864.            In 1865 ho was made
  Surgeon in Ordinary to the Queen for Scotland.               In 1866 ho became
 a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
      For nearly half   a century James Spence was intimately             associated
  with the teaching of Anatomy and Surgery in this city.                   From the
  very first he adopted       a  course    of self-education, and under many
  difficulties he gradually but surely made his way to the front ; and
  at the time of his death (June 1882) he had attained a position in
  which he was esteemed by all as the representative of Scottish
  Surgery.     He   possessed    most marked manipulative           skill,  and   was
  a very successful practitioner.
      He has left,   as a result of his long practical experience, a most
   valuable work on the Practice of Surgery.             To tracheotomy, hernio
   tomy,   the ligature of      vessels,   urinary   diseases,   and   methods of

                                      32
amputation, he paid special attention, and has done much to advance
our knowledge.
   James Spence is an example of       a man who slowly rose to eminence
by earnest, honest work.      He will be remembered         as a teacher  who
had always something worth telling on every practical question, and
•who   told it in  a way easily remembered.        His systematic lectures
were essentially clinical.
    Much loved by those who knew him           best, his memory      will long
remain    in the    Edinburgh school      as a  faithful    teacher, a good
operator, and a kind friend.
       Frederick Hallard.           By Thomas M'Kie, Advocate.
    Frederick Hallard, Advocate,       senior   Sheriff-Substitute    of Mid-
Lothian, died in this city on 12th January            1882, aged    sixty -one.
 His  father was a soldier  in the French army, who, after the Revolu
tion of 1793, emigrated to this country,            and, along with other
 Royalist   refugees, took up his abode in Edinburgh as           a teacher of
his native language.       Here he married, lived, and died.          His son
 Frederick was born in this city in May        1821.    At   the age of four,
he was taken to Avranches,        his paternal home in Xormandy ; and
there, and at Paris, ho received a sound and liberal education.             At
sixteen he returned to Edinburgh.          The strong affection     he always
had for the city of his birth arose not more from admiration of its
material beauty, than out of regard for its intellectual         renown, and
the friendly intercourse which existed between it and France in the
olden time. Being destined for the Scotch bar, young Hallard attended
the usual classes at the University of Edinburgh, and proved himself
a  diligent and distinguished     student.     He was admitted to the bar
in 1844, joined the Speculative Society, and after acting for some
years as a reporter on the Jurist, he was, in 1855, appointed by the
late    Sheriff Gordon     junior   Sheriff-Substitute     for Mid-Lothian.
From that time until his death,          he discharged    the duties of his
office  with  a manly independence      of spirit and judicial integrity of
purpose, rarely equalled.     The year before his judicial appointment,
he married Mary Carr Robertson, a daughter of the late Mr. James
 Robertson of this city.     The marriage was one of affection, and for

                                                33
many         years was a source       of uninterrupted          happiness.      But of the
nine      children bom of the marriage,                death carried       off three in as
many         months    :  shortly afterwards,       the grave      was again     opened     to
receive his beloved           wife, and in      1873 he had yet again to follow to
the tomb his eldest son, Frederick,                 a' youth of great brightness and
promise.          Against this overwhelming affliction Mr. Hallard bore up
outwardly with manly fortitude                   ; but those who knew             him best
knew too well            how the    sad   ruin of his       once happy home         haunted
his memory,          and bowed to the earth             a   spirit shrinkingly sensitive
and keenly affectionate.              It  was then that he truly felt the consola
tions of       philosophy      ; for  he had loved letters from his early youtli
with      a  devotion which grew with his growth, strengthened with his
manhood, and             continued with him to the             end.    His literary     tastes
had adorned and brightened                  his life in the times of prosperity, and
when        the   sorrowful days came, these tastes weaned him from him
self, and        gave him comfort, if not consolation.                  One charm of his
 society was,       that along with a love for all things lovely and of good
 report,      he   united in a singular manner, in his own person, two
 separate nationalities.            For his intimate acquaintance with French
 literature,       history,   politics,    and jurisprudence          was     happily    com
 bined      with   a  wide knowledge of, and           a  lively interest in, everything
 pertaining to the literature and jurisprudence                     of our own country.
  To his other accomplishments he added                      a  keen relish for classical
  studies, and particularly          Greek.
       Besides     doing his judicial duties, Mr. Hallard for many years,
  and until       his   death, acted as a Director of the Philosophical               Institu
   tion, and took an active part in the management                     of its affairs.     The
   useful work         he did    there   cannot be better summarised            than in the
   words of its Vice-President,          Dr. William Smith, who             at a meeting     of
   ttie  Directors of that Institution thus spoke of Mr. Hallard :— " We
   can call     to mind how much his fine tastes, his varied culture, and
   his active       helpfulness, his ready aid, always willing and gracefully
   rendered, have contributed to our success.                    Associated with him         as
    I  have been      for nearly thirty years, no one knows better than                   I do
   how much we have               been indebted to him          in  these respects;     and   I
   had    looked forward to the time when you might permit me to retire
   from     this chair, which by your favour and indulgence                I have   occupied
    so  long, and called on him to          fill it with new and        fresh efficiency."
                                                                                    c

                                           34
     Mr. Halkrd       became a   Fellow of the Royal Society on twenty-first
 January 1867. He was proud of its diploma, pretty constant
,in his attendance at its meetings, but never read a paper, nor took
 part in the debates.        This was partly owing to       an inherent modesty
 of nature, and partly         because   his knowledge      and the bent of his
  mind were much more literary and                philosophical   than scientific
  He published        several able pamphlets      on legal topics, one of them
  being entitled
                     " The Inferior Judge," and he took          a prominent        in
  terest in all questions affecting a reform of the law.                Apart from
  these he    did not write much       ;  yet what he did write showed such
  vivacity,    grace,   and culture,   that, like the aroma of good wine,            it
  served but to whet the appetite and to make one wish he had
  written more.         But that was not to be     ;  and so he has passed away
  from among us, still to be held in fond remembrance by a wide circle
   of friends.
                 Dk. John Muik.             By Professor Eggeliiig.
      Dr. John Muir, who died on the 7th of March last,                was   born at
   Glasgow     on the 5th February 1810, being the eldest son of                   Mr.
   William Muir,       at one time a magistrate of that city.     After receiving
   his    early education      at the    grammar school       of Irvine and the
   University of Glasgow, ho         passed    to Haileybury College, then the
   training institution for the civil servants of the East India Com
   pany.     In   1828 he proceeded to India, and, having              passed     with
   distinction through the College of Fort William,                and served for
   some years as assistant secretary to the          Board of Eevenue       at    Alla
   habad, and afterwards         as a commissioner       for investigating     claims
   to hold land rent free in the Meerut              Division, he    was appointed
   magistrate and collector at Azimgurh.               During his occupancy of
   these posts (a period       of  some    fifteen years) he always devoted            a
   large portion of his leisure to the study of Sanscrit           literature   ;  and
   so  well did he     succeed  in mastering the language, that          he  himself
   composed several treatises         in Sanskrit metre and          prose,   viz.,    a
   description of England, a sketch of the history             of India, and two
   treatises setting forth the essentials of the Christian doctrines               and
   ethics  ; and delivered to the students of Sanskrit at Benares lectures
   in that language on mental philosophy, and kindred subjects (1843).

                                              35
       In 1844     the combination         of the hitherto     separate    Sanskrit and
English        colleges at Benares was resolved upon, and               John Muir was
appointed first principal of the institution.             In    an address delivered
by the Hon. James Thomason, Lieut.-Governor of the                          N.W.P., at
the opening        of the Benares Xew College, on 11th January 1853,
credit is given to Mr.           Muir for having      succeeded      " in introducing
into the college a stricter discipline and a better system of educa
tion."        This post John Muir held for one year, when he was suc
ceeded        by Dr. Ballantyne, he himself reverting to the judicial
branch        of the service, as civil and session judge at Futtehpore.
From his parting address to the students of the Benares College, on
the 10th                  I extract the following passages as charac
               February 1843,
teristic of the man           :—I am anxious that your reasonable
                                 " Now,
ambition should be satisfied ; I desire to see you all rise to wealth
and honour ; but I am more solicitous that high principles should
now be implanted in your minds, which in after life may bear the
precious fruits of integrity,          wisdom, and piety.           I   wish that you
should be devoted to study, not so much for the outward advantages
it brings,      as because you love that        truth to which it ought to lead              ;
because       you appreciate the most valuable           results of education,            I
mean      intelligence,       enlargement of mind,      the cultivation             of your
judgment         and    other    faculties; acquaintance with the wonderful
works of God, and the laws by which He rules the universe                       ;
                                                                                    — above
all, because you find that sound instruction is auxiliary to moral
improvement.            These are the motives         which best deserve to be
urged at length            to stimulate you to the earnest pursuit of know
ledge."        After   a   brief outline of   some   of the chief departments of
Sanskrit literature, he continues : — " There            is,   however, one subject
which, more than any other, demands your earnest attention, both
during        the course of your education and after its close                 I
                                                                               ;      mean
your moral improvement.               If   the instruction you have received in
the college have not inspired you with the love of goodness,                    of truth,
integrity, justice, purity, and piety, as well as with              a     desire to prac
tise    all    these   virtues   which in theory you admire,              it   will have
effected but      little.    Mere intellectual, unattended by moral improve
ment, may render you             only more accomplished in wickedness.                True
wisdom cannot exist apart from goodness.                  However          strengthened
by discipline your powers may be, they                will always         be directed to

                                        36
the attainment       of ignoble or comparatively insignificant objects,
if they    are  not guided and hallowed by virtuous principle.               True
self respect, real happiness, the blessing of God, and your everlast
ing welfare, all depend on you strictly regulating your lives accord
ing to the dictates of conscience and the Divine will."
    In    1854, having     completed     his term     of service, John       Muir
returned     to England, and, after       a  brief residence in London, he
settled permanently       in Edinburgh.         During his last few years in
India his earlier literary attempts at religious subjects were followed
up by a      Life of the Apostle Paul, and an Examination nf Religion,
both of them in Sanscrit         verse,  with English (the former treatise
also with Bengali and Hindi) translations.             The deep interest which
he always took, not only in the moral improvement of the Hindus,
but in religious and theological matters generally, led him, in later
years, to offer to the University of Cambridge a prize of £500 for
the best exposition       of the errors of Indian philosophy, and the
principles     of Christianity in a form suitable for learned Hindus ;
and to the University of Glasgow a prize of £100 for proficiency               in
Hebrew scholarship, open         to all Scottish     graduates in arts of not
more than six years' standing.           It  also prompted     him, some years
since, to endow, for a period           of five   years,  a lectureship   on the
 Comparative Science of Religion in the University of Edinburgh.
 Moreover, it induced him to take up the systematic study of the
 religious literature of India, and the writings of modern European
 theologians.      The results of many years of unwearied research were
laid down in      a numbor of papers,     mostly contributed to the      Journal
of    the   Royal Asiatic Society, and ultimately             collected  in four
 volumes of       Original Sanskrit Texts        on the    Origin and History
 nf   the   People   of India, their Religion and Institutions.              This
 work, of which        a revised   and greatly      enlarged    edition,  in five
 volumes, was published        in 1868-70, forms by far the most com
 plete and trustworthy digest of authentic               texts  bearing   on  the
 growth of the Brahmanical doctrines and institutions.               The amount
 of patient, methodical       research   with which the various religious
 conceptions of the ancient Hindus            are   traced by him from their
 first germs     through   tho various phases of development;            and the
 impartial spirit with which he reproduces and examines the often
 conflicting views of European scholars on single points of Hindu

tradition,     are beyond        all praise.     His English translation         of the
frequently obscure texts,              as a   German scholar         has   justly said,
" betrays                      a master's  hand."     To insure accuracy in his
              throughout
interpretation of difficult           passages,    Muir would        save   himself no
trouble,     but would write letters upon letters to Sanskrit scholars
who he thought might                be   able to clear up his         difficulties.      I
hav3 sometimes heard             it remarked that, in dealing with important
questions,     Muir too often contents himself with stating the conflict
ing views of others, without giving any decided opinion of his own
one way      or the other, when he            was  at least as competent as any
other scholar        to pronounce on these         points.     To    a certain    extent
this is no doubt true          ;  but it is only what might be expected from
 so cautious and conscientious an inquirer,             whose sole aim was to get
 at the   truth   ;  and who, while ever anxious to allow every one a fair
 hearing, shrank instinctively from committing                 himself     to a definite
 alternative where the available data appeared to him insufficient                     for
 forming a conviction.             His mind, indeed, was singularly open to
 argument ; it was as free fiom preconceived                 ideas as it was disin
 clined to hasty conclusions.            As in his literary inquiries regarding
 the   bygone       ages    of Indian belief, so in his own religious views,
 which,    it would      seem, were somewhat modified,            in his latter    years,
  by a close   study of modern theological writings.              Liberty of    research
 and teaching,       in whatsoever department of human                 science,  was    to
  him an article of        faith, which neither his natural          reserve, nor out
  side considerations       of any kind, could keep him from vindicating.             The
  powerful impetus imparted to the study of the Vedic texts,                        some
  thirty years ago, gave rise to an animated discussion as to the degree
  of authority to be assigned to the traditionary interpretation                  of the
  sacred lyrics,      as handed      down in the native commentaries.                Into
  this literary warfare        Muir threw himself with the full weight of his
  scholarship,   in    a  manner showing how well he knew to fight for the
  principle of free research, so dear to him.            A   distinguished      Sanskrit
  scholar   had given        his opinion       to the   effect   that " in the pre
  sent stage     of Vaidik         studies   in Europe,     it  seemed      to him the
   safer course     to follow native tradition rather than to accept                   too
   readily the arbitrary       conjectures which Continental         scholars so often
   hazard."    This remark drew forth, after           a few weeks,       Muir's excel
                " On the Interpretation of the Yeda             "
   lent paper                                                      (Jour, of the Roy.

                                         38
 Asiatic Soc., 1866).      Writing with more warmth than he usually
 displayed in his writings, he therein proved conclusively that it is
a mistake to speak of an unbroken               chain of Hindu tradition, the
 meaning of the Veda having           already become largely obscure by the
 time a school of exegesis        arose ; and that,      therefore, the scholars
 alluded to (viz., Koth and his school) were quite justified in eman
cipating themselves from the trammels of native tradition, and
 calling into requisition     all the other available resources of philo
logy, thereby laying the foundation            of  a true interpretation     of the
 Veda.
    After the completion of the second edition of the Oriijim.il San
skrit   Texts,  Dr. Muir was by no             means   satisfied to rest on     hij
laurels.    He continued his studies           as assiduously as ever,      though
perhaps with a less definite object in view ; printing from time to
time, for private distribution,       small collections      of metrical transla
tions of characteristic passages he met with in his reading, generally
 of a moral or religious tendency.        These were ultimately published,       in
a collected form,   in  a volume    of Triibner's Oriental    series, with parallel
 passages from the     Bible and classical authors.         In his interesting in
troduction, he discusses the difficult question as to whether an ac
quaintance with the Christian Scriptures              may have exercised some
influence on the religious        ideas of the Hindus in the earlier can-
turies of our era ; an influence             which has     been    asserted  to be
traceable more especially in the Bhagavad-gita, the famous philoso
phical episode of the Mahabharata.              Although Muir      does not  arrive
at any definite conclusion on this point, he seems, on the whole, to
incline to the assumption of an independent               origin of the work in
question.      The particular     object    he had in view in making this
collection may best be stated in his own word6 : — " But however th«
question of the obligations        of the Bhagavad-gita, or of          some other
parts of the Mahabharata,           to Christianity may          be   decided, the
decision can scarcely affect the determination of the farther and very
different   question of     the originality or otherwise,           as far as any
foreign influences are concerned, of the great bulk of the moral and
religious sentiments embraced in my collection.                 Theso sentiments
and observations      are   the natural       expression   of the feelings and
experiences of universal humanity           ;  and the higher and nobler por
tion of them cannot be regarded as peculiar to Christianity.                   The

                                        no
correctness of this view is placed beyond a doubt by the parallels
 which   I have   adduced from classical writers.        It  is my impression,
however, that the sentiments of humanity, mercy, forgiveness, and
unselfishness are more natural to the Indian than to the Greek and
Roman authors, unless, perhaps, in the case of those of the latter
who were influenced by philosophical speculation.              This tenderness
of Indian sentiment may possibly have been in part derived from
Buddhism, which, however, itself was of purely Indian growth."
The publication of this volume seems to have left a void in his mind
which,   deepened     by the los3 of his good and gentle sister, who had
been for many years the faithful companion of his solitary life, had
at times   a depressing influence      on his spirits.      Still, however,   he
pursued his      course  of reading, and only a few months before his
death he    issued to his friends    another small collection of metrical
translations from the Mahabharata,           including the highly poetical
episode of Savitri.
   While the literary     researches  of John Muir have gained for him
a place   in the foremost rank of Sanskritists, and have thus contri
buted in    a remarkable degree     to the credit of Scottish       scholarship
in an important branch of Oriental studies — as those of his dis
tinguished brother, Sir William Muir, have done in another branch
—John Muir deserves to be not less gratefully remembered by his
countrymen      for the eminent services he has rendered to the cause of
education in Scotland.       The want of    a recognised medium of      insljuc-
tion on his favourite subjects of study in any of the Scottish uni
versities   induced    him,  in  1862,   to offer to the Senatus of the
Edinburgh University the sum of £4000 for the foundation of                    a
chair   of Sanskrit     and Comparative      Philology;     on the condition
that the interest of this capital        should    be  supplemented      by an
annual grant from Government of the same amount.                  In  1876 this
munificent gift was increased by a further sum yielding an addition
to the emoluments of the chair of £50 a year.              In  one respect   Dr.
Muir's expectations in founding the chair were disappointed.                  It
appears that, in drawing up the deed of endowment, he had intended
to provide, beside the systematic courses of instruction,            for annual
courses   of lectures of   a more   popular kind to be open to any non-
 matriculated persons that might         wish to attend them.          Unfortu
 nately, however, the terms of the deed were not sufficiently definite

                                              40
to exclude an interpretation                more   in harmony with the existing
arrangements of university teaching                ; and, though the question was
long and carefully considered hy the Senatus —                  I  myself deeming it
my duty to support Dr. Muir's interpretation                  — they found it impos
sible to consent to what might have proved                 a somewhat inconvenient
precedent.        Nevertheless, Dr.          Muir continued to the last to show
the warmest interest          in the objects of the chair, by giving annual
prizes for distinguished           attainment     in the several    classes.     He also
offered   a   (still available) prize of £100 to the first student that
should take the degree of Doctor of Science in the department of
Sanskrit and Comparative                 Philology.     To his liberality the       Uni
versity Library owes a very considerable portion                      of its Oriental
and Philological        books.         The connection        of his name with our
University, in this          respect,      has been   further strengthened, since
his death, through tho presentation, by Sir "William Muir, of the
large    collection    of    Oriental       and   Philological books left by his
brother.      In   accepting this splendid gift, the Library Committee
resolved that this collection,              together with the books           previously
presented by Dr. Muir, should                 be kept separate     from the general
library, under the designation of the " Muir Collection."                      Dr.  Muir
also took a prominent part             in the founding, in 1868, of the Shaw
scholarship in mental philosophy               (in honour of his uncle, Sir John
Shaw, at one        time Lord Mayor of London, and a director of the
EasJ;   India Company)           ;   and in     originating    and    conducting     the
Association     for Promoting            the Better Endowment of Edinburgh
University, having          acted     for ten years      as honorary        secretary of
that most useful society.            Dr. Muir's interest and liberality        were not,
however, confined to the University of Edinburgh                      ;  but the other
Scottish     universities      also,   I  bolieve, received from him numerous
donations of books        ;   and to the Berlin University he presented, a
few months before his death, the sum of £50, to form the nucleus
for a scholarship in Sanskrit             philology.    In recognition of his        ser
vices to higher education, Dr.                Muir was appointed          a  member of
the last Scottish       Universities Commksion.               To the report of the
commissioners Dr. Muir, in accordance                  with his principles, added
a  note urging the consideration of the advisability               of   the theological
chairs in the universities           being thrown     open to members of all the
churches.

    John Mai^s eminence         as a scholar obtained      for him the honorary
degrees     of D.C.L.    from the Oxford University,             of LL.D.    from
the Edinburgh University, and of Doctor of Philosophy from                     the
University of Bonn       ;  as well as the title of a corresponding member
of   the French Academy,         the Koyal Prussian      Academy of Sciences,
and    a foreign member      of the Leyden Society for the Cultivation of
Dutch Literature.         He joined the Koyal Society of Edinburgh in
1861, and at their meeting on Feb. 16, 1863, he read, by request
of the Council, a highly interesting paper " On the Recent Progress
of Sanskrit Studies." This and several other papers contributed by
hiiu were published in the Society's Transactions.
    John Muir was loved by all who knew him for his extreme kind-
heirtedness and truthfulness, his love of humanity, and the purity
of his life.     His memory ought        to be dear to every Scotsman.
  Dr. Charles Morehead.                  By James Sanderson, F.RC.S.E.,
      Deputy Inspector-General             of Hospitals, Madras Army.
     Dr. Charles    Morehead,       CLE, MD.           Edin.,   F.R.C.P. Lond.,
and Honorary Surgeon            to Her Majesty,        was born in Edinburgh
in 1807, and died suddenly            at  Wilton Castle, Redcar, Yorkshire,
on the 24th of August         1882,  in the 75th year of his       age.  He   was
 the second son of         the Rev.      Robert Morehead,        D.D.,  Dean    of
 Edinburgh, and afterwards rector of Easington,                 Yorkshire.    His
 mother was Margaret,         daughter of the Rev.        Charles Wilson, Pro
 fessor of Church History in the University of St. Andrews.
    He was educated at the High School of Edinburgh, for whicli
 through life he cherished       a  strong affection, and at the time of his
death was one of the very few remaining members of the Carson
 Club.     He entered the medical        classes  in the University of Edin
 burgh    about   1825, where ho distinguished           himself    as a student
more particularly     in the    science    classes.   In  the early part of his
studies he manifested great ardour in the study of clinical medicine,
and soon attracted the attention of Professor Alison, whose clerk he
became     at the end  of his  course.
    Dr. Morehead graduated as          M.D. in 1828, and thereafter        prose
cuted his medical studies for upwards of            a  year in PaTis, under the

                                        42
famous physician Louis, with whom he kept up an intimate corres-
pondenoe     till his death.
    At the    age of 22, Dr.     Morehead     entered the Bombay         Medical
Service, and was soon placed on the personal staff of Sir Robert
Grant, Governor of Bombay, and continued to serve in that capacity
till Sir Bobert's death in 1838.          He was president of the Medical
and Physical Society of Bombay from 1837 to 1859, and during
that time contributed        largely   to the Transactions       of the Society.
Ho acted also as secretary to the Board of Native Education from its
establishment in 1840 to 1845.           In connection with this last subject
he   long    ably advocated in       various    ways,    and  through     various
channels,     the opinion     that tbe instruction       and education of the
natives of India should bo through             the medium of the English
language   ;   and at last,   in 1845, had the satisfaction of         seeing  his
ideas   carried    into practical   effect  in the founding of the Grant
Medical      College,   one   of the chief      features of which was          the
education of the natives by means           of   the  English   language.     The
practice has now for long been universally adopted, with the best
results, both as regards the governors and governed of our Indian
 Empiro.
    About this time, the large and well-equipped               native    hospital,
named after Sir Jamsetjee          Jejoebhoy,     was  established at the    joint
 expense   of the Government and Sir Jamsetjee, for practical instruc
 tion in clinical teaching.        To Dr. Morehead belongs the merit of
 introducing     this branch of medical training, which at that time did
 not form a regular         part of the curriculum        even in the medical
 schools of the United Kingdom.                It    was  but  fitting  that    Dr.
  Morehead was appointed first Principal and first Professor of Medi
 cine to the College, and first Physician to the Hospital
     A  bust of Dr. Morehead           has  been    placed in the hall      of the
  College  as, a  memorial of its eminent Principal and Professor, by the
  students and friends of the college.
     During    these years Dr. Morehead was patiently          collecting   in the
  course, of    his practice as a ph3Tsician,        and from     other available
  sources, observations on the diseases        of India, the results of which
  he published       in his valuable work on Indian            Dix^ases,   a book
  which still holds its place as     a  standard authority in the treatment
  of the tropical diseases    of Hindostan.       His last service to the pro

                                      43
 fession,   before leaving    India   for   England     in   1859,   was    the
 characteristic  one of the formation of    a society composed of the old
students of the Grant College, which has           served not merely as       a
bond of union, but    been also productive of no inconsiderable practical
advantages to its members.
    On his return from India       ho   was offered    the professorship     of
medicine in Netley Hospital, then just founded, which, however, the
state of his health obliged him to decline.
    In  1862, he retired   from the service with the rank          of Deputy
Inspector-General    of Hospitals ;  in 1857 he was appointed Honorary
Surgeon to the Queen, and in       1881 was made       a Companion     of the
Order of the Indian Empire.
    Dr. Morehead will      be long   and best known by his important
researches    into the diseases of India, based        on a truly scientific
diagnosis, and so successfully set forth in his great work on the
subject   ; and by the insight and strength of        will by which he    suc
ceeded in making clinical medicine so prominent            a feature   of  the
medical education of natives in Western India.
    It  only remains to add that in 1875 Dr. Morehead published the
Memorials of the Life and Writings of his Father, the Eev. Dr.
Robert Morehead.        He was elected    a Fellow of this Society on the
 15th January 1860.
              Friedrich WOhler.         By Professor Dittmar.
    On the 23rd of September 1882, this great man closed his          eyes to
go to rest after a noble and glorious career     in  the service of chemical
science, extending     over two generations.        Some sixty years ago,
when    the elementary nature of chlorine       had just been established
and the isolation    of cyanogen was still      a novelty,   young Wohler
already worked as     an investigator, — the   same   Wohler who rejoiced
with us over the synthesis of indigo.           Of the world of chemical
discoveries that lie between he magna pars fuit.
   To desire to know something of the mould of external circum
stances into which such a great life was cast is no vulgar curiosity.
The writer, accordingly, had no hesitation in availing himself of an
opportunity     which presented itself    .some   time ago for obtaining

                                         44
  authentic information      from Mr. A. Wohler of Schonhof of Bocken-
 heim, the great chemist's only son.          From Mr. Wohler's letter we
 extract the following biographical sketch        : —
     Fricdrich Wohler      was born on the 31st   July   1800, in Eschorsheim,
 a  village near Frankfort-on-the-Main.         He received his first instruc
 tion from his father, a man well versed in economical and physical
 science, as also   in philosophy and pedagogics ; and, besides, attended
 the village school in Rbdelheim, where his father owned a small
 landed estate.        In  1812 the family removed to Frankfurt, where
 he attended the gymnasium, and by the kindness of a scientific friend,
 Dr. Buch, who, besides a thorough knowledge of the subjects, possessed
the necessary appliances, was introduced to the study of mineralogy,
 more     especially, but also of chemistry and physics.            [Conjointly
with this Dr. Buch, Wohler,          as early as 1821, published     an investi
gation on "Selenium           in  a Bohemian     mineral," —his    debut   as an
investigator.]         After   having   completed    his curriculum       at the
 gymnasium, Wohler went to the University of Marburg as a student
of medicine.        In   1821   he left Marburg to continue his studies at
Heidelberg,      where he took his degree as doctor of medicine but,
on the advice of Leopold           Gmelin, decided upon devoting himself
henceforth to chemistry.          He completed his chemical education at
Stockholm       under Berzelius,    in whose laboratory he worked for            a
considerable time, and with whom, during              his subsequent life, he
maintained      the most friendly relations.       Wliile in Sweden      he took
part in     a scientific expedition     through  Norway, which       made    him
acquainted with the brothers Brogniart and Humphrey Davy.
    After his return from Sweden, in 1825, he accepted a call to Berlin
as teacher of chemistry       in the then newly-erected Gewerbschule,and
remained there until 1832, when family affairs caused             him to takt»
up     his abode     in Cassel.    In   1836  Wohler     became   Professor    of
Chemistry in the Medical          Faculty of the University of Gottingen,
which office, in his case,     was combined with that of Inspector-General
of Pharmacy for Hanover.           He held his chair to the day of his death
on the 23rd September 1882.            After only three days illness he died,
deeply mourned by his widow, children,            grand children, and great-
grand children, in the 83rd year of his life.
   To    pass now to what for us, as part of the republic        of  science,  is
Winder's real biography.

                                          45
    The superabundance of experimental geniu9 in the chemical camp
must     account for the fact that the border-lands         between chemistry
proper and the collateral sciences of physics, physiology,             &c, have
been cultivated chiefly by men who called themselves chemists.                   It
is there    that Bunsen,       Graham,    Kopp, Liebig, Eegnault,       gathered
part of    their laurels.     If  it were possible to characterise Wohler by
one stroke    of the    pen,  we should say that of such border-land work
he did very      little — all his work lies in the very    core of the science     ;
but on this    only relatively narrow field he simply ranks with Scheele,
no other name, except perhaps              that of Berzelius,    could fitly be
placed alongside of these two.
    To begin with Wohler's minor contributions,               and at the same
time   qualify what      we have    just said of him in   a negative sense, let
us state    that Wohler, while        a student of   medicine in Heidelberg,
published a thesis on the excretion of substances by the kidneys,
for which a prize was awarded to him by the Medical Faculty of that
University      in 1823.       Many years later he resumed this subject
conjointly with Frerichs ; the memoir is in the Annalcn der Chitnie
 for 1848    (vol. lxv. p. 325).       In this connection we may state that
 we owe    to Wohler the best method for the detection of arsenic and
 other mineral       poisons in complex organic mixtures.        It  is described
 shortly in his Mineral Analyse in Beitpielen.            (The original memoir
 is in the Annalen,      for 1849, vol. lxix. p. 364.)
     We have not been able to find out exactly what Wohler did
while in Berzelius's laboratory, and presume that, as a sensible man,
 he there     mainly confined himself         to learning    the great master's
methods.       Nothing but       a short notice on     "Improvements in the
 Preparation       of Potassium,"     dates from  the Stockholm       period.     It
 is significant, however, as forming the small beginning            of a  brilliant
 series of researches     on the isolation of elementary substances and their
 properties, a subject for which he evidently had a great love, as he
 always comes back to it in the intervals of other work.             In  1827 he,
  for the first time, succeeded in isolating aluminium, the metal of clay,
 by means of a method which was soon found to be more generally ap
  plicable.    Alumina, like many other metallic oxides, is not reducible
  by electrolysis or by the action of charcoal at any temperature.             But,
  when heated with charcoal in chlorine gas,        it passes into the   state of a
   volatile chloride.     What Wohler found was that this chloride when

                                                        46
heated with potassium or sodium, readily gives up its chlorine                                         and
assumes the elementary form.                            The aluminium which Wohler thus
obtained was a grey powder;                          but in 1845 he       succeeded      in producing
the metal               in the       shape      of     well-fused,     fully metallic         globules.
Wohler, on this second occasion, correctly ascertained all the pro
perties which everybody                         now knows          to be characteristic         of this
metal, and it is as well to add that where Wohler's aluminium
differed from what now occurs in commerce                                   under this name, it
differed to its own advantage.                          That Wohler should not have                  seen
the practical                importance of his discovery,                 is what       we refuse to
believe       ;   if   he never even suggested               an attempt to manufacture                 the
metal industrially, this is the natural consequence                                 of the circum
stances           in which        he was placed.             For    these   we    now should           feel
thankful          ;    if,   instead of quiet little Gbttingen,             a   place   like Birming
ham had been                   his     abode,     he would,        perhaps, have been           lost    to
science for            all the rest of his life.
     The earlier              aluminium         research     was    followed,     in 1828, by the
isolation of beryllium and yttrium.                           These earlier metal reductions
fall into the Berlin period. While in Cassel he worked out pro
cesses for the manufacture of nickel free from arsenic, and this laid
the foundation                 for what      is   now   a   flourishing     chemical industry in
Germany.                The several methods for the                    analysis of nickel and
cobalt ores which                 he describes in his Mineral-Analyse are, we pre
sume, an incidental                  outcome of this work.             This subject was one of
his favourite                topics;    as late as 1877 we see him coming back to                       it
in the publication of                   a   short cut for the separation of nickel and
cobalt from arsenic and iron.
     In    1849          metallic       titanium       arrested his attention.               Since     the
days of Wollaston those beautiful                              copper-like       cubes      which      are
occasionally met with in blown-out blast furnaces, had been                                          sup
posed      to be metallic titanium pure and simple.                              Wohler observed
that the reputed metal, when                           fused with caustic alkali, emitted
torrents of ammonia, and on further inquiry ascertained the crystals
to be     a   ternary compound, containing                     the elements of          a   nitride and
of   a   cyanide of the metal.                    In    pursuance of this research             Wohler
taught us how to prepare real titanium and really pure titanic acid.
     In   1854 Deville's energetic attempts to produce aluminium                                       in
dustrially,           caused     Wohler to turn his attention again to this early

                                        47
and almost     forgotten child of his genius.            His first incentive, no
doubt, was the natural and        just desire to claim his right          as the real
discoverer   of what Deville, in his ignoranco of foreign                    scientific
work,   quite    honestly    thought      he had      been     the first      to find
out.    This   priority dispute       came     to   a  very    satisfactory       issue.
Deville, after a little pardonable hesitation,            bravely acknowledged
Wohler's priority, and the two henceforth were friends and worked
together.
   The first fruit of this happy union               was  a  memorable joint re
search (published     in  1856    and 1857), which led to their discovery
of an adamantine       and of a graphitoidal         — in addition       to the long
known    amorphous —modification          of boron.     This graphitoidal       species
subsequently     (in their    own     hands)     proved     a  mistake     ;  but    the
adamantine     modification     lives   to   this day    as a true      analogue of
ordinary (carbon) diamond.
   From boron to silicon is an easy                transition,    so we      need    not
wonder at    finding "Wohler, in 1857,           engaged     (conjointly with the
physicist Buff) in a research         on new compounds of silicon.                    On
electrolysing    a solution    of common salt with silicon             — containing
aluminium, as a positive electrode, they obtained               a  self-inflammable
gas  which they recognised as hydrogen contaminated with the pre
viously unknown         hydride     of silicon     SiH4,    which body "Wohler
subsequently (with the co-operation of Martius) obtained in a state
of greater purity.       "Wohler and Buff also obtained, though in an
impure    state, what were subsequently             recognised by Friedel and
Ladenburg as silicon-chloroform           and as silicon-formic      anhydride.
   Within the limits of this notice we could not reasonably attempt
anything like     a complete   account of Wohler's numerous researches on
inorganic subjects ; but we must not omit to at least allude to his
researches on metallic or semi-metallic nitrides,               "What we know of
this as yet little understood class of bodies, with barely an exception,
came out of his laboratory,         if it  was not done by himself               in the
strict sense of the word.
   We    also can only refer to the numerous processes              which Wohler,
in  the course of his long laboratory practice, has worked                 out for the
 preparation    of   pure    chemicals,      and for the execution of exact
 analytical separations.      Wohler had better things to do than to take
 up analytical problems for their own sake ; but what he did in this

                                                43
  direction incidentally — with his left hand,               so to say,    while his right
  was engaged in greater            work — amounts       to a great deal.        "With the
  two exceptions        of Heinrich       liose and Robert Bunsen, no man has
  done more than        Wohler      has for the perfection of analytical methods.
 The analysis of meteorites was one of his favourite specialties, and
  one of his results        in   regard    to these must not be withheld            from a
  Scottish Society.          We    refer to his discovery of organic           matter in    a
  meteorite which he examined               in  1804.
      If Wohler       had    done    nothing more than what has been referred
  to  explicitly or implicitly in the above, his work, even for the fifty
 years of unbroken            health which        Providence     granted      him for its
 execution,     would have to be admitted to be both multa and mullum ;
 but far more important               than even all that are his researches in
 organic    ehem   istry,
      Wohler's     first organic research          dates    from 1821,       when     (as   a
 student      in    Heidelberg)        he    discovered     persuJphocyanic        acid,    a
 compound of sulphur with the sulphocyanic acid                         which, the year
 before, had been analysed              by Berzelius.       But fraught with greater
 consequences        was his discovery of cyanic acid               in   1822.     Organic
 chemistry might be said to date from it in two senses.                         "When,     in
  1828,    Wohler       prepared      the amnionic       salt   of his acid,       he   was
 astonished      to find that the salt, although made by what appeared
 to be a straight- for ward         double decomposition,          did not exhibit       the
 character     of an ammonia          salt at all, but turned out to be identical
 with urea,      a substance       which heretofore       had    been    known only        as
 one of the organic components                 of urine.     A   momentous       discovery
 for that time      !   A wide and        impassable     gulf then,     in  the minds     of
 chemists,     separated       the   mineral from the organic            kingdom.         In
 organic    bodies     all appeared       to be derivable from their elements             by
 a succession     of acts of binary combination           ;  the  full analysis of such
 a   body contained        in itself the full instruction            for its synthetical
 production in the laboratory.                  Organic substances,         on  the   other
 hand, were supposed             to be things       of an entirely different order;
 in    them   the few elements           which they all consist of, were assumed
 to be united with one another,                  each  with each, in a mysterious
 manner,     which could be brought about only by the agency of vital
force.     Vital     force,   it  was now       seen, had nothing         to do   with   the
 formation of urea at any rate.                 The gulf was bridged over, and              a

                                            49
great and new morning              full of the highest promise dawned over
chemistry.        If the promise was more than fulfilled, if organic
chemistry      from   a mere   possibility developed into       a reality, we owe
this chiefly to the great researches         which were carried out conjointly
by   Wohler and Liebig.
   Two years after Wohler had discovered cyanic acid, Liebig and
Gay-Lussac inquired into the nature of that dangerously explosive
compound        known     as fulminate      of mercury (which had been dis
covered twenty-four        years   before by Howard), and proved it to be the
mercuric salt      of an acid which, although clearly         a  thing of its own
kind, had precisely         the same elementary composition           as WOhler's
cyanic     acid, a result which, at that time, appeared           hardly credible.
These doubts, however, were set to rest by a              joint investigation on
the oxygenated acids of cyanogen,              which Liebig and Wohler pub
lished    in  1830.     In their      research   they proved, both analytically
and synthetically,       that cyanic and cyanuric        acid, although    distinct
bodies, have the same         elementary composition, and that the former,
when simply        kept in   a  sealed-up tube, gradually passes wliolly into
ii porcelain-like neutral        solid, cyamelide, which is widely different
from either.        By   these    discoveries, and by WOhler's        synthesis of
urea, the    fact of isomerism was firmly established.            Compared with
this great conquest their        joint work on mellitic acid (1830), and on
sulphovinic acid (1831), appears small ; it sinks into insignificance
when viewed in the light of their immortal researches on bitter
almond oil and on uric acid.
   In   1832 bitter-almond        oil  was supposed to be to bitter almonds
what a hundred and one other essential oils are to                 their vegetable
sources.      Of its chemistry nothing was known except the fact that
it contains loosely combined prussic acid, and that, when kept for a
long time,     it is liable to deposit     a crystalline solid, as various other
essential oils do.       Liebig and Wohler, being struck by the            absence
from even powdered            bitter    almonds of the intense smell charac
teristic of the oil, set about tracing the latter to its origin, and soon
 solved the question.        In   1830 Eobiquet and Boutron-Charlard           had
 succeeded     in extracting from bitter almonds a crystalline nitrogenous
 solid,  soluble withont decomposition in alcohol and in water, which
 they called amygdaline.            What Liebig and Wohler found, was that
  when bitter-almond meal          is mashed up with water, this amygdaline,
                                                                          d

                                                   50
 by the action of the water and                    a   ferment (common to both sweet
 and bitter almonds), breaks up into sugar, prussic acid, and bitter-
 almond       oil.      They also succeeded             in separating      the    prussic   acid
 from the distilled oil, and found the thus purified oil to be a non-
 poisonous        liquid of       the composition          C7iI0O.       This liquid, when
 exposed      to the air, readily takes            up oxygen and assumes the form
 of a solid which             is identical,      at the     same time,       with the quasi-
stearoptene           of the     oil   and     with     Scheele's    benzoic acid C7H00.>.
 When       treated       with     chlorine      the    purified     oil yields a chloride
 C;U-0     .  CI;     the chlorine of which, by treatment                with the respective
potassium compounds,                  is   displaced by its equivalent in bromine,
iodine, sulphur, cyanogen,                 and, on treatment with ammonia, by the
group      NIL      .    "Water      converts     it into hydrochloric           and benzoic
 acids.      In all      these    reactions the group C7H50 holds together, it
 moves forwards and backwards as if it were a compound element.
 A common-place enough fact in                    the eyes     of the   chemical     student of
 1882,    but      a    most    wonderful       revelation      to   the chemist of 1832.
 Borzolius, who certainly was not much                        given to dealing        in super
latives, greeted the discovery in his Jahrcsbericht                        as opening up a
new era in organic chemistry,                     and, rejecting the prosaic name            of
benzoyl which Wohler and Liebig had given to their radical, pro
posed     to    name       it proine or orthriue, from              irpau the beginning      of
the day, or orthriue, from                opC/jos   the dawn of the morning.
    It  is part of the glory of the two men that, in regard                        to none   of
their joint researches, the outer world ever had any hint given to it                        as
to what was the              one's   and what was the other's             share in the work
although         they rarely          worked      together in        the same       laboratory.
 Wohler would work away in Gottingen                             and Liebig in Giessen          ;
they only compared notes and slumped the whole into one memoir.
    Going by what we know of the genius of the two great men, we
should say that in the                   benzoyl      research     Liebig's    hand     is more
distinctly       visible,     while      the one       on   uric acid     (published      1837)
impresses         one     as   having       more      of  the    Wohler       element in it.
Uric acid         was     discovered by Scheele              in  177G.      It  is a constant
component of             urine, but more            readily    prepared from the excre
ment of birds and serpents.                      Its general properties and its rela
tions to       bases      are   all    that was       known      of   it when Liebig ami
Wohler        took it in hand.              Apart from an isolated observation of

a    crystalline       product,         which       he     called " erythric             acid," Wbhlcr
and Liebig, by, in            a     sense      following in Brugnatelli's                   footsteps, but
looking with sharper chemical eyes, discovered, instead of one,                                      a   wholo
host of derivatives, the disentanglement                           of which, oven to them, must
have been       a    tough problem.              But they did not rest                   before each and
every     one     of      the bodies           had       given       a    clear    account      of        itself.
Liebig,    somewhere               in his Chemical                   Letters,     spricht      ein       grosses
wort gelossen          uus,
                               " of any scientific investigation                          worthy of tho
name, the       main results can be summed up in                                  a   few words."               It
holds for his and             Wohler's        case.       Uric acid when oxidised behaves
as        were potential urea plus potential mesoxalic acid C303.(OH)2.
     if
     it
Part of the urea comes                        out as such          ;     the rest     unites     with          tho
mesoxalic       acid into          a    " ureide " with elimination                   of water, formed
from the two           (HO)'s of the acid and two of tho hydrogens in ono
molecule        of     the urea.    This     alloxan (Brugnatelli's
                                                         is         erythric
acid in    a  pure state). But alloxan itself, when further oxydised,
loses     part of its carbon as carbonic acid and becomes para-
bank, acid, the ureide of oxalic acid C^O^OF!^          Either ureide,
when treated with caustic alkali, takes up first one and then  second                                a
molecule of          water         to   form, in         the first          instance,       alloxanic        and
oxaluric    (hydro-parabanic)                 acid, in the second,                urea    plus mesoxalic
and oxalic acid respectively.                      Either ureide, when subjected to re
ducing agents,            takes up one           atom of hydrogen per molecule and                              is
reduced, the one to alloxantine,                         the other to oxalantine.                    A     more
limited oxidation             of uric acid leads to the formation                            of allantoine
 which, before Liebig and Wohler, had been known only as                                             a      com
 ponent of the         allantois-liquid of the                cow.       These few notes do not pre
 tend to do justice to the great research                      ;     but they will suffice to give to
 the general reader            a   notion of its importance.                      Liebig and Wohler's
 work — apart from             a   few isolated though not inglorious                          attempts —
 was not continued                  until Baeyer took                  it   up and rounded                it   off.
 Baeyer     has       enabled us to             see      clearly certain relations which had
 before been           obscure     ;    but    it   ia   worthy of notice that, while over
 hauling the whole of Liebig and "Wohler's work, he found nothing
 to rectify     ;    it   all proved solid masonry on which he was able to
    build without resetting              a    single stone.
      After their uric acid                  research         the ways of Wohler                and Liebig

                                        52
diverged.       The latter    continued    to prosecute         organic   research ;
the former turned his attention           more   to inorganic         subjects, not
exclusively      though,   as   the   well-known        research     on   narcotine
(which was carried out in his laboratory, part by himself, part by
 Blyth, and published in 1848) is alone sufficient to prove.
    As  a teacher  Wb'hler ranks with Liebig and Berzelius.              In  a sense
he was the greatest of the three.          Berzelius, we believe, never had
 the facilities afforded to him for teaching large numbers of students
 in his laboratory; and         as to  Liebig, even       he   lackeJ the many-
 sidedness which formed so characteristic         a feature in the Gottingen
 laboratory as long as it really was under Wohler's personal direction.
 One student might wish to work on organic chemistry, another on
 minerals, a third on metallurgy,      a fourth on     rare elements ; let     them
 nil go to Wohler and they all, like the fifth or sixth, would find
 themselves    in the right place.
    That Wohler in these circumstances should have been able to do
  much of literary work would appear incredible if we did not know
 it to he so. His Grundriss der Chemie, which he published anony
 mously at first, has passed      through    many editions         and been trans
 lated into various foreign languages ; never, we are sorry to say, into
  English.     A  more valuable teaching book       still, and      more  unique   in
 its character, is his excellent Praetische      Uebungen        in der  chemise/ten
  Analyse (entitled in the second edition Mineral- Analyse in Beispielen),
  which has been translated twice into English, once in this
  country    by    Hofmann, and       a   second     time      (from the second
  German edition) in America.         To a man like him the compilation
  of either book probably gave little trouble        ;   what must have taken
  up a very large portion      of his valuable time,       are  his translations of
  Berzelius's   Lehrbuch   der Chemie, and of all the many successive
  volumes of Berzelius's JahresbericJit,     which works only thus became
  really available to the scientific world at large.            We must not omit
  to state in this connection that since 1838 Wohler has been one of
  the editors of Liebig's Annalen.
     Wohler's last publication dates from 1880. It treats of a new
  kind of galvanic element in which the one metal aluminium serves
  far either pole.     We mention this as showing that he continued
  working to almost the     edge of his grave.

                                          53
        Sir John Eose          Cormack.        By Professor Maclagan.
     John Rose Cormack         was   bom on    1st  March 1815, on the classic
  banks of Gala Water, in the Manse of Stow, of which parish his
 father, the Rev.     John Cormack, D.D., was minister.                His mother
 belonged to the old northern clan of Rose, her brother, Sir John
 Rose   of Holm, being      a distinguished   Indian    officer.
    Cormack's     primary education, like that of           so many     Scotchmen
 who have risen to distinction,          was got    in the parish school       ; his
 secondary    education    at the High      School    of Edinburgh;         and h.s
 professional education at the University of Edinburgh, in which he
 became     a  student    of medicine.       During his whole           University
 career he was a hard-working         student, and took the degree of M.L).
 on 1st   August 1837, on which occasion he got               a  University gold
 medal   for his thesis on the subject of Death from the Entry of Air
 into the Veins.      On this subject subsequently, both in a surgical,
 obstetrical, and medico-legal aspect, he made some further observa
tions in the years 1838 and 1850, and he again made                 it the subject
of a thesis   when he took the       degree  of M.D. of Paris in 1870.
    This was not, however, his first attempt at authorship, for he had
the year before      his graduation gained the prize of the Harveian
Society of Edinburgh for an essay on Creasote, which he subse
quently published as a thin octavo.               It  is curious     to note the
affection   which Cormack retained for his first scientific love, for
 Creasote figures    not only in many of his prescriptions               in future
years, but we find      that creasote water (cresylic acid) was used by
him in his surgical experience during           the siege of Paris in 1871,
instead     of the closely allied      carbolic    acid   now    so   familiar to
everybody.
   Having taken his        degree   with gold medal honours in 1837, he
went to   Paris, where he followed out his professional studies, chiefly
under    Andral    as  regarded      medicine,   and Velpeau         as   regarded
surgery.     He then returned to Scotland, and determined to settle in
practice  in Edinburgh, and        became   a  Fellow of the Royal College
of Physicians     of Edinburgh 2nd February 1841.                 Practice came
scantily,  but Cormack could not be idle. He became a lecturer on
Medical    Jurisprudence in the Extra Academical               School, and then

                                        54
ho entered upon that         course of     medical journalism which          was   a
leading characteristic     of   a  great   part of his subsequent life.           In
 1842, under     the name of the         London     and     Edinburgh     Medical
Journal, he started that monthly Journal of Medicine, which, under
some    changes   of designation     and varieties of editorship, contiuues
to bo an important vehicle of scientific         and practical     medicine ; its
334th number being that for          April 1883.
    In  1842 he was appointed          physician   to the Fever       Hospital in
connection with the Koyal Infirmary, and in this capacity he had
a large experience of the remarkable epidemic of Relapsing                   Fever,
which in 1843 occurred in Edinburgh and other towns in Scotland.
 The labour which he bestowed on his hospital work, and the
 accurate details which he preserved of             his    cases, are   a  striking
 character of the hard-working        nature of the man.        His observations
 were given to the profession in the form of          a  book on this epidemic,
 which had, up to that          time,   not been      so   fully and accurately
 described, and he subsequently published            some    additional    remarks
 on the subject in the London Medical Gazette for              April 1849.
    Cormack's    journalistic     venture,   and    his    work   as   a    hospital
 physician, did not, however, bring him much in the way of practice,
 and accordingly he migrated to London, where he remained but a
 short while, settling in practice in its neighbourhood at Putney.
    In   the  English    metropolis      his journalistic     propensities     again
 manifested themselves.         Besides writing leaders and other unsigned
 articles in some of the London medical journals, he became                    editor
 of the Asxociidion      Medical Journal,       the organ of the Provincial
  Medical   Association.     But this    he gave up      in 1856.     The journal
 was much improved under his management,                 aud still exists as the
 British Medical Journal, the organ of that          large and influential      body
 the British Medical Association.
     Cormack    did not, however,      succeed  in practice at Putney.           His
 journalism brought him much notoriety               and some      ill-will, but it
  was perhaps itself adverse       to his success      as a practitioner,     and  it
  was necessary   for him to look to something which would add to the
  means   of maintaining   a  rising family.
     An elderly lady who resided at Tours                 in France     required    a
  British medical man to      be always   with her, and accordingly         he  went
 to France,    with  the  life aud language of which            he was     familiar.

                                         55
This, however, was      a source   of income which could not           be otherwise
than temporary, and in the course of time his patient died, and he
had once more to look        for  a  field of practice.        He went to Paris,
and to enable     him to practise there he took the            degree of    M.D. of
Paris in 1870, using for the thesis which he was bound to present
to the    Faculty the old subject of the Entrance of Air into the
Veins, with the addition of his further observations which have
been already mentioned.          The sun seemed at last to be shining on
his side of the hedge.       Sir Joseph Olitfo, then the leading English
physician in Paris, was old, and soon died, and Cormack                     got into
good practice     among the English, and to some extent among the
French community.          He   was    appointed      physician     to the British
Embassy, and all seemed          to be getting on prosperously with him.
But soon the Franco-German           war broke out, and with it came the
downfall of the Second Empire.            Paris was    besieged    by the Germans,
and after   this disaster  the Commune followed.              Cormack's prospects
of an  easy going practice were      thrown to the winds, and, like every
one  in Paris, he felt how hard are the uses of adversity.               But now it
was  in this dark hour of disaster that Cormack                  really came forth
in great form and showed what was in the man.                      Amid the silent
horrors   of a severe winter, and the loud-sounding             horrors of foreign
invasion and civil war, he showed that ho was a good man, by
bringing out of his professional            treasure things     new and old.       It
 was not   now the work of     a  civil practitioner, but that of         a military
 medical officer, that he had to undertake.               If anything    be needed
to prove the propriety       of every aspirant       to the medical       profession
being    ascertained, before he gets his          degree,    to be qualified,    not
only in one, but in all the practical              branches of his profession,
 Cormack's case would supply            it.    His whole work hitherto had
 been essentially that of a physician,         he now came out strongly as an
operating surgeon, bringing to the front the surgical lessons he had in
his youth received from Lister, Syme, and others in the surgical
wards   in the Edinburgh Infirmary, and           some     of his  cases were really
triumphant results of conservative surgery.             It was   in the Ambulance
 Anglwse,    established    near his        then   residence,     and    maintained
 entirely by   Sir Richard Wallace, that he did his surgical work, and
 the writer   of this notice saw one of his triumphs in the person of
 the Communist,      Alphonse    Brunet, whose arm he saved by resection

                                        5fi
of the shoulder joint after       it had been shattered by         a rifle  buUet
For his good and courageous work at this time he was rewarded both
by the British and French Governments, being knighted by our
Queen, and made       a  Chevalier of the Legion of Honour.
   Peace being at length restored, Cormack                returned   to his more
usual work of physician, but now just as the sun of prosperity ha'l
begun to shine upon him, and when he had received honours                         of
which any man might         bo proud, the end drew near.            He had never
fairly got over the effects of his exertions during the war. Although
still looking fairly well, and in his usual good temper and spirits, he
was a sufferer from bladder disease, and he died on 13th May 1882.
   This was not the only bereavemont which the Franco-German
and Commune wars brought             upon the Cormack family.             In  1842
Cormack     had married Miss Hine, the daughter of a merchant                     at
Trelawney, Jamaica.        She, too, was one of the victims of these times
of political trouble.       She never recovered from the effects             of the
privation and distress to which all Paris at that time had been more
or less subjected.       The inclemency        of a hard snowy        winter,   tho
bursting of shells and the rattle of tho fusillade, the crash of falling
houses,   the want of due supplies           of food,      and the necessity      of
waiting, sometimes for hours, in the queue of persons who had to
go, single file, to tho bakers' shops to get           their loaf of  bread,   were
not likely to leave      unshattered     the health of a lady born in tho
"West   Indies, and who had been the mother of eleven children, and
no one therefore need be surprised            to learn    that in three months
Lady Cormack followed her husband to the               grave.   She died on 19th
July   1882.
   Cormack     had had eleven children, and among his trials of                 life
was    the mortality     which occurred         among     them.    Two died in
childhood,   of scarlet fever and typhoid respectively.             One who was
grown    up died in Brazil, of phthisis         after yellow fever.       In  1876
death dealt heavy blows on Cormack.                  His daughter, Mrs Lyon,
died in India soon        after giving    birth to    a  boy, who was a great
solace to his grandfather      in his last  years  ;  and within   a week of this
event in India he lost in Paris his son Bailey Cormack, who was a
promising    young member of the            medical profession     — his father's
right hand man in his surgical work in the war time, and                     whoi»o
excellent   qualities   cannot be bettor recorded thau they arc in tho

following     preface to    Sir John's account of his patient Brunet, whose
case has already been alluded to           : —
     " For nearly a year I had not seen him
                                                        (Brunet) till we met on
the 29th April 1876, at the funeral of my dear son John Rose
Bailey Cormack.           Weeping bitterly      he grasped     my hand, and said,
'
   I  never liked any one so much as              Dr Bailey    : he did not know
what fear was, but he was to me and all the other wounded kind
as a brother and gentle as a woman.'              In justice to Brunet,     I cannot
refrain from here placing           on record his tender         appreciation     and
beautiful      tribute to my       late   son — my skilful assistant in most
trying    circumstances — one        who was the joy and hope of my life.
It   is pleasant to record that even men of             '
                                                          Communistic      type
                                                                                '
                                                                                   are
amenable       to kindness, and       can    love as well as hate their fellow-
men."
     Shortly after Bailey Cormack's death, his sister Margaret died of
pleurisy, induced,       it  was thought, by nursing her brother.
     Five of the family survive,          one    married    and   three unmarried
daughters, and a son, Charles Edward, who, following his father's
footsteps,    is now    a student of medicine.
     Cormack was       a  voluminous     writer, exclusive of what he did in
the way     of journalism.       In 1876, under the title of Clinical Studies,
he     republished      his   various   detached      writings in two volumes.
These embrace such             a variety     of subjects   besides those already
noticed, as       cholera, scarlatina,       granular  kidney,    several gyna?co-
logical matters, infantile convulsions, diphtheria, syphilis, concussion
of the brain, and certain forms of insanity.               It can by no means bo
said that    all  these are of equal      clinical importance, but all of them
manifest      good observing       power      and   determination     to study     the
subject fully.
     It  was a considerable        shock to many of Cormack's             friends to
learn     after   his death that he had left his family in straitened
circumstances.         It  is revealing no secret to mention        this, for it was
prominently        brought forward       by the British Medical          Journal in
 the very practical form of advocating              a memorial     subscription     for
 the benefit of Lady Cormack             and her family.         The way in which
 this was responded to, showed that Cormack                 had had many friends
  who esteemed him highly.            It did not surprise     those, however, who
  knew, nor      will it surprise any       one who hears the narrative        of his

                                          58
chequered life, as stated in this notice.         It is obvious that Cormack
never got into that steady Bort of practice which fills the puree.
His journalistic work was an impediment                rather than a help to
him.      It is not easy to      see   why he did not      succeed    in practice,
especially at Putney, where he had a good opening.                    It  was not
want of professional knowledge            ; his writings show that this was
full and extensive.        It was nothing wrong with his morale or his
relations with      religion,   for although     ho did      not   carry a broad
phylactery, or enlarge the border of his garments, ho was essentially
a quietly and unobtrusively          Christian man.     It   is neither pleasing
nor profitable to pursue this theme, and one can only fall back upon
the trite expression of the country of his adoption,             that he wanted
the " Je ni sain quoi," the absence of which has hindered the
success of many a man as full of erudition and observing power as
himself.
   Cormack       was a warm and steadfast friend,             and the writer of
these   lines desires to record that this was tho constant relation to
himself of tho subject of this obituary notice.
Snt   Charles Wyville Thomson, F.R.SS. L. and E.                         By Peter
                             Redferii, M.D. Lond.
   Charles     Wyville Thomson was born on tho 5th of March 1830 at
Bonsyde,     a  small property in Linlithgowshire, which had long been
in his family.        His father was the late Mr Andrew Thomson, who
spent most of his life abroad as a surgeon in the service of the
Honourable        East   India Company.        His mother was Sarah Ann
Drummoiul, tho only daughter of Dr Wyville Smith, Inspector of
Military Hospitals.        His grandfather was a distinguished Edinburgh
clorgyman,      and    his  great-grandfather    was   "Principall Clerke of
Chancellary" at the time of the Rebellion of 1745. His father was
rather a strict disciplinarian,       and expected to    see   successive distinc
tions at school and college following in the wake of the admirable
education which ho placed at the command of his son.
   These     were stirring     times    for  Scotland.      Unembarrassed      by
troubles from without,         her people were continually         struggling  for
intellectual   advancement.        They furnished     and maintained       schools

                                           59
of the highest       class in  the larger towns, and such as offered classical
training to       the   youth,   in the whole length and hreadth of the
country, in preparation for the Universities.                 In Edinburgh,      Glas
gow, Aberdeen,         and St Andrews,       she gave    university      education to
twice as large      a  proportion of her population as Prussia did           ; and it
is not to be wondered at that her sons have distinguished themselves
in every corner of the globe.             In   settling in the north of Ireland,
they introduced order and liberty, manufactures and prosperity, and
raised one of its towns at least to take its place amongst the most
enterprising and prosperous in the United Kingdom, whilst they
 themselves neither required soldiers nor police for the maintenance
of order and securing the advantages of the administration                     of just
 laws.      These   were the days of Thomson's youth.
     The mother's fond affection for her son led her to anticipate his
  wishes — to supply his wants — and to present him to his father as
 almost faultless in every relation           of his early life.        The son's   de
  votion    to his parents led him to make many an effort for their
  gratification, no less than for his own success in life.                  His early
  training was at Merchiston Castle School, when                   it was under the
  management of        Mr Charles Chalmers, brother of the famous divine.
  Mr Thomas Chalmers, of Longcroft, near Linlithgow, and son of
  the   then    proprietor of the school, stated at        a   meeting of the com
  missioners      of supply for the county of Linlithgow, that " when
  young      Thomson entered the school he himself had                    passed  from
   being a scholar to the position of         a master,   and thus became Thom
   son's  first teacher in   some   of those branches of        science   in which   he
   afterwards     became    so eminent."       Mr Chalmers adds — "          ~No doubt
   the lessons he received were of a very elementary description, still                I
   may be     allowed to recall with        some   satisfaction,    if not pride, the
   happy early days of our intercourse, when, with botanical boxes or
   geological hammers in hand, we rambled on Saturday holidays, or in
   the long summer evenings, among the woods of Braid and Colin -
   ton, or over the uplands of the beautiful Pentland                 Hills, in search
    of some of the interesting         flora or geological and mineral speci
    mens   in which the neighbourood of Edinburgh                so  richly abounds,"
    and then describes the exultation          and satisfaction with which         they
    returned with any new or rare specimen after            a  long day's excursion.
    Mr Chalmers      says that Thomson was a universal            favourite with his

                                              60
    schoolfellows,     and was highly esteemed by his teachers           for his con
    scientious discharge of every duty.
       Shortly after he had entered the University his desire to engage
   in original work began to show itself in his devotion to the study of
   botany and zoology.           It was his original intention to graduate in
  medicine, but the attractions of biological science were too great to
  permit of his devoting any large amount of attention                 to the other
  subjects of medical study, and at length                he gave up all idea       of
  qualifying      as a medical man or entering        into medical practice.       At
  this early period his desire to be free from the trammels of customary
  methods of study, and to trust to his own efforts, was well shown
  by the reply which Professor Balfour, then Professor of Botany, made
  to him on      his soliciting   a certificate  of attendance on his class— "       I
 will willingly testify to your knowledge of botany, but                    I  cannot
 certify that you attended my class."               This early formed spirit of
 self-reliance and determination            to investigate natural objects them
 selves, rather than trust merely to the results           of the observations of
 others, seems to have pervaded his life, and to have led to the
 urgent      requests he continually made for aid to establish collec
 tions     in   public institutions,     and at length to the appeal to the
 Government itself for the means               of carrying out what became        the
 most important work of his life, that of determining                 the physical
 and vital conditions which prevail at different depths of tho ocean.
     I  first met   Wyville Thomson at the house of my late dear friend,
 Professor     J.  H. Bennett, at the time of the meeting of the British
 Association in Edinburgh in 1850, when the friendship commenced
 which remained unbroken for           a single hour     during the whole of his
life.      I  was gTeatly    impressed with his knowledge         of botany, and
with     the energy and determination          in the pursuit of   science    of one
who appeared to me to have the most tempting                  professional career
open before him.
     Dr Dickie had been removed from the University and King's
College,      Aberdeen,     to the chair      of  Natural History in Queen's
College, Belfast.        Finding that Thomson had no disinclination to
devote himself, for some time at least, to scientific work,               I had  the
pleasure of        recommending      him for the vacant         lectureship,     and
seeing him start on the career which ended so brilliantly but pre
maturely.        In   1851    he  was prevailed     on to leave    King's and to

                                         Gl
lecture   in Marisehal College, Aberdeen, where he continued          to study
his favourite subjects and to teach botany until 1853, when he was
selected     by the Crown as the successor to the Eev. Wm. Hincks,
.F.L.S., in the chair of Natural History in Queen's College, Cork.
    The   charming      flora and   fauna of Aberdeen,       which had     been
laboriously worked        for years by    Dr Dickie, who had indicated the
spots where the most interesting specimens were to be met            with,  was
open and ready for further          examination     by the  more   daring and
speculative spirit of Thomson.          It  was not long before a visit to his
study possessed the greatest         attractions and charms.      Around the
room, on shelves, tables, and floor alike, there lay,         in what would
have seemed       to a casual observer the most grotesque confusion, the
treasures     of description and illustration of the most eminent natur
alists of the day and of former times.          The shelves and mantelpiece
were,   shortly, crowded with      selected   and neatly preserved specimens
of Polyzoa       and sertularian zoophytes taken in the neighbourhood,
picked off the fishermen's lines, or dredged up by Thomson him
self  ; here   and there lay heaps of plants already in their places in
the   herbarium, or in process of preparation for being preserved; and,
what was more charming than all, there were bowls and dishes and
aquaria of all kinds, containing          the actual living specimens which
 were   being examined, and of which the characters             were  rendered
permanent by the naturalist-artist           himself in the most beautifully
executed      drawings.     Amidst all    these  signs of true scientific work
there were indications of the enjoyment which the tenant of this
sanctum himself derived from indulging in his natural tastes.               The
specimens of the most elegant forms were always in the foreground               ;
 there never failed to be seen two or three rare or beautiful           flowers,
 made ten times more         beautiful than ordinary by the tasteful way in
 which     they were displayed, whilst the newest photographs or
 sketches of the glens or other scenery in the neighbourhood              found
 a  home on any unoccupied spots there chanced to be on the walls.
 Those who had the privilege            of witnessing    the progress of this
 happy     life,  of noticing   how the varying       forms of these     elegant
 aertularians gradually proclaimed         their mode of development, how
  their myriad medusoids were produced, at length set free, and then
  fettled in life, under the observation         of the loving   intruder into
  their inner life, could not but wonder how time was obtained for all

                                      02
this varied work, attended       as it was with the enjoyment          of the
pleasures of social life, and with that of adding          to those pleasures
the charms of wit, of elegance,     and manner of one who was equally
at home, and oven more happy, in the society of ladies and educated
men than in the company of his home family of zoophytes, or othiT
of the lower forms of living heings.
    Thus two or three of the earlier     years of the  public life of Wyville
Thomson were spent.         They produced many       papers of great interest,
which were published        in the Annals     of Natural History and other
periodicals, and gave birth to very noticeable philosophical          specula
tions on the development of certain medusoid forms, startling many
older naturalists,     and only partially accepted       by others, such as
Johnston of Berwick-upon-Tweed,            and Edward Forbes,        who con
sidered them too daring advances on what was then known                 of the
 modes of    life of those beings.
    On leaving Aberdeen, Thomson had secured a large number of
 sincere friends to whom his departure was a great loss.             His kind
 ness   of heart and his many estimable social qualities had         made   him
 desired in every circle, whilst in both          the colleges    to which ho
 had been attached he was looked upun as             a rising naturalist,   des
 tined to attain great eminence as years          advanced.    The degree     of
 LL.D. was conferred upon him by Marischal College, Aberdeen.
    Ill  Cork, to the duties of teaching botany, those of teaching
 zoology were added, and both were discharged with equal vigour
 and success.       But other   changes    were awaiting      him.    Early in
 1854    he married Jane, the elder daughter of Adam Dawson, Esq.,
 deputy lieutenant      of the county of Linlithgow, and proprietor of
 Bonnytown, the neighbouring          estate   to Bonsyde.     As tho friend
 of the bridegroom, I had the pleasure of participating in the great
 gathering of members of the county families, and of Thomson's
 numerous Edinburgh friends, to celebrate           what was deemed     a  most
 auspicious union of two families, both held in high estimation               by
 all who knew them.          In  tho same     year tho chair of Mineralogy
 and Geology       in Queen's College, Belfast, became vacant by the
  resignation of Professor Frederick M'Coy, who was elected to a
  professorship in the new University of Melbourne, and Thomson
  was then transferred from Cork to Belfast.
     Tho    studies   incident   on   the    occupation    of    the  chair   of

                                        G3
Mineralogy and Geology and the charge of the Natural History
Museum, following in succession on the study of Botany and
Zoology,    the subjects    of Thomson's former chairs, now completed
his training    as a Professor of Natural History.          He devoted much
time and attention to Palaeontology, and thus, in comparing tho
old world forms with those at present existing, obtained much
useful insight into the relations between them.            Under his guidance
the Museum of the College           was  greatly enlarged, especially in the
departments      of Zoology and Palaeontology, and his efforts in this
respect received the hearty co-operation of the president and vice-
president.      Specimens for teaching and for the enrichment               of tho
 museum were sought for everywhere, and properly                  arranged      and
classified.     Whatever new objects       possessed   unusual interest were
 made the subjects of papers read before scientific societies, or pub
 lished in the journals of the day.        It  was at this time that      a  paper
 appeared on a genus of Trilobites         ;  this had  been    read before tho
 London Geological       Society.     Another, on    a   fossil   Cirriped, was
 published     in the Annals       of Natural      History.      Ono    can    well
 imagine the growing       consciousness of power in dealing with fossil
 forms which Thomson's          previous knowledge of tho existing           living
 forms gave him, and that, as the accumulation              of specimens pro
  ceeded, the series would be seen to be in certain parts more or less
  complete, whilst   in others it would be found wanting, and thus tho
 necessity    of further investigation     would be pointed        out.     It  was
 natural that, when he       came    to the collection   and investigation        of
 the  "numerous    varieties of    extinct   forms of echinodernis,       the eye
 which was always open to the charms of beauty should have been
 arrested, and that it should have occurred to him that what was
 needed for a complete understanding           of them was     a  correct know
 ledge of everything       which their living forms could         teach.      From
 this time he returned to his study of the development of the larval
 forms of these low organisms, especially with reference to Comatula
 and Pentacrinus,      no doubt      with the hope of arriving at some
 general conclusions      as  to the relations of their peculiar mode of
  development with that of the higher animals, and of showing their
  connection with extinct forms.
     Mr J. V. Thomson had found his Pentacrinus Eurqpteus in tho
  Bay of Cork in 1823, and was thus the first to discover a recent

                                            CA
encrinito    in the     seas  of Europe,     as  he was   the first who ever had
the opportunity        of examining one in its living        state.     As the result
lie declared it to be the young of Comatula, and, comparing his
youngest Comatula           with the oldest Pentacrinus          he could find, he
demonstrated this relation to the satisfaction               of Professor Edward
Forbes,    Dr Ball of Dublin, and the late William Thompson of
Belfast.     Yet much remained to be done to clear up the whole
history   of this single form, and this occupied "Wyville Thomson
for several years.           A sketch of his " On the Embryogeny of
Comatula       rosacea"      appeared in       the   Proceedings     of   the  Royal
tiociety for 1858,       a paper   "On the Embryology of Asteracanthion
riolaceus"      was     published in the Microscopical           Society's Journal
for   1861-62,       and his paper " On            the   Pentacrinoid      Stages  of
Comatula"       was    sent to the Royal Society in December 1862, read
in February 1863, and published in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1865.      This paper is a model of care and accuracy, illustrated
by many beautiful           and   highly artistic      drawings      of  the various
stages,   executed by the author,             and itself attests his       powers  of
research and     his accuracy of discrimination         and delineation.      Whilst
engaged     in this work,        Thomson       accumulated     a  largo amount     of
material, with       a  view to give an account of the whole genus Penta
crinus at some future time.             Indeed, as far as these researches        on
development are concerned,           it   is almost to be regretted that they
so soon led to the great           work of      deep   sea research,    which, when
once entered upon, took up so large an amount                 of time.
    In  a correspondence        with Michael Sars, tho celebrated Professor
of Zoology       in the University of Christiania, Wyville Thomson
learned    that     tho professor's son,        M. Oscar Sars, whilst engaged,
as one    of    the    acting Commissioners of Fisheries, in a series of
investigations as to the fisheries off the Loffoten Islands, north-west
of the   coast of      Norway, had dredged up from about 300 fathoms a
number of living animal forms.                In  response   to an invitation from
Professor     Sars, Thomson visited Norway to examine these objects,
and he states that amongst them there was                  a small crinoid of sur
passing interest, which they at once recognised as                 a  degraded type
of   the Apiocrinidse,        an  order which had up to that time               bwn
regarded as entirely extinct.          Some years previously M. Absjornsen,
dredging     in 200 fathoms in          the   Hardangerfjord,      procured several

                                       r,r,
examples of      a  starfish "Brisinga," which seems to find its nearest
ally in the fossil genus Protaster.            In this way it had         become
certain   that animal life does not cease in the ocean at          a  depth of   a
few hundred        fathoms,    as the late   Edward Forbes had supposed.
"Wyville Thomson tells         us that, long previously      to  1868, he '"had
a profound      conviction that the land of promise for the naturalist,
the only remaining         region where there were         endless novelties of
extraordinary      interest ready to the hand which had the means               of
gathering    them, was the bottom of the deep sea."               And when, in
his visit to Norway,        he became     fully acquainted with      the advant
ages which Professor          Sars and his son had enjoyed through            the
means of their Government, he resolved to lose no opportunity                   of
pointing out how greatly the Government                 of the most powerful
maritime nation in the world might aid science by placing at the
disposal of naturalists one of their numerous unemployed vessels to
assist in the exploration of the ocean depths.             A favourable oppor
tunity presented itself when         engaged    with Dr W. B. Carpenter in
•working out the structure and development of the Crinoids in the
spring   of   1868.     Dr Carpenter    was a    vice-president    of the Royal
 Society, through which body alone it seemed that the Government
could be influenced.         He considered the subject carefully, and hav
ing arrived at     a  conclusion favourable to the project, it was resolved
that he should bring the subject under the notice of the Society,
introducing it by a letter which his colleague was to write to him
after his return to London.           The Royal Society and the Govern
ment    entered heartily into the plan, and the dredging cruises of
 H.M.S. "Lightning" and " Porcupine" and                the   expedition   of the
" Challenger"      were the result
   It  has been already stated      that Wyville Thomson was appointed
to the chair of Mineralogy        and Geology in Queen's College, Belfast,
in 1854.       On the removal of      Dr Dickie     to Aberdeen     in 1860, the
duties   of the chair ofBota ny and Zoology           were    also entrusted   to
him, and    he became from that time Professor           of Natural History in
these four branches.         For the discharge of these duties he was very
peculiarly fitted from the happy way in which he had at different
times been called upon to teach the four subjects in succession.
He had now the entire responsibility of the department of Natural
 History.     In the year 1860 he was admitted to the degree of            LL1   >.

                                        6G
in the Queen's University ad eurulem.          As a resident in Belfast he
entered heartily into every plan for the spread of knowledge or the
improvement       of his townsmen.        He was an active member of the
Natural History and Philosophical Society, and at its meetings he
contributed many valuable papers.           As  a lecturer he was fluent in
style, easy in manner, and lucid in thought            and expression.       He
conveyed to his hearers much of the interest he had in his subject,
and encouraged them to engage in original work.                He was instru
mental in placing the School of Science and          Art in its present rela
tion to South Kensington,         and took a constant and lively interest
in its success.
   He was an active member of the local committee in connection
with the meeting of the Social Science Congress in Belfast, under
the presidency of the Earl of Dufferin,       in 1867.
   Interested in education, and attached to the system on which the
Queen's Colleges and Queen's University were founded, he strenu
ously opposed all attempts to interfere with their academic character
or their privileges.      When   a supplemental charter was issued,       which
it was believed would        lessen  the necessity for thorough academic
training to obtain        degrees   in the Queen's University, Wyville
Thomson      came    forward    very prominently,   and succeeded        in col
lecting large funds, and obtaining still further        guarantees from an
influential committee, which enabled the validity of the charter to
be tested    in the Court of Queen's Bench.           The result was that,
after long and protracted arguments, an injunction was granted in
 1867   by the Master of the Rolls which rendered the supplemental
charter inoperative,      and helped     to prevent    for   many years the
substitution     of a system of       mere   examinations      for   the   most
complete academic training which prevailed in any university.
   Regardless of the differences of religious        and political     opinion
which prevailed in Belfast, he was courteous to all, tolerant                 of
every opinion       frankly formed, and never obtrusive of his own.
He   was esteemed       by all classes and parties, he had friends every
where, and his house was always             open to all of distinction        in
science   or art who might        happen to visit Belfast.       Engrossed    in
his own proper studies, he never obtruded them upon others, but
whenever      assistance   or   advice   in connection     with    them    were
needed,    he   spared   no pains    to  make both     effective.    His tact,

                                             67
  consideration,    and good taste never failed            him.    His passion for
  flowers   seemed a part of      his nature    ; he   cultivated them with tho
  greatest    care,  and, though       delighting      to   display   them     to  tho
  greatest    advantage in      his   own     house,    he    enjoyed    equally    his
  regular   practice of carrying       any particularly choice specimen he
  might have grown to present it to some of his many friends.
     In   1867    he   was made       Vice-President of the Jury on Raw
  Products at the Paris Exhibition.
     On the 30th May 1868 he addressed                tho letter to   Dr Carpenter
 which     was     previously    agreed     upon,    pointing    out   that    Edward
  Forbes's    conclusion, that     a  zero of animal life was reached at a
  depth of a few hundred fathoms, was incorrect, as had been proved
  by AL    Absjbrnsen's      dredging     starfishes at 200 fathoms, and by
 M. Oscar Sara dredging living cricoids from 300 fathoms ; that tho
 effect of pressure has probably been greatly exaggerated,                 because an
 equal pressure     within and without by water would probably produce
 no   injurious effect on animal           life, and might      even   contribute    to
 increase    the aeration    of the water ; and that, looking             at the con
 dition of the       cave   fauna,   it is probable that the diminution of
 light at great depths may only affect the development of colour and
of the organs of sight.         He   suggested    that, whilst dredging at 1000
fathoms     was quite beyond         the reach of private enterprise,           it was
quite   practicable     if the Admiralty could           be induced     to grant tho
use    of  a    vessel   for the purpose.         He proposed to start from
Aberdeen,        to go first to the Eockall fishing banks, and thence
north-westward        towards the coast of Greenland, rather to the north
of Cape Farewell
     Dr Carpenter        wrote    to    General     Sabine     enclosing     Professor
"Wyville      Thomson's      letter,  pointing     out     the   admirable      results
obtained       by M. Sars, with similar aid granted by                  the   Swedish
Government ; and showing that he and                  Dr Thomson had restricted
their request within such conditions as could, without great expense
or inconvenience,        be acceded    to by the Admiralty.         On the evening
of the day on which Dr Carpenter's letter was written, General
Sabine brought the subject under the consideration of the council
of the Royal Society, who at once approved of the proposal, recom
mended      it to the favourable consideration of the authorities of tho
 Admiralty, and advanced           a  sum of £100 to meet expenses.                Tho

Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty wrote on the 14th                     July that
they had given orders for Her Majesty's             steam vessel     " Lightning "
to be prepared immediately at Pembroke to meet the wishes of the
Poyal    Society.     The     " Lightning    "
                                                 left Pembroke         on the       4th
August    1868.      Drs Carpenter       and Thomson, and          Dr Carpenter's
son Herbert, joined the vessel at Oban, whence they sailed on the
8th August.        They reached Stornoway          on the 9th, and left          it for
the north on the 11th.         On the     same  afternoon they dredged in 60
to 100 fathoms      ; on the 13th in 450 fathoms, finding no bottom,
hut the high temperature of            9 -5° C;    afterwards     in 600 to 700
fathoms in the same locality.          Bad weather frequently impeded the
dredging    operations.      On the return of the       vessel   to Stornoway        on
the 9th September,      Dr Wyville Thomson was obliged to leave her
to attend to duties in Dublin, but Dr Carpenter remained with the
vessel, left Stornoway again on the 14th September and dredged in
650 fathoms, but on the 21st the weather was so bad that the work
had    to be    concluded.      There    were only ten days available               for
dredging in the whole six weeks, and on only four of these was the
vessel in water over         500 fathoms       deep.     Yet   a  fair  measure      of
success had been achieved.
   It  was shown that varied and abundant              animal life, represented
by all the invertebrate groups, occurs at depths in the             ocean down to
650 fathoms at least      ; and that, instead of deep sea water having an
invariable   temperature of 4°      C,   great masses of water, at tempera
tures varying from     2°   C. to 6-5°  C, maintain     a remarkable system          of
oceanic circulation,    and yet keep so distinct from each other that
both may be found within the limit of an hour's sail.                   It  was also
ascertained that a large proportion            of the forms living at great
depths of the sea are      of unknown species, and identical with tertiary
fossils previously believed to be extinct.
   The next year, 1869, saw        Wyville Thomson again           engaged      in the
examination      of the physical, chemical, and biological conditions of
the ocean     depths, for the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty
had acceded      to the additional      request of the council of the Royal
Society and had set     apart the
                                     " Porcupine,"     a small vessel       fitted up
for surveying     purposes and admirably adapted for the continuance
of  these  researches,   from the beginning         of May to the middle             of
September.       As it    was   impossible    for those    connected with the

                                        09
previous expeditions to be absent from their public               duties for any
large portion of this time,        it was resolved that there should             be
three separate cruises, one on the west coast of Ireland, the Porcu
pine Bank, and the channel            between       Rockall and the       coast  of
Scotland,    under the scientific    charge   of Mr Gwyn Jeffries, F.R.8.          ;
a second to the north        of Rockall, leading northwards to the point
where     the expedition     of  18C8    left  off,  under the charge       of Dr
Thomson     ;  and the third to work over the           "  Lightning Channel
                                                                                   "
and check the        former   observations, under        the direction      of l>r
Carpenter.
    Mr Gwyn Jeffries      was   favoured with remarkably           fine weather,
and found it possible to dredge during seven days at depths greater
than 1200 fathoms, and on four days at less depths. His deepest
dredging was 1476 fathoms, and the whole of them yielded an
abundance      of novel and interesting results in every invertebrate
sub-kingdom.
    Captain Calver was     accustomed      to minute accuracy in surveyiug,
and thoroughly versed in the          use   of instruments and in the bear-
ings of scientific investigation.       His crew were chiefly known and
tried men, Shetlanders who had spent many successive summers in
the "Porcupine" under his command.                Aided by    a staff  of  zealous
officers, Captain Calver soon obtained so entire            a  mastery over the
operation     of dredging that he made it almost          a certainty at depths
at which this kind of exploration             would     have been previously
deemed out of the question.          Wyville Thomson at          once recognised
these favourable     conditions, and having found that the experiences
of the previous    year, and   all their anticipations for the present, had
been realised, at least for the depth of nearly 1500 fathoms, and
that even    at that depth nearly      all the types of living marine inver-
tebrata were represented, though the number of species seemed
reduced and the size of the animals dwarfed, he suggested                   that  it
would be desirable that the second cruise should             be made    in  deeper
water   than    had originally been intended,          and     poiuted    out   the
position of the deepest water easily accessible, 250 miles west of
Ushant, as a fitting place for the next observations.
    The Hydrographer       cordially acquiesced in this proposed           change
 of plan, and it was arranged that the next dredging should be done
 at this spot, in water 2500 fathoms deep.                   Professor Wyville

                                        70
                             in the " Porcupine
                                                        "
Thomson      left Belfast                                  to take the scientific
direction    of this cruise on the 17th July 1869, taking with him
 Mr Hunter, F.C.S., chemical assistant in Queen's College, Belfast,
to examine and analyse the samples of sea water.                    At Queenstown
Mr P. Herbert Carpenter joined the ship to practise the gas
analysis which he was to undertake on the third cruise.
   The    vessel  proceeded    on her voyage at 7          p.m.   on the 19th   July,
steaming in a south-westerly           direction      across    the   mouth    of the
channel.      At   4.30 A.M.    on the 21st they were still only on the
plateau of the channel in 95 fathoms of water, but from midday to
the afternoon they passed over the edge of the plateau and dredged
in 725 fathoms, the bathymetrical              horizon of vitreous 6ponges          in
the northern seas, bringing up several specimens of these beautiful
forms, and a slight admixture of globigerina ooze in sand.                    On the
22nd they were in water of about the greatest depth they had reason
to expect, 2435 fathoms, at        a temperature of 2-5° C.              A successful
dredging yielded \h cwt of grey chalk mud, containing examples of
each   of the invertebrate      sub-kingdoms,        which,      though dead,     had
evidently     been   alive   when    they     entered      the    dredge.     Similar
result* attended a dredging        on the 23rd at the same               depth, after
which the party returned to the             coast    of   Ireland,     dredging   and
noting    the results at intervals        on   the way.        The    vessel  reached
Cork on the 2nd August, and Belfast on the 4tli.
   She left again on the third cruise for the year, on the 11th
August,     under    the   direction   of   Dr Carpenter, Mr P. H. Car
penter undertaking       the analyses, and Wyville Thomson accompany
ing them.       He busied himself in drawing, naming, and describing
new    species,   and in     noting    the    great    general     features of     the
prevailing    physical and vital conditions.           It is scarcely possible for
anyone, however little imaginative, to read the graphic accounts of
the   incidents    of these    voyages without           having     his   enthusiasm
aroused,   and almost wishing to have been              present on many        of the-
occasions so forcibly depicted.          It  seems more       like   a dream than a
reality   that at a single haul the dredge should have brought                      up
in its   bag and     on its    tangles    not    less   thau     20,000    specimens
of the pretty little urchin, Echinus             norvegicus,      and we have      Dr
Thomson's       authority   for such      an   event having         happened.      On
other    occasions, one is irresistibly        brought to watch, with haled

 collected.      His account of the glimpses from time to time                        as the
 dredge was coming in, of what seemed to be a large scarlet urchin,
 the disappearance of         it now and then          as  if  lost altogether, then its
 quiet settling down as a round red cake, and beginning to pant, —
that he had to Biimmon up some resolution before taking the weird
little monster in his hand, —show the graphic power of the author
no less than the enthusiasm of the naturalist.
    I cannot     forbear giving another illuatration             : —"     I  do not believo
human dredger ever got such a haul.                      The special inhabitants           of
that    particular region — vitTeous             sponges      and echinodorms — had
taken quite kindly to the tangles, warping themselves into them,
and    sticking through them and over them, till the                         mass was such
that we could scarcely get it on board.                  Dozens of great Holtenite,

                               "With silver beard and hair         ;
a dozen      of the best of them breaking off just at that critical point
where     everything doubles its weight by being lifted out of the
water,    and sinking slowly away back again to our inexpressible
anguish ; glossy whisps of Hyalonema                    spicules ; a bushel         of the
pretty    little mushroom-like Tisiphonia             ; a  fiery constellation       of the
scarlet Agtrvpecten        tenwispinm     ; while       a wholo         tangle was ensan

guined by      the '  disjecta membra          of  a splendid Brisinga."
   The effect of the brilliant phosphorescence of the contents of the
dredge are      vividly pourtrayed      ;  and the argument in favour of the
urchins,     which     are   only one-fourth of the              size     of others whose
characters are indistinguishable              from theirs, being dwarfed speci
mens     of the    same    genus, is not easily forgotten              : — " The  Shetland
variety of Eqmts eaballus is certainly not more than one-fourth                          the
size   of an ordinary London dray-horse, and                      I    do not know that
there is any good reason why there should not bo                            a pony form of
an urchin as       well as  of  a horse."
    "Wyville Thomson had arranged with his colleagues to take part
in   an exploration      of the   deep sea to the south               of Europe and the
Mediterranean in 1870, but he was prevented from doing so by an
 attack of fever.       "let he   gave at second hand a              brief account   ot the

                                                                   exceptional con
ditions of temperature                 and animal life observed by Dr Carpenter in
the Mediterranean as compared                           with the outer ocean.
   In    the        whole life of Thomson,                     notwithstanding              his vivid       ap
preciation          and    accurate       descriptions of the most minute details of
structure necessary                  for the determination of new species, and for
allotting          them    their proper position in nature,                          he   never allowed
himself to be dragged down to the level of                                  a mere    collector, accumu
lating    myriads of individual objects                              and    cataloguing them.               He
invariably          rose       superior         to    details,       and,    subordinating             them as
merely      means for arriving at                just conclusions regarding the physical
and vital characters                 of the     earth and its living freight in long past
ages    or the present time, he devoted                          his best thoughts to the con
sideration of the means by which great results might be achieved.
The idea that either individual or even imperial aid was necessary
neither occasioned               him anxiety nor discouraged him                            ;   he resolutely
set forth the conditions,                       showed how important results could be
arrived at, and the means never failed him.
   His discussion of                 the effects of the          Gulf       .Stream on the climate              of
the coasts of Northern                  Europe, in comparison with the influence of
any possible          general         ocean circulation,              is a good illustration of his
wide and powerful grasp of natural phenomena                                      bearing on any par
ticular point.             He had measured                 in the North Atlantic the extent
of the      warm          and cold areas of water,                      and recognised            the    fauna
which     are       proper to each          ;   he had determined the existence                         of the
vast layer of cold water, 1500 fathoms thick, at the bottom of the
Bay of Biscay, and that the temperature there at 1230 fathoms from
the surface          is the same as that of the bottom off Rockall                                 ;    he saw
that, whilst the communication of the North Atlantic and the Arctic
Sea is restricted,             the    communication with the Antarctic basin                              is,   as
                           "
he describes         it        open     as the        day," —    a   continuous and wide valley,
upwards of 2000 fathoms in depth, stretching northwards along the
western      coasts of          Africa          and    Europe;        and then pointed out how
much      less startling             than       it   appears     at first sight        is   the suggestion
that the cold water                  filling    deep ocean valleys in the northern hemi
sphere may be partly derived from the southern.                                        He calls to mind

                                        73
 that the floor of the Atlantic is covered by a creamy,                  flocculent
 layer of microscopic animals      ;  whilst, wherever there is any known
current, this deposit is absent and replaced by gravel, and thus shows
that the movement of any cold indraught                 of water at the bottom
must be excessively slow.         He dispels the chimerical idea that there
is  a kind of equatorial diaphragm between the northern and southern
ocean basins,     and explains    that it is only on the surface of the sea
that a line is drawn between the two hemispheres by the equatorial
current      He then gives    as evidence      of the slow indraught of cold
water from the Southern Sea, that          it is colder than the mean winter
temperature of the area which it occupies and that of the crust of
the earth,   and that its temperature rises as it is traced northward               ;
whilst,    owing to Behring's       Straits being only 40 fathoms deep,
there is no adequate northern source          of such    a body of cold water.
    In 1869 "Wyville Thomson was             elected    a  Fellow of the Royal
Society;     and in the year following, on the resignation of Dr
Allman, he was appointed Professor of Natural History in the                   Uni
versity of Edinburgh.        His friends in Belfast recognised the dis
tinction    which had thus       been   conferred      upon him, but felt the
loss   which the college and the town had sustained by his re
moval, and, on taking leave of him, presented him with a handsome
service   of plate and an illuminated address at           a public meeting pre
sided    over by the mayor.          The    honorary      degree   of D.Sc.     was
conferred upon him by the Queen's University about the same time.
    His duties now     became   more    arduous than ever.         His class-room
was crowded      with students, whom he taught not merely by lectures
but by practical       demonstrations.       In   1871, the meeting of the
British    Association   in Edinburgh, the arrangement and plans of
the    new University      buildings,    troubles     in connection      with the
admission of females to the college classes, and the transfer of the
 Museum of which he was Regius Keeper, to the Museum of Science
and   Art, added greatly to his      necessary   labours.
    At this time the rapid extension of          ocean    telegraphy gave prac
 tical value to everything     which concerned the depth of the              ocean,
 the character   of its bottom, and the presence there of animals which
 might injure the coverings of telegraphic cables,           whilst great interest
 was being manifested by the public         in the remarkably novel experi
  ences  of the cruises of the       " Lightning
                                                    "
                                                        and the " Porcupine."

                                           74
From America and from Europe                more   or less effective expeditions
had been sent out, but it was evident             that it rested very specially
with England to lay down the first broad outlines of the physical
and biological conditions of the bottom of the ocean.
    The circumstances were very propitious            ;  and when     Dr Carpenter
addressed    a  letter to the First Lord of the Admiralty, urging the
despatch of a circumnavigating              expedition    for this purpose, their
lordships,    after  a   favourable     report   of the Hydrographer          to  the
Navy,    agreed to despatch such an expedition,              if the Royal Society
recommended it and furnished them with a feasible scheme.
    Mr Lowe, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, with                   great interest
and sagacity, saw that such an enterprise was entirely beyond the
reach of private means, and agreed to furnish the necessary funds.
The " Challenger " was chosen for the purpose, with Captain Nrres,
a  surveying officer of great experience and skill, to command her,
an  1 Professor Wyville Thomson as director of the Civilian Scientific
Staff.    He tells   us that    " when the suggestion was made to him at
the commencement of the negotiations to join the expedition, the
sacrifice appeared     in every way      too great ; but as the various arrange
ments progressed,       so many    friendly plans were proposed on all hands
to smooth away every difficulty,              that he finally accepted        a post
which,    to a younger naturalist, without the ties of a family and a
responsible home, would          be perhaps among the most            delightful the
world could offer."
    The President and Council of the Royal Society nominated the
 members of the Civilian Scientific             Staff, and     a Circumnavigating
 Committee,     amongst      whom      were   Dr Carpenter and Dr "Wyville
 Thomson,     suggested     a  scheme      whereby    it   was   believed the best
 results   might be obtained.           Sixteen of the eighteen large guns
              "               "
 which the Challenger            carried were removed ; she was fitted with
a natural    history workroom,         a   chemical laboratory, and furnished
 with every scientific appliance to the satisfaction of the director,
 and in   a way entirely unprecedented for scientific             purposes.     With
b ship thus equipped, and the responsibility                of directing the most
 delicate and difficult scientific         observations at sea for      a  period  of
'three or four years,     Dr Wyville Thomson left Portsmouth                 on the
 21st December 1872 with the good wishes and ardently expressed
 hopes of every lover of science in Great Britain.

                                        75
     The first part of the voyage, that to the Canary Islands, was mado
 ¦merely  tentative, with    a view of getting everything     on hoard into
 perfect order for correct observations, and dividing the labour of
 research   in the most convenient way amongst the members of the
staff.
    On the 14th February 1873 the "Challenger" sailed from Santa
Cruz to cross the Atlantic, and the real work of the expedition
commenced.         She reached     Sombrero on the 15th March, the Ber
mudas on      the 4th April, and Halifax on the 9th of May.            Leaving
Halifax again on the 15th,          she went southwards    and back to the
Bermudas, to make another section of the Gulf Stream.                 On both
occasions    the most detailed and interesting observations were made.
Subsequently       she crossed   the Atlantic three times, visited Australia,
New Zealand, the Malay Archipelago, Hong Kong, and Valparaiso,
sailing altogether 68,930 miles, and returning to Sheerness on the
24th May 1876, after an absence of three years and           a  half.
   Shortly after his return, Dr C. Wyville Thomson               received the
honour    of knighthood,        and was appointed      by the    Lords Com
                                                                 '
missioners of Her Majesty's Treasury "Director of the              Challenger'
Expedition      Commission."        In the same year he was         awarded a
Boyal    Medal by the Royal Society for his successful direction of
the   scientific investigations carried    on by H.M.S. "Challenger."
    In July he and the other members of the scientific staff of the
" Challenger" were entertained at a banquet in Edinburgh. On
going with Emeritus Professor Balfour to Upsala, as the repre
sentative     of the Senatus of the University of Edinburgh on the
occasion of the tercentenary of that ancient University, the               King
of Sweden       created  him   a  Knight of the Order of the Polar Star.
He was    a   Fellow of the Royal Societies of London and Edinburgh,
a  Fellow of the Royal Irish Academy, Ph.D. Jena, Fellow of the
Linnean, Geological,        Zoological,  and Palseontological      Societies  of
London, and of various foreign and colonial institutes.               In   1877
he was appointed        to deliver the Rede Lecture      at Cambridge, and
in 1878    he presided over the Geographical         Section of the British
Association     at its meeting     in Dublin, and  was  made    LL.D. of the
 University of Dublin.
    Sir Charles discharged the duties of his chair with his customary
 vigour on his return from the voyage of the " Challenger," and

                                              7G
worked laboriously         at the vast amount of material and observations
which had been accumulated.                   In   1877 he published            two volume*
of a preliminary         account of the results of the voyage,                     a   work of
surpassing interest, not alone from the scientific value of the obser
vations recorded in            it,   and the conclusions which the author draws
from them, but for the beautifully executed illustrations                        it    contains,
and the graphic sketches which occur here and there of the general
as   well   as the scientific features        of the places visited and examined.
In    this work     Sir Charles has recognised the valuable assistance of
his colleagues       in the scientific staff; the aid which all the naval
officers,    without    exception, gave in the most friendly spirit to the
civilian staff; the wonderful temper with which the commander
and first lieutenant           tolerated all the irregularities           inseparable from
dredging      and      other     scientific   work ;    the    friendly readiness with
which       the chief    of the naval scientific              staff placed his valuable
observations at the disposal of the civilian staff; the patience and
care displayed         by the lieutenants who superintended the dredging
and trawling and the estimations of temperature                       ;   and his debt         of
gratitude to the sailors for the respect and consideration with which
they treated all the civilians on board.
     These were,       no doubt, remarkable result* — this combination                          of
everyone on board to achieve success,                     this subordination             of the
discipline,    cleanliness, and order of           a   man-of-war to the prosecution
of the study of Natural Science in various departments;                                  and    it
cannot be doubted that they were mainly                         due to the genial dis
position,     the many           engaging     social     qualities,       the    gentlemanly
bearing, and the untiring energy of Sir Charles Wyville Thomson.
  He admitted that the strain, both mental and physical, was long
and severe, and that   had told upon all of them.
                                 it                   His friends
observed that, with the continuance                    of the labours           necessary      for
                                                          " Chal
bringing out the full account of the whole results of the
lenger" Expedition, his vigour by no means kept pace, but until
1 879 there was no real cause for anxiety. In June of that year,
however, he had           a     serious illness, from which he only partially
recovered.       His place in the University of Edinburgh had to be
supplied,      and at length           arrangements were made for securing to
him    a    well-deserved        retiring allowance.           From time to time               he
persevered      in endeavouring to forward the publication                       of the com

                                                 77
plete reports of the Expedition, and still attended meetings of the
Commissioners             of Supply for his native county.              He even      sat as
magistrate sixteen days before his fatal illness.                     But from his first
seizure       he was unable to discharge the duties of his chair, and
retired from them altogether             in the October of 1881. Subsequently
he had also          to relinquish      his position as " Director of the ' Chal
lenger' Expedition Commission."                       In the beginning of March       1882
his critical condition was manifested                        by his making     a   personal
application to be relieved from attending at the Fiars' Court on the
10th of that month, the very day on which his last seizure proved
fatal.       He died at the early          age    of fifty-two,     having made many
lasting contributions to science,                secured large numbers of sincere
admirers and friends,             and received the applause and approval of
scientific         men       everywhere    for    the wisdom,       energy, skill,     and
courtesy       which he had shown in the direction of the most extended
and successful of scientific expeditions.
     Lady Wyville Thomson survives her husband.                         He left an only
child — Mr Frank Thomson, M.A. Ed.,                      a   student of medicine.
     The Commissioners            of Supply of the county of Linlithgow, with
a    committee         of scientific and other friends in Edinburgh,                  have
collected          several    hundred     pounds for the purpose of erecting a
lasting memorial to commemorate the distinguished                          services of the
late       Sir Charles Wyville Thomson, and it has been resolved to
place a       bust by Hutchison in the University of Edinburgh, and                       a
memorial -window in the beautiful                     collegiate church     in his native
place.

                                   Rumble.
   Mb Thomas William Rumble was born in London, 26th Decem
 ber 1832.     He received part of his education               at the Reading
Grammar School, under the celebrated           Dr Valpy.        At an early age
he was transferred     to the office of his father, an architect in good
practice, where he was taught the rudiments of his future profession.
Tiring of the dull routine of the drawing-office, he left home to try
his fortune  across the   Atlantic, where, after many adventures,          he was
appointed   in November        1850   assistant    engineer     on the Central
Railroad of New Jersey, under        J.  Laurie, Esq., C.E., he being then
not quite  18 years   of  age.   He remained in America till June 1852,
during which time he was actively         engaged     in laying out the Erie
and Forest    Lawn Cemeteries, superintending             the building of the
Berks    Caunty Baths, the Buffalo Public Wash-houses,                   &c, and
occasionally giving lectures on architectural and engineering subjects.
Dr Calvin Fairbanks, in      a letter dated 1st October 1851, speaks          thus
of his ability as a  lecturer : — " I must     say   I was   gratified with the
clearness  with which you presented the necessity of developing the
yet undeveloped facts in architecture, in your last evening's lecture.
It would have been happy had there been            a more general interest      at
an earlier period.      I  hope, Sir,  it may be convenient for you to
favour us again with a repetition of the same, followed               by illustra
tions and remarks."
   Almost immediately on his return to England, Mr Rumble
obtained work in Kensington, superintending the building of All
Saints' Church and the laying out of the Kensington Park Estate.
   In  October 1853 he went out to Bombay,               as assistant engineer
on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, then in course
of construction.    An attack of fever obliged him to return on sick

   1. On the so-called       Bicipital Ribs.       By Professor William
                                    Turner.
    In this   paper an anatomical peculiarity          was described which is
occasionally    found both in Man and the Cetacea.              It is not due to
a  bifurcation of the shaft of   a  single rib at its vertebral end into two
heads, but to the fusion of what ought to have been the shafts of
two distinct ribs into    a common body, and        it invariably occurs   at the
apex of the thorax.        Although the author had long been familiar
with dried specimens from the human body in the Anatomical
Museum of the University of Edinburgh, two cases which he now
describes were the first that he had seen in the subject itself in the
course of nearly thirty years'       experience as a teacher of anatomy,
and   it is remarkable that they should both have occurred within               a
few months of each other.         A third   specimen occurred in a skeleton
in the possession of     one of his pupils,   Mr Minas      S.  P. Aganoor.
    A specimen from      a large Cetacean    was also shown and described.
It  formed a part of the skeleton of      a Balimoptera,      some of the bones
of which     were  found in 1859, others in 18G3, embedded in clay             in

about 100 yards from the bed of the River Forth.                 They were lying
in the "blue 6link," from         13 to 14 feet    below the present surface,
 and from 3 to 4 feet above the present high-water mark.
    The following conclusions were stated           : —
    1.  In  both Man and the Cetacea            cervical ribs are occasionally
 developed in connection with the 7th vertebra.
    2.  In both the cervical ribs may remain free or be fused with the
 1st thoracic rib, so as to make       it bicipital.
    3. In Man     a similar   bicipital form may       be due to fusion    of the
shafts of the 1st    and 2nd thoracic ribs with         each other at their verte
bral ends, and it is probable that this may also occur in the Cetacea.
    4. In  either of the forms of fusion specified in 2 and 3, the two
limbs, into which the vertebral end is divided, lie in different trans
verse planes, and the bifurcation         is due to the partial fusion of two
morphologically      distinct rib-elements.
   5.  The   presence   of a cervical rib, or the bicipital form of the 1st
rib, is only an individual peculiarity, and is not to            bo regarded as
affording any evidence of either specific or generic difference.

    1.     On the Impossibility of Inverted Images in the Air.
                                   By Edward Sang.
  It    is narrated that         a physician,      having     given cogent reasons to
show that there could              bo no recovery, and somewhat disconcerted
by the return of sound health, yet maintained the cogency of his
pathological arguments.              The present may be           a   new edition of the
same story ; however, we shall advance the arguments, and leave                        it
to futurity to tell whether there be any patient at all.
    In order       that an inverted image of any object be seen in the
air, it    is,
          in       the first place, requisite that the light from that object,
proceeding obliquely upwards, be bent again down to reach the eye
of the observer; and, in the                 second     place,   that this retroflection
occur in     a    determinate manner,         so   that the lights proceeding from
different parts of the object may arrive in contiguous directions.
These      effects must be produced by the action of the air.                   The law
according to which transparent media change the direction of light
lias been well known             from direct experiment, and the index of re
fraction of air         has been carefully    measured.
   In    proceeding upwards, the light reaches air of gradually decreas
ing refractive power,            so that the path        is   curved, the form of the
curve depending on the law of diminution of the air's density, and
also on the earth's             roundness.     The manner of the diminution of
density      is   imperfectly      known, and hence astronomers encounter
great difficulty in investigating              the amount of refraction          for the
stars  ;   that amount, in fact, being computed from empirical formulie.
Yet there         are    relations among the heights, refractive            powers and
directions,       very easily investigated      ;     and, because     of its great sim
plicity    as    well   as   for the sake of those who may not previously have
looked at the matter or who may have been frightened by the dis
play of algebraic symbols,         I    shall here give the analysis.
  If    the air were composed of concentric layers, each, within itself,

of uniform        density, the path of the light would                                be a series   of
straight lines, AB, BC             .  .  .   GS    ;   refraction taking place at each
junction.
     If  0   be the earth's      centre, and            AB    the path of the            light in the
first layer, the angle OAB, called by astronomers                              the nadir-distance,
 is the incidence of the light upon the surface                                 at    A, while OBA
 measures      the incidence of the same light upon the surface at B                                   ;
 and according to the most elementary laws of geometry,                                  we have the
 proportion
                          sin  OAB      :   sin  OBA       : :  OB     :   OA     .
      If now   fi0 , fil  be the indices of refraction for the first and second
  layers, the refraction at          B   must, according to the well-known                        law,
  be such that
                           sin OBA        :  sin OBC        : : /x, :
                                                                         /i0 ,
  so   that, on combining the two ratios, we have
                     sin  OAB    :   sin OBC         : : OB    . H    :   OA      .
                                                                                    H,
   which proportion may also be represented                        by the equality
                       sin OAB . OA . ^ = sin OBC . OB                         . /x, .
   The analogous        equality holds for the patli BC, and so along the
   whole course of the light, wherefore the continued product of the
   sine of the incidence, the radius vector and the index of refraction,
   is constant all along      ; that is to say, the equality
                       sin  OAB . OA          . p0      sin OGS      .    OG    .
                                                                                    H

                                of Edinburgh,            Session 1882-83.                          131
hoMs good independently                         of the variations     between          the points    A
and G, and of the thickness or thinness of the supposed                                  layers.
   Hence           if   these      three factors       be known    for any one point in the
path, and               if two of       them be given for another point, the third
factor corresponding                  to that point may be at once computed.
   In this part of the theory of atmospheric refraction                                  there is no
difficulty     ;    the astronomer's trouble is in discovering the geocentric
angle    AOG.
   If    the earth            had been flat, the computations would have been
still simpler           ;   the product of the sine of the zenith distance by the
index of refraction would have been constant,                          independently of the
height, and the astronomer would have deduced the true from tho
apparent       place         of    a star by a simple proportion.
   M. Biot has given the index of refraction for air at 1.000                                      294.
It varies with the pressure and temperature, and the formula

had      the        6ine of         its zenith distance augmented                 in   the ratio of
1.000 000 to 1.000 294;                     and   if   the apparent zenith distance at the
outset had been                   88° 38', that    is, if   its angle of elevation had been
 1° 22',   whose secant               is   1.000 294, the zenith distance at the upper
 surface       of the air would have been 90°.                      No sun,        moon,      or star
 could     have been seen at                a   lower altitude than          1"   22'.     All light
 reaching the eye from                 a   lower elevation must have come from some
 terrestrial        object after having culminated as at B.                       The images of
 terrestrial        objects would have been seen constantly in the air, but
 distorted          by the retroflection, — the amount and character of the

132                     Proceedings      of the Royal    Society
distortion depending on the manner of diminution of the air's
density.
     In   the actual case of the round earth, the              phenomenon         of  a
 reflected image must necessarily lie between the above limit and
horizontality.
     If  a ray of   light leave the point
C, culminate        at B, and reach the
eye at      A with     a zenitli    distance,
which we shall          denote    by A, the
incidence       at   B must      be    90°,   and therefore we     must   have the
equality
                          OA . sin A . 1.000 294 = OB . ^        ,
 or counting in English miles, and taking the earth's radius at 3960,
                            sin  A  x 3961.167 =     OB x p  ;
 now the smallest possible value of the index                  of refraction p        is
 unit,    hence the maximum value of             OB is
                               sin  Ax   3961.167 = OB;
 wherefore, since the greatest possible value of sin                A  is also unit,
 it follows that the utmost limit of OB, under any circumstances
 whatever, is 3961.167 miles; that is to say, no culmination                   of light
 in   the atmosphere can          take placo at a height of more         than 1-167
  miles, or 6200 feet.         But this light must reach the       eye horizontally.
  If    the angle     A  be less than       90*,  the radius vector OB must be
  lessened     in proportion       to the sine ; so that for       A = 88°   38',   OB
  becomes      3960, — that is to say, no inverted image can be seen at an
  elevation of       1° 22',  unless the atmosphere have only an infinitely
  small thickness.
      We     are thus    brought      quite    to home.    Our  researches      do not
   extend into tho regions of the aurora and magnetic arc                  ;  they are
   within the range to which our ordinary barometric measurements
   are   known    to apply    with very considerable precision.
      This result     comes   from the known index of refraction of air, and
   from the earth's dimensions,              irrespective of all usual or unusual
   conditions      of the air below           the limit   of culmination     ;   but it
   requires that at that limit the air should altogether cease.

     Let    ua examine the conditions                   needed in order that the light
become horizontal at             a   lower level — say at the height of half a
mile. In this case the index of refraction at B is obtained from
the equality sin A x 3961.167 = 3960.5 x ^ or
                                 sin   A    x 1.0001 68 = ^B,
¦which       has possible      solutions           within        two   limits — ono when                  na
= 1.000 000, in which                  case    A       would      be   88°     57',       that     is,    the
elevation would          be   1°"03'; the other when                       A   is    90°,    giving       nn
=    1.000 168, which index of refraction would                            be due to        a     pressure
of   17 inches of mercury.              "We have no idea               of how such           a    rarefac
tion of the air at the height of only 2600 feet could be brought
about.
     To    come   still nearer   home, let us propose an altitude                         of only        one-
tenth part of    mile, or 528 feet.
                    a                We then find that with  = 90°,                              A
the index of refraction at the culminating point must be 1.000 269,
which belongs to air under              a   pressure of 27 inches of mercury.                          This
diminution of density cannot                  be due to the lessened                 pressure of the
air, which, instead of
                                 2
                                 -5     inches, would only give                     -6,   or about the
quarter of the required reduction.                          In    lowering          the culminating
point, we      come     nearer to the conditions                  of   a   flat earth, and there
fore to the possibility or probability of                        a   reflected image.              Let     ua
then inquire         into the conditions when the light                             is    close    to the
earth      along its whole path, and tangent to the surface at                                     C     and
at A.
     If   we put    h   for the height in miles, and                   A    = 90°,        the index of
refraction     is
                                                        3960
                                              ^o* 3960 + h'
or developing the fraction into series                  —
                                        (      k            k*                 )
                                        |     3960~39602+                      )
     Even at the absolute limit                h   =   1-167, the second and following
terms of the series are too small to be of any account in our present
inquiry, and thus we may hold that the diminution of the index
would need to be at the              rate     of            = "000 2526             for   each mile of
 altitude.        The diminution of the barometric pressure corresponding
 to this would be 25-26 inches of mercury for each mile, or 00478

134                             Proceedings     of    the   Royal Society
for each foot of rise.                But that        caused    by the lessening of the at
mospheric pressure is only "00114, or less than the fourth part of
what is needed              ;   and therefore we conclude that no light can be
retroflected in the usual condition of the atmosphere.
     Inverted images, then, can only be seen when the air is in an un
usual condition         ;       there must be unusually light air above.                 Now, in
these, as   in all investigations on the subject, the air is assumed to
be   disposed in horizontal layers, each of uniform density ; without
such an arrangement no definite refraction                            can    take place, no      dis
tinct   image,       whether distorted or not, can be formed.
     The absolute need for smoothness of arrangement may easily be
illustrated     :   — The sun's light is certainly reflected from the surface
of the      sea ; yet we           do not     see    an image     of the sun in       the   water      :
we see only a confused brightness.                          When the air is quite still, the
sea becomes smooth enough to give an image,                              which, however, the
slightest breath of wind destroys.                          We cannot       use a dish   of water
as an artificial        horizon, we must cover even our trough of mercury
with    a     glass screen           to prevent        the ripple      caused    by the wind.
Here gravitation                tends to produce and to preserve the evenness of
the surface.          Water is         some     seven hundred, mercury is ten thou
sand times heavier than air, and yet the friction of the air produces
such disturbance.
     Suppose then that we had a liquid as light as, or only a                                 little
heavier than air, and that we had poured this liquid into a flat dish.
Paying no attention to the density of the wind which may blow
upon   let us think how calm the air would need to be that there
        it,
may be no ripple on the surface.                            But let   us add to this the con
sideration of the fact that the almost equality of the two densities
deprives gravitation                of its power to stratify, and we must admit
tliat the slightest horizontal                      motion    would    be destructive       of    all
smoothness.
     Imagine    a     stratum of air of the requisite depth and in its usual
state quite level on its upper surface, and let us place upon that a
layer of light air of the requisite refractive power, we shall then
have inverted          images.         But our strata          are not      liquids
                                                                                  ;   they must
be pressed          upon to keep them from expanding, there must be                              air
above them.            If       the superior air have its density conformable to the
lower stratum so as to be in equilibrium with the general atmo
sphere beyond,          it       must be denser than the inserted layer, and the

                      of Edinburgh,        Session 1882-83.                        135
two would inevitably mix.             If,   on the other hand, the superior air
be conformable to the upper layer its altitude must be greater than
that of the general atmosphere which would                  press   in to displace   it
In   neither case could there be repose.
   But the question         arises,
                                     " how is this layer of lighter air pro
duced]"       It   cannot be from the sun'3 warmth                  in still weather,
because    then the heating is at the surface of the earth or of the
water.      The warmed air mixes with the cold above,                       ascending
while the other         descends,   and giving rise to -the too-well-to-the-
astronomer-known          boiling of the sun's      edge.
   The only other source of such warm air is in the south, whenco
the south-west wind brings           it to    us  in gusts and squalls.         At tho
oncoming of the breeze we may see changes                     in the   appearance     of
distant objects on the horizon ; they are displaced, distorted, hori
zontally, vertically,      obliquely,     according    to the passing whims           of
Eolua       Seldom more than telescopic, they are as changeable as the
squall itself.     "We can scarcely       imagine that the wind should gently
lay a warm coverlet over the quiet cold air of the north and                   leave   it
there in    repose.
   But,    I shall  be told, these images have been seen, your patient is
alive and well, Professor Vince            saw   him from Ramsgate.
   I have already       shown that Vince's narrative            is inconsistent with
ordinarily     known      appearances,      and   I  have pointed        out that the
same observer, after eight years' further               experience as Professor of
Astronomy and of Experimental                Philosophy at Cambridge, was          able
to  see through a telescope magnifying              thirty times,    a  building four
teen miles away in all the beautiful 'proportions of near perspective.
This feat could only have           been     performed by one totally ignorant
of, or utterly      careless    of, the simplest       laws of geometry and of
optics.
    Yet   I  needed    not to have gone so far.             When     a picture is pre
 sented to us, we, without requiring an explanation, form an idea of
 what it     means.      It  may be the picture of a horse, badly drawn,
 yet  still we recognise the limner's meaning, he meant to have drawn
 a horse.      So when       I  look   at    Vince's    figure,  I  perceive that he
 meant to have drawn a sloop            ;  he has succeeded       in drawing    a sloop
 such as neither     I,  nor you, nor any other person ever saw.             But   I see
 a great deal more,      I recognise    in the picture the unmistakable well-
 known features of        an old acquaintance.

136                   Proceedings      of the Royal   Society
    The picture is that of         a sloop floating   on a calm sea with its
shadow in the water         ;   the sharpness of the image is considerably
overdone, very few persons have seen it so sharp.              But the charac
teristic feature is there     ;  the image and the ship are united at the
water-line ; it is a well known and understood appearance.
    Oh  !  but Vince saw it up in the air        !
    "When the sea is smooth, the reflection of the 6ky from the water
and the light of the sky            itself are so nearly   balanced as to be
undistinguished,      hence    the difficulty (sometimes amounting to im
possibility) which the seaman has is bringing down the sun to the
water-edge.       He is unable to tell where the         sea ends or the   sky
begins.
    When the breath of        a  zephyr touches such a sea, it causes  a dark
spaco   which     is foreshortened into a narrow streak.         Such streaks
are apt to be mistaken         for the true horizon, and the sailor-appren
tice may find himself wrong in his latitude ; but the mate or the
captain has been on hi3 guard.
    Here,   then, is the whole         diagnosis of Vince's    drawing: — He
had seen     a sloop floating on a very calm sea, the captain had taken
the opportunity       to air his canvas, some stray spars or some          sea
weed had been on the edge               of  a  ripple in-shorc, and the   Pro
fessor's powerful     imagination had manufactured          wonders out of the
vision.

   This apparatus will      be best understood by a reference to the figures.
The bell-jar   A  (fig.   1) rests,  during filtration, on    a square block  of
bard wood    c, 25 cm.     square    by  25 mm.     thick, over which is laid
a sheet of vulcanised        rubber d of good quality, and not less than
3 mm. thick.      In    the centre is   a  circular disk   e also of hard wood,
13  cm,    in diameter and about          20 mm.      thick, which    is held in
position by four strong brass screws which pass down through the
 rubber   into the     square    block    below.     In   order   to prevent  air

leaking     through    the holes        thus   made,    they    are   rendered      quite
air-tight    by embedding        the screw heads, which are sunk slightly
below     the surface of      e,  in red lead, and by laying, previous to
screwing down, layers of red lead on both sides of the rubber sheet.
The red lead should not, however, spread beyond the disk                     e  on either
side of the rubber sheet, so that the latter lies quite free except where
it is held down by the disk.               In   b is fitted   a single-bore       rubber
cork holding the brass tap          /.    This tap is simply an ordinary brass
tap converted into       a three-way tap by boring a hole g through one
outer wall and through           one wall of the plug, which enables the
operator to establish communication              between
       (1) The bell-jar and pump.
       (2) The outer air and both bell-jar and pump.
       (3) The outer air and pump, the bell-jar being shut off.
       (4) The outer air and bell-jar, the pump being shut off.
   After fitting in the cork and tap, the knee-piece h (fig. 2) is screwed
on.     The object of this knee-piece will be explained later on.                        If
the mouth a bo closed by a rubber stopper, and the tap                     / connected
by a rubber tube with a water-pump or other exhausting                        apparatus
as tho pressure     inside diminishes, the rubber sheet bulges up inside
the bell-jar, and pressing against the lower                   edge    closes    up any
interstices    duo to irregularity         of its own       surface, or to imper
fect grinding of the glass.              A   well-made     water-pump         will give
within half an hour        a high      degree of exhaustion, and          this without
the use of any lubricant whatever.                Where     a very high        degree   of
exhaustion      is required, the application          of   a  little   grease    outside
round the lower edge of the bell-jar is advisable.                  The apparatus in
this form can therefore be used for drying substances in vacuo,                       Ac
For   the purpose of rapid filtration         such complete exhaustion is not,
as a rule, required, and indeed is often             positively detrimental, and
defeats the object in view.
    All  the essential parts      of the apparatus have        been now described,
everything      else  which is required for filtration               being either       in
ordinary     laboratory use, or else can be made with but little time
and trouble, and at almost no cost
    When it is desired       to collect the filtrate      in a beaker or flask, the
 simplest    arrangement is that represented in fig.             1.    Fixed in     a  I  v
 means     of  a  rubber stopper is an ordinary              correct-angled funnel,

fitted with platinum         cone     and filter in the ordinary way.                       To the
stem of the funnel          the glass tube i, bent as shown                        in the figure,
and having the lower end ground obliquely,                          is attached by a short
piece of black        rubber      tubing,       the upper end of the tube being
pushed up so as to be in actual contact with the stem of the funneL
The bend makes it           easy to cause           the end of the tube to touch the
side of the beaker, which prevents                      spirting.           It will    be    found
convenient      to keep several such tubes of different                           lengths    ready
made to suit larger and smaller vessels.                      Before commencing opera
tions it is     as   well to slightly moisten the rubber                           sheet    d with
water.       This is not by any             means     absolutely necessary,           but causes
a quicker gripping of bell-jar and rubber.               The tap being in position
No.    2, and connected          with     a   water-pump in full action, filtering is
commenced        by first filling up           th'3 filter nearly          full with the liquid
to be filtered, and then establishing communication                                 between the
pump and the bell-jar by turning the                   tap to position No. 1.               During
the operation of transferring                 the precipitate to the filter, it is often
necessary to lessen the rate of filtration by diminishing or destroying
the difference of      pressure outside and inside                 of the bell-jar.         Instead
of slipping off the rubber tubing connecting with the pump, this
can be far more quickly and easily done by giving the tap a half-
turn back to position No.               2, and thus        allowing air to rush in both
to the pump and to the bell-jar.   The use of the knee-piece h will
be now apparent, for by it the inrush of air is diverted away from
the vessel inside, which might otherwise                      be blown against the side
of the bell-jar, and upset or broken.                    As it       is,   however, the vessel
inside   is   not at all affected by the inrush of air, however suddenly
the tap be opened                In   this connection          another use of the knee-
piece may be pointed out.                 Several of the otherwise very convenient
and inexpensive         high pressure water-pumps, now                            so much     used,
have     a   tendency to allow the water to run back under certain con
ditions, especially when     high degree of exhaustion
                                      a                    attained.                  is
Filtering directly  into an exhausted flask, such an accident would
cause the loss of an analysis, and                a   valve   is   therefore usually placed
between the pump and the flask.                     Such   a   valve       is   quite unnecessary
while using the above apparatus. The running back of the water
can be at once stopped without diminishing the pressure inside the
bell-jar by giving the tap              a     quarter turn, so as to admit air to the
 pump only.          Even   if   water does run back into the bell-jar no harm

 140                   Proceedings      of the Royal     Society
is done, and by turning the knee-piece downwards the pump will
suck back the water again almost to the last drop.
    It is sometimes necessary        in quantitative analysis to filter a small
quantity of liquid directly into a small weighed platinum basin or
crucible.      For instance, in filtering the alkaline chlorides from             the
last traces of magnesia          in  a silicate   analysis, or, to take another
example, in the purification         of minute quantities of alkaloids.
    This may be readily done by the arrangement shown in fig.                       3.
The small funnel I, instead of fitting into the large stopper at                    a,
fig. 1, is fixed by means         of a small cork      into the wide end of       the
 stout glass tube m (fig. 3).
    In order to avoid loss by spirting, the tube does not dip directly
into the basin, but into the glass tube n. This tube may be made
out of a broken pipette, and is supported by a loosely-fitting                  cork
in the small bell-jar o, which may be most conveniently made by
cutting     off the lower      half of an ordinary         wide-mouthed       bottle.
When the filtration        is over the small funnel        I and cork should       be
removed, and the wide part of the tube m washed                      with    a  very
little water, which      serves at the same time to wash down the inside
of  the tube n.      By this    means the amount        of wash water is reduced
to a minimum.         In   the estimation of alkaloids        the solvent is often
chloroform      or ether, which dissolve india-rubber,            so that   in such
cases a small ordinary cork should be substituted for the rubber cork
in in.     It may be further pointed out that with this apparatus it is
an easy matter to filter liquids containing hydrofluoric               acid, which
attack glass, by using        a platinum funnel       and filtering  directly into
a platinum      basin or othor platinum vessel
     A Convenient Method for Preserving Sulphuretted Hydrogen
                                         Water.
    A  large   bottle  A  (fig. 4) is fitted   with   a  double-bored    cork.     In
the one hole is the syphon tube a leading from the bottom of the
bottle to any convenient point lower than the other end of the tube,
and closed at this lower end by           a short piece of rubber tubing and an
ordinary nipper tap.          Through     the other hole passes the short glass
 tubo  b, bent at right angles, and attached by means of rubber tubing
to a piece of lead piping          c fitted with   a  tap, below which      tap c is
soldered ou to     a  pipu connected with the ordinary coal-gas supply.

   By this arrangement the sulphuretted hydrogen is preserved from
oxidation, and       can    always
be run off perfectly          clear.
The     gas  tap should        as a
rule be kept         closed, and
need     only   be   opened for
an instant when           the sul
phuretted      hydrogen       water
ceases    to flow.      It  should
be     well    oiled     but     not
greased.
    The     only   objection,      if
any, that     I have   been     able
to discover to this method
is that after       a   time     the
smell of the sulphuretted
hydrogen        water     becomes
somewhat       altered in char
acter, apparently        owing to
the formation of         traces    of
some organic sulphur com
pound, the nature of which
I  have not yet been able to examine.

  3. Transmission          of Power by Alternate Currents.          By Prof.
                                    George Forbes.
    When     a current     of electricity is sent through  a dynamo machine
in   the same direction as the current flows when the dynamo is being
used     as a generator, then the field magnets are polarised         in their
normal manner, and the magnetism of the armature is such as to
cause it to rotate in the opposite direction to that in which it turns
•when     generating      a current.     The  dynamo    now acts as a motor.
If   now the current be sent through             the dynamo in the opposite
direction, the field magnets          are polarised  in the opposite manner,
i.e., a north pole is found where a south pole was before.           The same
is true of the magnetism of           the armature.    Hence, in this case the

142                      Proceedings      of the Royal     Society
poles, both of the field magnets and of the armature, are simply
interchanged, and the rotation              is again in the direction opposite to
that in which it runs as           a  generator.*      It  thus appears    that when
a    current     of electricity    is passed      through      an ordinary     dynamo
machine, the armature always rotates in one direction, whatever be
the direction of the current.             If, however, the field magnets or the
armature be furnished with a current fixed in direction, the rotation
of the armature may bo reversed by reversing the direction of the
current in the other part of the machine.
     Such being the case, it would seem likely that                    if currents of
varying       direction    be passed     through    a dynamo       they would     cause
continuous        rotation in one direction.           I  sent the current from a
Siemens alternate-current           machine through         a  small Griscom motor,
which        has  a   Siemens     armature with only           two reversals of the
commutator in each revolution.                 Under    these conditions    the motor
did not move at all, in whatever position of the armature it was
tried.       The    reason   of this is that the      reversals   of direction of the
current are too rapid to allow of the complete reversal of the mag
 netism, both in the field magnets and the armature.                   This   has been
noticed before, and consequently it has been supposed that motive
 power cannot be transmitted by an alternate-current machine.
     When the apparatus was in the                  same     condition   as described
above,      I  gave a rapid rotation        to the motor by hand, and after it
had reached          a certain speed      the alternate-current       maintained     the
 rotation at      a   steady and uniform        speed.     I  put some pressure on
 the spindle of the motor.           It rotated   at the same speed.       I increased
 this pressure.         The   speed   did not vary.         But on continuing       this
 action     I arrived at a point where suddenly the driving action ceased,
 and    if  the motor continued to turn          it was almost entirely owing to
 its own       momentum       ;  but   not entirely      so,   for on removing        the
 pressure entirely,         while the motor was still running slowly,                 the
 speed      rapidly increased until it reached the previous uniform rate.
 The sudden diminution of driving power, when a certain amount                         of
 friction was applied, was very remarkable.
      What is the explanation of this action ?               The fact that  a  uniform
 speed      of rotation is maintained, and never              exceeded,   points    to a
  synchronism         between the revolutions           of the armature aud           the

  clectiie actions are in the same direction as the magnetic.

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1882-83.                        143
   reversals of the alternate-current        as being the true cause.     In the
   Griscom motor the current comes from the source of electricity to
  one arm     of the     commutator attached       to the Siemens     armature,
  whence    it is carried by the coil of wire surrounding the armature to
  the  other arm of the commutator.            The current leaving this arm of
  the   commutator goes round          the arms of the field magnets          and
  magnetises the       poles.    Suppose now that by the rotation of the
  armature the reversal        of the commutator takes place at the         same
  time as the reversal        of the current,     then the two simultaneous
  reversals   will   cause  the current     always  to circulate  in the    same
  direction through      the coils, and one part of the armature    will always
  be  north and the other always south.           But the current exciting the
  field magnets    is constantly being reversed, although so rapidly as to
  allow   of only a very slight magnetisation.            Thus suppose that
 when the      left side of the armature is north, the upper field magnet
 is north, it follows that when this one is south the other is south
 also, so that there is always repulsion and consequent rotation             in a
 direction opposite to the hands of a watch.
    It will   be seen now that when we tried to start the motor with
alternate currents, we had only the feeble interaction              of the two
pieces    of iron extremely feebly magnetised;            but when     we   have
synchronous        rotation, we have the more powerful interaction of a
continuously excited and strong magnet (the armature), and the still
feeble action of reversed magnetism of the field magnets.             It is easy
to see   that if the armature tends to go too quickly or too slowly, the
attractions between the movable and fixed parts             will tend to check
this irregularity.        This accounts for the maintenance of the syn
chronism.       It  is also clear that  if the speed be too much diminished

by causing the armature to do work, the magnetic attraction                               will not
act, and  this amount of work will speedily stop the rotation of the
armature.    It is also clear that if the armature be not revolving in
synchronism, and be doing no appreciable work, the magnetic attrac
tionswill always be tending to bring it more nearly to synchronism.
These conclusions are all in accordance with what I observed.
     This is all that        I have      done as yet in an experimental way on the
transmission  of power by alternate currents. It is easy to follow
out the results which must follow when a machine with a Pacinotti
collector (or commutator) is used, or when a magneto-electric motor
is employed.    But            I
                       will not enter on this subject until    have                        I
experimental data to support these conclusions.
     I   have considered these results, small as they may appear, to be
worthy of the attention of this Society, because of the great value
which      I    attach to the transmission of perfect synchronism.                             It   is
well known that in the construction                          of motors a great deal                 of
ingenuity        has   been expended in ondeavouring                    to obtain a steady
speed,     while the motor is doing                 a variable    quantity of work.            This
difficulty is completely overcome by the                         use of alternate        currents.
It   is true that        the efficiency of my motor was                   small, owing to
the feeble magnetism of the field magnets ; but perhaps this can be
overcome.         I    have said that the motor             I used was one of            the well-
known Griscom motors, and the                         current I used was \\              amperes,
measured        by a Siemens dynamometer.From an exceedingly rough
estimate of the pressure on the pulley which was required to stop the
motor, and the surface velocity                       of the pulley,     I   believe       that     I
obtained about 200 ft. lbs. per minute.
     But it is not the regularity of                 speed   of motors which strikes me
as important so much as the power to transmit absolute                         synchronism
to   a   distance.      It   is,   of   course,    well known that the main feature of
many telegraph systems                  is   "synchronous action."           This   is   the case
with the Hughes printing telegraph, so unfortunately                            neglected in
this alone of all-important European countries. So                            it    is   with the
Baudot         and other modifications of the Hughes, and still more so                             is
it   the case with the autograph systems of Caselli, D'Arlingcourt, and
others.

 4.         On the Homology of the Neural Gland in the Tunicata
             with        the    Hypophysis Cerebri.                 By W. A. Herdman,
             D.Sc., F.L.S., Professor of Natural History in University
             College, Liverpool.
                                                 (Abstract.)
        In    an    ordinary simple Ascidian, where both the branchial                        and
  atrial apertures are at or near the anterior extremity of the body,
  the region          lying between them — the interoscular
                                                         area of Lacaze-
  Duthiers — is small in extent, and contains three important structures,
  the nerve       ganglion, the neural gland, and the dorsal tubercle, lying
  close       together.  The ganglion in such a case is elongated ilorso-
  ventrally,         and       gives   off nerves         at its two extremities,      one set
 ventrally and             anteriorly       towards the branchial          aperture, and the
 other set     dorsally and posteriorly towards the atrial.
        In those species, however, in which the atrial aperture is near or at
 the posterior end              of the body, the interoscular          area is large, and forms
 the dorsal edge               of the body.           The nerve ganglion may remain ante
 rior in position, or              it may   be placed far back so as to be nearer to the
 atrial.           In this      case, the nerves given off from the extremities                 of
   he ganglion            run, the one      set anteriorly       and the other posteriorly.
        Wherever the ganglion may be, the neural gland is always found
 in close relation to               it,   either upon its posterior or ventral         surface,
 according to the direction in which the long axis of the ganglion                              is
 placed.           This neural gland consists of             a   mass of more or less ramified
 caeca]      tubules imbedded in connective tissue, and all springing from
a   central space or wider tube which underlies                           the ganglion.       The
presence           of this organ was first distinctly pointed out by Albany
 Hancock           in 1868,* but this able investigator                does not seem to havo
assigned any function                  to it.
        The mysterious dorsal or "olfactory "tubercle was first described by
 Savignyin 1816, under the name of "tubercule anterieur."                           Since then

ticulum of the prebranchial                     zone, and is formed by the dorsal ends
of the peripharyngeal band bending posteriorly                                  to meet the anterior
extremity of the dorsal lamina.
     The dorsal tubercle             is,   in the simplest form known,                         a   funnel-
shaped depression having                    its wider, circular, anterior                 end opening
freely into the branchial siphon (the tube leading from the branchial
aperture to the branchial sac), and separated off from the prebranchial
zone by       a   raised edge or lip.                The opposite narrower end                     is    con
tinued into          a   fine    canal          running dorsally or posteriorly                       in the
direction of the nerve ganglion. This simple condition      found                               is
in Molgula pedunculata   in Eugyra kerguelenensis, the aperture
                                   ;                                                                       is
still wide, although its edge square in place of being circular.

   In other simple and compound Ascidians, the anterior half of
the edge has been apparently                         pushed backwards                 so as to become
invaginated          and      closely       applied           to    the       posterior       half,     thus
reducing          the circular    aperture to             a   crescentic or semicircular                 slit

to   a   very great extent, and coiled in various directions, sometimes
producing beautifully regular and closely placed spirals, as in Molgula
gigantea. The patterns produced by this curving of the horns are
very numerous, and often complicated but their value in classifica

different individuals of the same species, and on the other hand, are
sometimes very similar in members of different genera or even families.
     Some few forms are known in which,                             in place of being            a     single
curved or spiral organ,            it      is   formed of several distinct irregularly-
shaped apertures, as in Cynthia irregularis                             ;    this   has evidently been
formed by the lips of the primitive simple dorsal tubercle having
become         so   folded      as to      divide the single aperture into severaL
Lastly, there        are cases    in which the organ                    is   even more complicated,
as   in Boltenia pachydermatina,                      so that      it    becomes very         difficult to
trace its derivation          from   a     simple circular opening.
     This variously shaped organ                     is   histologically merely           a   depression
in the connective tissue of the mantle, lined by epithelium                                             con
tinuous        with the squamous                 epithelium         covering the prebranchial

        Since the time of Savigny, the dorsal tubercle has been almost
universally             regarded as           a       sense    organ      of   kind — probably
                                                                                 some
olfactory             or gustatory,           or in some           way capable, as Hancock
                                                                                              *
suggested,             of "testing           the quality of the inhaled                       water."          The
reasons         for this view have                been    —
        1.    The position of the organ at the entrance of the branchial
sac,         where a sense organ would be of great apparent value.
        2.   Its structure — a               ciliated         depression         covered         in     part    by
columnar cells, some                   of which closely resemble                   sense cells.
        3.    Its intimate         relation           with the ganglion, and the                    presence    of
a       nerve     arising         from the anterior end                   of the ganglion, running
towards          the branchial aperture, close                        past the dorsal side of the
tubercle, and presumably                       supplying it with               nerves.
        In    1876,    Ussow       t   showed that the neural gland lying below the
ganglion          was        continued            into    a    delicate        duct,     lined      by cubical
epithelium, which                      ran    forwards          and    opened           into the         tubular
posterior         end     of the funnel-like depression forming                                       the dorsal
tubercle, so           that the variously-shaped slit of the tubercle was thus
shown to be merely the aperture                            of the duct from the neural gland.
Long previous                 to this,         in 1861, Keferstein                     and    Ehlers      J    had
shown          that the funnel-shaped                     cavity forming           the dorsal tubercle
in Doliolum                dentkulatum was continued backwards                                 as a delicate
duct to the                base    of the ganglion, but they regarded this duct
and          its anterior         expansion as a prolongation                          from the ganglion
itself.
    In        1881,    Ch Julin§             confirmed Ussow's discovery, and described
minutely the condition of the gland, the duct, and the tubercle in
several species              of simple Ascidians.                     He also declared that there
was no connection between the nerve                               running from the ganglion to
the branchial              aperture and the tubercle, and that consequently the
latter could           not    be a sense          organ,      and was nothing                more      than the
opening         of the duct.             In       a second paper published                    shortly after
wards,         Julin|| described               the       condition        of     these     organs in           two

additional    species,   and enunciated      the theory suggested to him by
E. van Beneden, that the neural gland was renal in function, and
was the homologue of the hypophysis                 cerebri  of  the vertebrate
brain.    In  favour of this homology may be considered            —
    1. The position      of the gland upon the ventral          surface    of the
nerve centre and above the pharynx.
    2. Its glandular nature.
    3. Its connection with the anterior end of the pharynx by           a duct —
Balfour, Kolliker, and others having shown that the hypophysis or
pituitary gland in higher vertebrates arises as a dorsal diverticulum
from the stomodfeum, but afterwards loses this connection.
    From my own observations on           a number of different forms      of the
Tunicata,    I   can confirm Ussow and           Julin's statements    as to  the
presence   of  a duct from the neural gland and its connection          with the
slit of the dorsal tubercle, and, like Julin,         I  am unable to find any
nerve supplying        the supposed sense organ.          I have, however,      in
several cases seen certain of the epithelial cells covering the eJges
of the slit which had         a striking resemblance to       sense  cells, such
as those  in the ectoderm of Actiniae.           This observation taken along
with Julin's descriptions, and especially with the condition of affairs
                                                            I
in some specimens of Ascidia mammillota which have recently ex
amined, has suggested        to me that possibly the dorsal tubercle may be
both the aperture of a gland corresponding to the hypophysis              cerebri,
and also   a sense   organ, probably of an olfactory or gustatory nature.
    Ascvlia mammillata is        one  of the forms discussed by     Julin in his
second paper.       It   is a large species, with the branchial        and atrial
 apertures rather far apart, and the ganglion at a considerable distance
 from the anterior       end of the body, the interoscular        area   being  of
large extent.      Julin   found that the neural gland in this species         did
 not form     the usual compact mass,           but was in a    somewhat rudi
 mentary condition,       and that besides having       the usual duct running
 anteriorly to communicate with the pharynx by the dorsal tubercle,
it had also    a number     of short funnel-shaped apertures into the peri-
 branchial    or atrial cavity enclosed by the mantle ; so that in this
species the products of the neural             gland might be excreted either
 into the branchial       sac by   the main      duct   and dorsal tubercle, oi
 into the dorsal part of the peribronchial cavity by the lateral shorten
 ducts     This peribronchial cavity communicates directly with thc
 exterior by means of the atrial aperture, and is the cloaoal cavity

                      of Edinburgh,       Session 1882-83.                       149
 into    which   the  rectum and      the genital      ducts   open.     Its lining
 membrane is derived from the epiblast, being formed in the embryo
 by   a pair of lateral involutions which afterwards fuse dorsally.
     In   two specimens of Ascidia mammiUata                   which I had an
 opportunity of examining          recently,    I   found  the   neural    gland in
 precisely   the condition     described by        Julin, but its duct had no
 aperture into the pliarynx, the dorsal tubercle being entirely absent.
The small funnel-shaped apertures into the peribranchial cavity were
 numerous and well developed, so that in the case of these individuals
the neural gland was connected with the cloacal part of the peri
branchial cavity only, exactly the arrangement to be expected                      if
 the gland had a renal function.              Admitting that that is         so, and
 that the neural gland is the homologue of the hypophysis,                  it seems
 possible to me that this, or something like this, may have been the
 condition of affairs in the primitive Chordata previous to the point
of divergence of the Urochorda.*               There may have been           a  renal
gland placed ventrally to the nervous system — not necessarily at the
anterior end only, — and opening on the surface of the body t by
one or more laterally placed apertures — this gland being represented
in the Tunicata by the neural gland, and in the Vertebrate by the
glandular portion of the pituitary body.
    As to the dorsal tubercle, whether it         has now any sensory      function
is doubtful,     on account of the apparent absence             of nerve-supply     ;
but    I  consider that it must have been a sense organ formerly                  —
possibly placed at first on the surface of the body           close to the mouth
 (the branchial aperture), since the anterior part of the pharynx
develops from the epiblast as a stomodaeum, — and                I would suggest
that the connection of      the tubercle     with the duct of the neural gland
may be an afterchange,         caused    possibly by the enlargement of the
pharynx into       a branchial    sac, and the        development    of the peri
branchial chamber.         It may readily be imagined how, as the result
of the formation of these cavities, the dorsal tubercle would           be brought
   •  I have adopted Balfour's   classification {Comparative   Embryology, vol. ii.
1881) as follows :—

                        3. Vertebrata.
    t The lining of the peribranchial cavity into which the ducts open in
Ascidia mammilUUa has been already shown to be continuous with the
 ectoderm on the surface of the body.

150                     Proceedings of    the  Royal Society
into closer relation with the neural gland, and one or more of the
funnel-shaped ducts of the gland might, after having been carried in
from the surface by the formation of the lateral atrial involutions,
come to open        into the ciliated depression of the tubercle in place of
into the peribranchial cavity.           The condition thus produced would
 be very much what         Julin  has described as    existing in his specimens
 of Ascidia mammillata.          If now  for some reason the original openings
 into the peribranchial cavity became suppressed, leaving merely the
 secondary opening into the pharynx by means of the dorsal tubercle,
 we would arrive at the condition found in all ordinary Ascidians.
 It   is not easy to   see what the cause of the change could be, as there
 is no apparent advantage to be derived from it            ; probably, however,
 there is no disadvantage since there is abundant                communication
 between the branchial sac and the peribranchial             cavity through the
 stigmata or slits in the wall of the former,
      This suggestion      as to the    origin of the present structure and
  relations    of the neural gland and neighbouring organs, in most
  Tunicata, implies that the pituitary body in the Vertebrata, which
  has lost     its connection      with the exterior, and probably also its
  function, has a similar history.         In this view I am encouraged by
  some remarks by Balfour          * from which it is clear that he considered
  the pituitary body, judging from its             development,    to have been
  originally     a   sense  organ, opening      into the mouth, and possibly
  corresponding        to the     Ascidian dorsal     tubercle.    Ho   has   also
   suggested   f  as an alternative the    possibility that tho neural gland in
   the Tunicata may be the homologue of the vertebrate pituitary body.
   This is of course the theory supported by van Beneden and Julin,
   and is open to the objection that it does not account for the
   remarkable      structure of the dorsal tubercle.      The view   I hold com
   bines both of those suggested        by Balfour and     Julin, by considering
   the pituitary body as the homologue of the neural gland, and as being
   therefore the rudiment        of  a primitive neural organ % which opened
    in the early Chordata by lateral ducts upon the side wall of the body ;

in    embryo   vertebrates, is regarded as being not its original and
proper duct, but      a secondary connection     which     has been formed    with
a lost sense organ, placed at or in front of the anterior end of the
pharynx, and homologous with the dorsal tubercle in the Tunicata.
     In  conclusion,   Ussow     and  Julin   have conclusively       shown    that
the dorsal tubercle        is not   merely a sense        organ.   The    complex
structure which the tubercle usually presents seems to indicate that
it is not merely the aperture of a duct. Whether, as I suggest, it
may be     a sense   organ into which the duct has come              to open can
scarcely    be determined      on the evidence at present in our hands.

throw additional light upon the matter              are — (1)   The exact course

 5.    On the Quaternion Expression of             the   Finite Displacements
         of a System of Points of which the Mutual Distances re
         main Invariable.        By Gustave Plarr, Docteur es-Sciences.
         Communicated by Professor Tait.
      When   we  try to define, from    a purely geometrical      point of view,
  the rigidity of    a system   of points, we    are   inclined to consider the
  invariability of the mutual distances of the points a sufficient defini
  tion. But when we take this definition as a starting point, in the
  problem    of expressing the finite displacements of the system, we
  soon discover that the invariability of the distances is not sufficient
   for insuring the invariability of the relative positions of the points.
      In this paper we have, with the help of the quaternion-method,
  transformed     the fundamental       condition     of the problem into        an
   equation which presents two separate          factors.     One of the factors
   solves the problem       by representing the displacements           as a screw-
   rotation of the   system.    The other factor gives the geometrical per
   version of the figure which the system possessed           before the displace
   ment of its points.
      From the expressions of the two kinds of displacements,               we arc

152                        Proceedings of         the     Royal Society
enabled to deduce the supplementary condition by which the rigidity
of   a    geometrical system shall be established in all ita completeness.
     Both      these expressions are reducible to the same definite form, each
expression yielding properties which correspond each to the other
in the two kinds of displacement                            To the line representing the
axis of rotation in the screw-rotation                        corresponds the plane        repre
senting the plane of symmetry in the perversion                           ;   to the translation
in the first, parallel to the definite axis of rotation, corresponds a
translation in the second, parallel to the definite plane of symmetry.
     With the expressions combined of the two kinds of displacement
we shall        be able to establish a general demonstration                        of the pro
position       according     to which two given successive perversions                          art
equivalent to a determinate screw-rotation.
                                              §1-
     Let    us consider      first the displacements of two points                    A   and    I>,
supposing that they displace themselves to                          A' and B' respectively.
     Assuming        an arbitrary origin          Oj    for the vectors of these points,
we put
                                  0,A=a,                  01B=/3,

                                 (T(/8'-a')       T(/3-a).
     We transform          the   third of   these equations, by the help             of the two
first, into
     (2)                               Sa'i3'-Sa/3        =   0.
     The most general solution of the two first equations may receive
the form
where      p   and   q   may be any versors whatever.
     By    these expressions the first member                  of (2)   becomes
                                    Spap'tqfiq'1          - Sa/?.
     Let   us call   Z   this expression, so that
                                             Z    =   0
will represent the equation (2).

    We represen    t q   lp by   a single letter r, so that
giving
    Thus we get
                                Z = Sy3(rar"1-a).
    Having generally
    (5)            rar1-a = r(a)-l-r1a) = 2rV.              (Vr a),
we get
                             Z  =  2S. [0.rV(Vr.a)].
    Let   £ be the  unit vector of Yr, and let        us introduce the factor
                                             -1
under the sign S.          Then we get
                          Z=  -2S.[f.$8.r.        V(Vra)].
    Of   course, we see at a glance that Z        will vanish when     we assumo
                                      TVr = 0,
in which      case we get r—       ±1,   and   consequently      ±q=p; this will
 be the first solution spoken of.            But  we    will continue  to examine
the expression of Z independently of the vanishing of Vr.
     Decomposing      tfi into its  scalar  and its vector, we notice that the
 term in Z depending on S£/3 will vanish, because the factor of                S£/3
will have a vector under the sign S. We have therefore
                         Z=   - 2(TV>)S[47£|8      . r . Vfc] ,
 or replacing r by             and grouping the factors,        we get
     (6)            Z=     - 2(TV<ri>)S[£(V£3      .  2-)(pVfr)].
     Thus far     we     could    advance    without      making    any particular
 hypothesis     about the versors p and q.             Now   we see that   if both
 had the same axis, that common              axis would be identical with f,
 and we could at once deduce some further transformation.
     Let   us examine how far the generality             of the solution of Z   = 0
 will   be restricted   if we introduce the hypothesis that p            and q be
 co-axial, namely,      \JVp = XJVq    1
     Considering     this incidental     question     from a purely analytical
  point of view, we observe that the six elements comprised in o' and
 ft  are  by the two first conditions (1) reduced to four independent
 elements, a and /J being given.             By (3) we introduce six elements

contained in p and q taken together, and,                               if we introduce          the condition
     (7)                                  UVj> =           UV2-{,
we reduce to four the number                               of the independent                   elements con
tained in      p    and q.       By this means we do not reduce the number of
the independent elements on which a and                                        ft   depend.
     Considering       the question in its geometrical aspect, we represent
the finite displacements by da and dfi,* putting
     (8)                           a' = a =         rfa,       ff = /3 = dfi,
and applying (5) to the expressions (3), we get
     (9)                da = 2pV(p              .a),        dp= 2qV(Vq               .   fi)

Hence

The directions of Vp and Vq                         are thus     limited to planes respectively
perpendicular          to da and to d/3,                    these planes passing through the
origin       Oj    of a and      fi.     Moreover               these      planes contain            a   definite
point      each.     Namely,      if    we put          (  1

                                                                     = O.

     If    then a and   fi,   da and dfi be given, the axis of                            p    and   q   may   still
remain of an indeterminate position each in its plane, perpendicular
to da, and containing a            +    \da or perpendicular to dfi, and containing

                            TV(dPi-dp1)(dp-dPx)=0,
and   as p represents any          point of the system, it follows that all the
relative displacements dp            - dpx      must be parallel to one another.
  Let us designate by ij the unit- vector in the direction of                                     these
displacements.        "We    shall then have, when £               = p       - p,,
                                            P = P + V9
Applying (1), namely TfJ              = T/?, we get
                                     0   =   g(2Svp-(J).
Omitting g =     0,   which corresponds to no displacement                           at all, we get
                                         dp = 2rjSr)/3,
and

From this, making successively p •= p2, p = p3, and proceeding as in
the case of the first solution, we establish, first tho invariability of
the triangle of which the summits are in pv p2, p3, before the displace
ment, and in p'v p'v        p'3   after the displacement.          Secondly, we establish
the three relations following            :

                           {p'-Pn = p-P3 + 2vSv(p-Ps)>
by which the distances of        p   from   p\, p'v   p'3 are respectively  the
same as those     of p from pv pv ps.
    We now take the scalar of the product member to member. This
 gives for the second member,
                    S-(p-Pi)(p-Pn)(p-Pi)
                   + 2S.)?SV(p - pjip - Pi)     Sr)(p  - Pi),
 where    % represents the summing of the three terms obtained by the
circular permutation       of the indices.    But this sum represents the
 vector
                         vS-(p-Pi)(p-p2)(p-p3),
and, treated by 2Sij, we get a term which reduces itself so as to
give   :
    (21)    S.(p-p\)(p'-p\)(p'-p3)= -S.G>-ftX/>- *)(/>- ft).
    If   we compare the sign in the second member of this result (21)
with the sign in the corresponding result (18), wo see at a glance
that the displacements of the second solution produce a state of
things which is incompatible        with the conditions which constitute
a physically    rigid system, and that therefore the relation (18) alone
characterises tho systems which possess the complete rigidity from
a geometrical    point of view.
    As we have at our disposition         two  different   expressions of the
displacements according to the second solution, namely, the expres
sions (3) (with the values (11) of p and q) and the general expression
(19), we will investigate into the properties of the second solution
in using both expressions.        But we will discuss first the properties
of the first solution, and then, taking up the second, we will at the
same time be able to show the correspondence (from a formal              point
of view) of the properties of both solutions.
                                      §3.
   By the first solution      we have tho expression (17),      of which   we
write again the first

and which applies the       same operator      p   (   ) p'1  to any  point of the
system.     Let us look upon p       as a datum.         Moreover as
                                  P   =P +(iP      ,
we   assume also that the displacement dpl             of the extremity of pl be
given, so that the expression (22) will serve to the determination of
the displacement dp of the extremity of p, which may be any point
of the system, or also, in this case any point invariably connected
with the points of the system of given points.
   Let us determine the point, or locus of points, of which the dis
placement     is parallel  to the axis £ of p.            If p„  designates such a
point we define it by putting
   (23)                           V.        = 0,
or
   (23 bis)                          dPa
                                          =  rt,
where t is   a  scalar to be determined.
   Applying the first of (17) we         get for p = p0    :
   (24)             Po + f'-^i + ^-jKPo-^p-1.
   Transforming this by (5) and multiplying by p"1,                we get
   By this equation      S£(p0  - p^j   remains indeterminate.          Wo repre
sent this scalar by - z and add member to              member
                                - z S£(p0 - ft)
                                    «=               .
Multiplying the sum by - £ we get
   Taking first the scalar of both members gives
   (25)                          t + $t,dPl =   0,
so that t is determined by this relation, and there remains
   (26)              ft-fr+k+Hs^V.W-
   By this expression we        see that p0 represents         the vector of any
point of  a straight   parallel   to £ (z being an indeterminate scalar),
and passing through       a definite point, of which the vector depends
on  p  and on pl and dpv        all the elements of which            are given, or
supposed to be given,

  Subtracting         (24) member to member from (22) in which we re
place p by p      +   dp, and p\ by pl + dpv we get

where we put
  (28)                      ^ = [P(p-Po)p-1-{p-p0)].
  The displacement dp is therefore represented by two components.
The first, which is parallel to £, is the same for all the points,
because     (27) gives, by        S£t/<r = 0,
                                              S&7p =      - t,
and, by (25), the value of t depends on the data alone, and is there
fore a constant.          In   fact, by this last relation we have the series of
equations
  (29)                    -r = S£tfp1 = S£?p2 = S£fps                   =    &c.,
which show that the displacements of all the points of the system,
when projected on the direction                      f give     one and the same projection,
so that we may continue to designate                        fit   by   dp0 as by (23 bis).
  The component             da-   is   perpendicular              to   £,    because,      owing to      (p
«=j>£,   we have
                  Sfr(p    - Po)?"1       =     Sp-Wip - Po)           - Sflp -     po).
  Hence,
                                              S.£7<r =     0.
  This relation assigns to                da-   a   plane perpendicular             to    £.    As to the
direction    of     da-   within that plane, we must deduce                              it    from (28).
By its definition,         da- represents the displacement                          of   p   - p0   after a
conical rotation round the axis parallel to                             £,   which       passes     through
the point     p0,     and which therefore            the straight line (26) repre
                                                          is

the angle of p, when
                                     />   =   co8u    +   £sinM.
   We may transform da in many ways.                                   As, for example, putting
                                               P-Po = 0-i

   This gives the direction of da-. "We then draw the chord MM'

                              Ar  = 2lN = MM;.
   This construction is more laborious than the             one which represents

                                                    £) represents   CM', namely,
the result of the rotation of     CM to the amount of twice the angle of
p round   the axis   f.
   The two components of dp produce, as it is now seen, a dis
placement which would take place if the system was invariably
connected with a screw which, in moving in its nut, displaces itself
along the axis of the screw        to a  distance £t, while the screw turn?

2u
   The displacement, according              to the first  solution,  is therefore
appropriately    called a screw-rotation.
    When the angle of rotation is infinitely small, then the versor p
in the expression (31) reduces itself to unity, and if we designate
by   e the instantaneous axis of rotation £ x 2u, we get by (27) and (31)
    (33)                        rfp = cA +   V«(p-p0).
    In  the expression (27) of the finite displacement dp, we may con
sider now the data to be the six following scalar elements :—
    The   two which determine        £ ; the two   which determine the position
of the axis of the screw by the point where it intersects a plane
perpendicular     to f  passing through         the origin O of the vectors p,
this point being
                          V(V&>0.£)orV.(£V.P<)9,
(the part
            - £S£p0 disappearing in the expression of dp) ; and, finally,
the angle u and the value of t, forming the last two elements.
    Likewise the expression (33) depends on the three scalar elements
contained in t, on the two which determine V(V&>0 . £), and finally
on h, six elements in alL
                                           H-
    For the discussion of the second solution            we  will write the first
of the expressions (20) under the form
    (34)                     dp-dp1      =  2vSv(p-Pl).
    We will look upon         dpt and ij as the     principal data by which to
determine     the displacement         dp   of any point   p, when   of course p,
and p are given.
     Let us determine the point p„ or locus of points, for which the
 displacement     is perpendicular        to n.   The condition will be (analo
gous to (23))     for p =   p,i
     (35)                                S^p, = 0.
    Writing (34) for p = pa we          get
    (36)                    <ip,-rfp1 = 2t?S7,(p«-pl).
Treating this by S      . rj we get, by (35),

or if we represent by C the known quantity,
                              c= -&n(pi+btpi),
we get for the locus of p„
    (38)                           Sw.+      C-0.
   This represents a plane perpendicular to               -q, its distance   from tho
origin 0 of the vectors p being = ijC.
    The value of dp.     becomes,    by (36) and (37),
                               dp.^dpi+vSydpx,
or,
namely,    a vector perpendicular        to   »j,  as we intended       it to  be, and
known, i; and dpl being given.
    If we  subtract (36) member to member from (34) we get now
                                  dp = dp, +      dr ,
where we put
                                dT=2r,Sr,(p       -p.).
The displacement       dp is thus represented         by two components at right
angles to each other       : dp. being constant for any point p, and dr
representing    the   double of the distance of the extremity of p from
the plane (38) in which the extremity of p. is situated.
   As p. is arbitrary in this plane, we may take 17C in its place,                  so

plane    of projection     the   intersection       with the plane (38), then
MN    = 17S1KP - i?C)  and dr =    2MN     - MM'.
   The points M and M' at both extremities of dr                  are therefore sym-

164                   Proceedings      of the Royal Society
metrical in respect to the plane (38), and we will call therefor* that
plane the plane of symmetry.           The component t/r having displaced
the point p into its position of symmetry p + dr, the component
dp, parallel  to that plane (because            perpendicular      to 7;), and being
applied to every point, will shift the system of points                p +  dr out   of
their position of symmetry in causing them to move by a translation
parallel to that plane, definite in direction and distance.                 We    may
designate   the result of both the displacements                dr and dp, by the
name of perversion.
   For  the second    solution we have also the expressions (3) which
we may write now for p and q co-axial (by 11) and apply to

     It   is true that       in the        case of one perversion                             one might         define    f

there would be only five arbitraries but we want to combine two    ;          if
given perversions, we are not free to dispose of the direction

     The results of the two preceding paragraphs will now be applied
to the demonstration of the proposition according to which two per
versions applied in succession                             to      a   given system of points produce
a    displacement represented                    by      a     screw-rotation.
     This proposition may                  be looked upon as known                                    already, but its
demonstration in its greatest                            generality by the quaternion method
has perhaps          not yet been given.
     We      assume that the planes of symmetry corresponding to the two
perversions have been determined and brought under the form
                                    St/t   +   C^O,                S7/r'      +   C' = 0.
 Wo       assume     also      that p„          p'c,     p"c be taken so as to assign to                                p\ a
 position on the line of intersection of the two planes.                                                      Let more
 over       p,, p, represent the vectors                              of two points given arbitrarily
 before the displacement, and let                               p',    p1    be the vectors of theso points

determine   the nature of these displacements.                                            Generally then they
must satisfy the equation              '

  Let us examine the second factor.                                  We have                 as to a,

Thus

  But separately da with dfi on the                              one hand, and da                                  with     dft1    on
the other, give perversions by hypothesia                                       We have therefore

Thus we      get

  Taking the sum, and remarking that                                       a    =-   a   +   da,         ft"   =   ft   +   dfi, we

          1.   On some Properties of the Line of Simple Flexure.
                      By Edward Sang, OR                        (Plates         L*-ITL)
     The       unrestricted          problem,
                                                   " To      find    the form assumed               by an
elastic system when subjected to known strains,"                                         is one of those
mechanical problems which baffle the powers even of the modem
calculus.            It    is only when the change of form is exceedingly small
that we can obtain approximate results.                              In   the simplest case — that
of   a straight            uniform elastic body — there                   is,   so far as  I     know, no
complete solution              ;   and thus I      venture to suppose that the following
remarks may not be devoid of interest                         :—
     If   a    thin flat rectangular plate —              a    physical lino, as            it   were — be
bent by means of                a   string attached to its two ends,                 it    takes a parti
cular form, to which the name " curve of simple flexure
                                                        "
                                                          may be
given.
     From the nature of the                case,   it   is   clear that     if   ABC represent the
bent plate and             AC the string, tho curve must                   be symmetric from the
two ends        ;    so that    if   B   be the middle of the bow and BO the ordi
nate therefrom, the two parts                     AOB, COB must                  be alike.        Farther,
if   a   second spring of the samn dimensions, and bent by                                   a   string of
tho same length, wore placed endways to this one, as at                                       CDE, the
strings        AC,    C   E   being in one straight line,' but the bend being on the
other side thereof, the ends may be conceived as united at                                        C,   so as
to form        a   continuous clastic plate, while tho cord may be supposed
attached to the two ends                  A   and E.
     The       same       kind of extension may              be continued            indefinitely      both
ways     ;     and thus       it   follows that the curve of simple flexure                       is   com

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1882-83.                           1 73
 posed of an endless       succession of equal waves, disposed alternately
 on either side      of a straight    line.    It  belongs, then, to the class of
transcendental      curves typified by the curve of sines.
    Instead of the string we may put two obstacles,               one at each end,
against which the spring may press.               It is obvious that the arrange
ment     ABODE would         be one   of unstable equilibrium,        so that some
slight guide would         need to be placed at C, in ordor to prevent the
spring from      flying to the   one or to the other side.
    When the bending is slight, as shown in the first figure (Plate I.*),
the form bears a considerable resemblance to that of the curve of
sines when flattened to the same degree ; but when tho flexure is con
siderable, as    in the second figure, the deviation from that form becomes
marked ; the angle        of crossing at the points A, C, E, necessarily is
increased.       The third figure shows the form of the spring, with its
continuation,       when the ends are so drawn             together, as that the
curve crosses the axis squarely.
    In the fourth figure the spring is shown as so much bent that
the angle of crossing is obtuse ; the distance between the ends is
less than     the breadth of the loop at its widest part             In   the actual
figure this distance is less than         half of the breadth, and hence the
continuations of the loops intersect each other.
    When the ends        are brought      still nearer the loops      come to cross
each    other more frequently.
    The    fifth figure shows the form of the spring when the two ends
are   brought     together.     In  this case the continuations of the form
are   all included    in its counterpart on the other side and in itself.
    When the ends of the spring are crossed over each other, it takes
the form      of what is technically called        a kink,  as shown    in the sixth
figure.      There the distance of the ends is less than half the width
of the loop, and the continuations               intersect each other.       If that
distance      Were augmented the loops         would stand     detached.
    In   these changes     we have    a  noteworthy instance of the danger of
abstract reasoning as to limits.          While the point C is being brought
nearer      to A, the number of undulations             of the curve within the
 limits of the sheet       increases,   so much so, that      if C were very close
 to  A, the    paper would     be covered by a multitude           of lines, which,
 however fine they may be, would tend to produce blackness.
     If, after  the spring    has been crossed,      we allow C to come back to

174                     Proceedings        of      the    Royal Society
A, we shall have        a corresponding             increase in the number of undula
tions comprised within the limits of the sheet ; the tendency again
being toward blackness.                On making the approach from either side,
that     is,   on taking the functions of a + 8a and of a — 8a, and attri
buting to the variations             8a an     infinitesimally small value,          we   find,
on both sides, the functions to be black                       ;   yet, on making    Sa abso
lutely    zero, we find whiteness instead                  of blackness.
  Such being tho general features of the curve, we may obtain its
details by an examination of one of the half-waves, such as AOB.
For this analysis        it   will    be most convenient                to place the origin of
co-ordinates at tho point            0.    We shall therefore write —
                           *=HP

    We shall also write —
                           Y = OA
                           X    =   OB

for the limits of       these quantities.
    Since, in such an arrangement, the angular tension at the point
P   is   proportional    to the ordinate           HP, the radius of curvature there
must be inversely proportional to the same ordinate                         ;   and therefore

    When the angle       A  is acute, as in fig. 7, there is no difficulty in
interpreting this equation;           but when that angle is obtuse,          as    in
fig. 8, we  have to observe that, in supposing the point                P  to move
along the curve     from B, carrying with it the ordinate             PH,  the area
OBPH increases until P arrive at D, where the curve                   becomes   per
pendicular    to the axis.      Beyond       that limit the motion is towards
BO, the differential      of the    area becomes         subtractive, and thus, for
the  point p in    the figure, s would represent the surface            BPDpHO,
while S  would stand for the          area   BPDpAO.          And whon the spring
is crossed so as to take        A    to the other side of O, as in fig. 9, the
surface  AFO     must be regarded as subtractive, so that the symbol S
then stands     for the  excess   of   BDF     above     FOA
    On inserting the value of dl, viz.,
                                 -dl = dx.      sin a'1
into the equation (2), we obtain
                               - xdx = c2. sin       a. da
which, when integrated, becomes
                          \x* = + c2.   cos a + constant       .
    Now, when x = 0, a becomes A, wherefore the value of the con
stant is - c2 cos A ;     so that
                                  =
                                     c2(cos a

      If, from O         as a centre, we describe the semicircle BCi» (fig. 7), and
draw PAQ parallel to the axis, we have AQS = OB*                                  - HP2 = X2 - **,
wherefore OC : /iQ : : sin JA : sin \a ; and hence                                if,   having            made
Oc equal to sin               iA     to the radius OB, we describe the semi-ellipee
Bcb, the portion                hq   intercepted by      it   must be equal to sin              £a   to the
same radius.              Hence,      if   we draw       Qr parallel to Bb, the angle bOr
must be       \a    ;    and   if    we make      rn equal to      br, the radius On must be
perpendicular             to the straight             line touching       the curve at          P,    or,       in
other words, the direction of the circumference                                 at «    is   parallel           to
that of the curve at P.
      Similarly,     if    a    parallel    to lib were drawn through                   e,   and the arc
intercepted from              b    doubled, we should get the limiting position                             X,
where the circumference                    is   parallel to the curve at         A, that       is   to say,
the angle       JON        is   equal to the maximum inclination of the curve.
      Thus   it     is   easy to obtain,          by calculation        or by construction,                the
value of x corresponding                    to   a    given inclination, or the inclination
corresponding to              a    given value of x, when OB and the maximum
inclination       A      are known.
      We may thus obtain an approximation                              to the true form of the
curve by      a     graphic process.              A    number of lines parallel to the axis,
and crossing OB, having                     been drawn,            we ascertain the angle at
which        each    of them should               be crossed       by the curve, and draw                       •
series      of short connected lines with their inclinations.                                   In this
operation we              have our choice among three processes.                               "We        may
divide the ordinate OB equally, computing the corresponding inclina
tions   ;    we may divide the inebriations equally, computing the succes

curvature.           From equation (5)                we at once       get the value of             c2,   that
is,   of the product rx,              so that the radius         of curvature          is    easily com

is 60°, the circle osculating the curve at B has O for its centre                                                     ;       and
that when the crossing is at right angles, the radius of curvature at

   2.  On the Measurement of Resistance to Electrolytes.                   By
                     Cargill G. Knott, D.Sc., F.B.S.E.
    The difficulties attending the measurement of the electrical resist
ance    of  electrolytes   are  well known,        the rapid   growth    of the
polarisation   of the electrodes especially preventing the application
of the ordinary Wheatstone        Bridge     method.     The polarisation may
be kept down by using alternating            currents, as was done by     Kohl

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1882-83.                      179
 rauBch ; and this method        is no doubt the most general and most
 accurate which has yet been applied.
    It occurred  to me some years ago that electrometer measurements
 might give results sufficiently accurate      for most practical   purposes.
To measure      the difference of potential between the electrodes          by
which the current enters and leaves the electrolyte is of course           out
of the question ;     but by dipping into the liquid two otherwise insu
lated platinum      points which are connected to the electrometer,        wo
may minimise the effect       of polarisation.
   The apparatus used       in the experiments to    be described was con
structed  fully   a  year ago, and was simply   a horizontal glass tube (1 1 "8
cm. long) fused into the sides of two vertical testrtubes, and having
two platinum wires fused into it at points distant             7 '3 cm.  from
each other.      The platinum points just projected into the inside of
the tube, the bore of which was U'9 sq. cm. in cross-section.             The
electrolyte stood in the vertical tubes at a sufficient height to fill
 the horizontal     connecting tube completely ; and into the vertical
 tubes platinum plates were inserted to act as the current electrodes.
 A current from two Bunsen cells         was driven through the electrolyte

  180                   Proceedings    of the Royal Society
  and a standard coil of 10 ohms.           A rocking   commutator permitted
  the electrodes   of the Thomson quadrant electrometer to         he connected
 either to the ends of the standard coil, or to the platinum wires that
 came from      the electrolyte.      In this  way, a simple comparison        of
 deflections while a steady current was flowing gave the ratio of the
 resistances   of the standard coil and the liquid column between the
 platinum points.
    When the current was kept steadily in         one direction, the    platinum
 points became      gradually   polarised to different potentials     ;  but yet
 the difference between the reading when the current was flowing,
 and the reading when the current was stopped, was very constant,
 whatever this latter reading (the approximate zero) might be.                By
 reversing the current from time to time, this polarisation at the
points could be kept down           ; and   in no  case was    the approximate
zero ever so great       as to show    any tendency to fall off appreciably
when left for soveral minutes to itself.
    A  few preliminary experiments convinced me of the possibility of
obtaining     results by this method; but         it is only within the last
few months that a complete series of experiments have been carried
out, for which       I   have to thank     Messrs  J. W. Macdonald       and G.
Gregory Smith, students in the Physics Library of the University.
These gentlemen investigated very carefully            the variation of resist
ance   with density of solutions of sulphuric          acid and water at the

    The graphical representation of these numbers gives a good curve,
giving    1 "23  for the density of the solution of       least resistance.
    The specific     resistances   given by these experiments are all con
siderably too high, and the            more  so the greater the difference       of
potential between        the points.     I think  it highly probable, however,
that with      a longer     liquid column, and       a  stronger    current,  more
accurate values would         be obtained.
     3.  The Electrical Eesistance of Hydrogenised Palladium.
                   By Cargill G. Knott, D.Sc, F.R.S.E.
     That     the electrical     resistance   of   palladium     is  increased  by
 hydrogenisation       has long been known,         but the lack of any very
 definite    information induced         me   to investigate      the matter last
 winter.
   Jn   one   of Graham's papers in Poggendorffs Annalen for 1869,
                                               of the pure palladium        and the
it is stated that the conductivities
                         palladium are as 5-99 to 8 -10.       Professor Dewar, in
 hydrogen-charged
                                              vol, xxvii., gives the further fact
 a paper in Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin.,

 182                      Proceedings          of  the   Royal Society
that the increase of resistance is proportional to the charge, without,
 however, detailing any particulars.
    In   the experiments now to he described, the palladium wire                                   wu
 charged by being made the negativo electrode of an electrolytic                                  cell
 The wire was removed from time to time, and its resistance anJ
 mass both measured.               The palladium was purified of the hydrogen
 by being heated to a white                    heat in a Bunsen              flame — a method!
 which,     though       very effective, was rather                 destructive      to the pal
 ladium,      which,      after several chargings               and discharging, became
 rent and fissured in an extraordinary manner.
    The following are the results of three successive experiments made
 with the     same wire before          it  became so disfigured as to be              practically

    The first member for                each      row     refers to the pure uncharged
palladium.          Hence,       dividing every number by the first in                            the
corresponding          row, numbers representing the proportional                          increase
in the    mass and resistance           will     be obtained, and tho different experi

has been prepared, the numbers of the first column referring to                                   the

    Graphically     represented, these points lie clustered              pretty closely
round     a straight       line inclined       to   the axis, along which mass is
measured at an angle whose tangent is -955, hut this straight                      line-
does    not pass through the origin.              Hence it would appear that the
resistance does      not     begin to grow so quickly, hut that from the point
at   which the mass has become               "1  per cent,  greater than at iirst the
 increase of resistance        is directly proportional to the increase of moss.
     The ratio of the masses of saturated               and pure palladium agrees
 well with Dewar's results.            The ratio of the conductivities is almost
  exactly as   2 to   3,  somewhat greater than that cited above.
     When the palladium            so hydrogenised was used as one element of
  a  simple cell,  of which dilute sulphuric acid and platinum                were the
  other elements, the electro-motive force, as measured on the Thomson

                                                    M.A., D.Sc.
   By Plane Algebra I mean what De Morgan called Double
Algebra.  While ordinary algebra deals with quantities which are
represented          on a straight line, and              Quaternions with quantities
which are represented                       in space, Double Algebra deals with those
which are represented                   on a plane.                     The object of this paper is to
show some applications of this intermediate method.
  The      quantities              considered are conveniently                                denoted by small
Roman letters,              leaving their Tensor component to be denoted by
the corresponding Italic letter, and the Versor component by the
corresponding Greek letter.                              Tims           a denotes         a    line of         length    a
and angle a      ;    b    a    line of length                b, and      angle      /J.      Quantities of this
kind   are related to those                     of ordinary algebra                   as      genus and species,
and the laws of operation for the former are very easily generalised
from those for the latter.
  Expansions              can      be obtained by altering                           the order of the opera
tions performed            ;       for example,                first, by          applying           the       Binomial
Theorem and then resolving                              ;    and        second,      by    resolving and then
applying the Binomial Theorem.

       1.     On the Moon and the Weather.                           By John Aitken.
  When residing in the south of France lately,                             I happened      to look
at the      new moon one evening through the clear air of the " Mistral,"
which was      blowing at the time, and not being able to see the dark
body     of the moon, it all at once struck me that something more was
necessary      than     a clear atmosphere                  in order to enable us to       see   the
dark side      of the moon, and that the dark side would                          be best seen
when the earth was to a great extent covered                          with clouds.
  When we look at the moon when it is                             a few days old we see that
the    part of   it   turned towards the sun is brilliantly illuminated,                         and
that the part         in shadow is dark.              Further, the    degree of   illumination
of the dark      part is known to vary, and is generally supposed to                              be
brightest      when our atmosphere is                 clearest.
  Now it is evident that while the sun can illuminate                                 the side of
the moon turned towards               it,   it   is   quite unable to throw any light on
the parts      in shadow,    as there       is   no atmosphere or anything round the
moon to reflect the         light to the shadows.                  The result   is,   that so far
as the      direct rays of the sun are concerned, the dark side of the
moon would be quite               invisible to        us.
      If we   now transport ourselves in imagination                       to any part of the
moon's surface that          is   in shadow, we would               see   our earth like   a   large
moon, which would wax and wane exactly as the moon appears                                        to
us,    only in the      reverse    order.        When wo have no moon on the earth,
the    earth    will appear fully illuminated from the moon and when              ;
we have        full moon, the earth will shed no light on the moon. In

 188                        Proceedings    of    t/te   Royal Society
addition to these changes               in the illumination of the earth          as seen
from the moon, we would also observe that the brightness                           of the
illuminated part of the earth would vary from time to time, and
from point to point                On   some days more          light would   be reflected
from the earth to the moon than on other days, giving rise to bright
days and dark              days.    These changes would be produced by the
changes         in our atmosphere,         as    it is very obvious that when our
atmosphere is covered with clouds more light                        will   be reflected to
the moon than when the air is clear and cloudless, as clouds reflect
more      light than either land or             sea.     From   these   considerations we
see    that the brightness          of the dark body of the moon is mainly
determined —other             things being equal — by the amount of cloud              in
our atmosphere.
   Tho dark body of the moon being visible, or, as it is generally
expressed,
                  " the old moon        seen    in the arms of the new," is one of
our well known and oldest indications of coming bad weather.                       If the
explanation given above of the illumination of the dark side of the
moon is correct, then              it gives an explanation of the old saying,
and we          see    that this lunar indication,          unlike many others, has      a
                                   " The old moon                                        "
sound physical basis.                                    seen   in the arms of the new
indicates that to the west of us there are at the time vast areas of
clouds.         Now that is the direction from which we receive most of
our weather, and the probability is that many of these clouds are
over the North Atlantic Ocean, and                     will travel eastwards and north
wards, and unburden themselves over the north-west of Europe.
  If    these         conclusions are correct, we might look upon the dark
side of the moon as an outlying signal station, capable of giving us
indications of the more or less cloudy condition of the earth's atmo
sphere,    and with properly constructed instruments, the signals might,
with    some          practice, come to be perfectly intelligible and accurate.
There     is,    however, one unfortunate               circumstance which    will make
the readings of these signals at certain times extremely difficult.                  The
brightness of the dark side of the moon                    will not only   be determined
by the more or less cloudy condition of our atmosphere, but also by
the amount of the illuminated side of the earth turned towards the
moon, and, as this varies from day to day, the interpretation                      of the
signals    will       be   difficult and probably impossible when tho moon
approaches the full, as the illuminated                  part of the earth then turned

   towards the moon is very           small     On the other hand, the diminished
  illuminated area of the earth turned towards the moon, makes the
  lunar indications       in another way more definite,            as the moon then
  reports the cloudy condition            of a much narrower area, east and west,
  of the earth's     surface.        Allowance would, of course, require to be
  made for the more or less clearness             of our atmosphere.
      If we wish to get the amount of cloud during                   the last half of
  the moon,    we can observe           it  as  during the first half ; but now it
 will give us the cloudiness to the east and not to the west of us
 as before.      So     that     if  we    wish   to know the condition         of the
 atmosphere      to the west of us over the Atlantics, during                  the last
 days of the moon, we must have the observations                      made   and tele
 graphed to us from America.
     These suggestions         are here offered       in an extremely crude       state ;
 but as they appear to have a germ of                truth in them, they    are offered
 in the hope that some one with the proper means                      of observation
 may take them up and put them to a practical test.
                2. The       Acids of Opium.            By D. B. Dott.
    The acids which have been described as existing in opium are
meconic, sulphuric,          lactic, and acetic acids.         It is not certain that
the    two latter are always present                In  any 'case they exist in small
amount,     and     are   of little importance.          For many years after its
discovery    in 1805 by Serturner, meconic acid                was regarded   not only
as the    peculiar acid of opium, but as that with which the morphine
and some     of the other        bases are    wholly combined.       In  later years it
has become      known that the morphine exists partly                as sulphate, but
I do    not find that any analyses have been made, showing to what
extent this     is the   case.       The subject has indeed received but little
attention,    as  is evident from the fact that in many of the most
recent publications         it is   assumed    that the morphine exists naturally
entirely as meconate.
     In  1878  Dr C. J. H. Warden of the Bengal Staff published an
interesting    analysis
                            * of Behar opium ash, obtained by preserving
the ashes of       all the      samples      analysed at the Government Opium
Factory for several           years.      The chief     feature of interest     in the

analysis is the large percentage (23 '14) of sulphuric anhydride found,
mostly in mibined with potash. Mr J. Scott, in his Manual of Opium
Husbandry,     gives analyses of poppy plant ash, in which the sul
phuric    anhydride    varies from 5*93 to 10*08 per cent              Mr Scott
points out that the larger the amount of sulphuric acid in the plant,
the smaller is the yield of morphia       : —

                     10-08                             4-65
Referring to     these   results, Dr Warden remarks : — " It would              be
interesting   to ascertain whether or not there is a similar          correlation
between the S03 in the opium ash and the amount of morphia con
tained in the drug.         Possibly the SOs in opium may be directly
proportionate to its richness in morphia."
   In   order to determine whether          this  surmise is correct, the sul
phuric anhydride in a number of opiums was estimated by exhaust
ing the drug with water, adding largo excess of hydrochloric                 acid,
and then precipitating       with chloride of barium.         It was found    that
this method avoided the precipitation             of meconate.      In the table
below are given the percentages        of sulphuric anhydride and morphia
found    in various samples of Turkey and Persian                opium.     As it
 cannot be pretended         that any process      for assaying opium gives
 absolutely   accurate    results, the   figures    under    morphia    are  only
 considered comparative, and as an approximation             to the  truth

 law relating the proportions                      of sulphuric      acid and morphia.             The
 most that can be said is that                     if an opium is rich in sulphuric acid it
 will probably           be rich        in morphine       ;    but the determination of the
amount of sulphuric                 acid could not be used as a means of ascertain
ing the value of the opium.                         The interesting        fact revealed by these
estimations         is the large proportion                   of sulphuric        acid existing         in
opium.         So far as       I   am aware,         this has not been previously pointed
out       It   becomes important                   to know in what manner the acid is
combined.           In    order to determine this we must know what bases
and acids       exist in opium.                    The only alkaloids that need            be taken
into account are morphine, codeine, thebaine, papaverine, narcotinc,
and narceine,        and of         these     only codeine and thebaine excel morphine
in basic power.            The principal mineral                 base present         in opium    is,   as
might be expected, potassium oxide.                           Biltz, in his careful analyses*
of Turkey and            of German opium, gives the                      percentage    of potassium
sulphate as 2-0 to 2-5.                 By exhausting fine Turkey opium with water
and incinerating           the extract,       I     obtained    2   -50 per cent, of ash,        which
indicated       0-95         =
                          SO3 2-06 K2S04.                     This confirms Biltz's results.
We may safely leave out of consideration all acids except sulphuric
and meconic.              It   might         almost be assumed             that sulphuric would
replace meconic acid                in any of the latter's combinations, but to make
quite sure,    I     dissolved        a   weighed quantity of morphia                   meconale in
water, added an equivalent                        of standard sulphuric           acid, and gently
evaporated.          When the solution                  became       filled with crystals, these
were examined,            and found to consist entirely of sulphate.                           Taking
then,    the sample        (b) in the table above given, we find                               that     it
yields 15-3         per cent, of morphia hydrate and 2'01 S03.                              Of this
amount 0-95          per cent,          is   in combination with potash and 0-13 per
cent in combination                 with the stronger alkaloids                  (as nearly as can
be estimated), leaving 0'93 to unite                     with the morphia.              This amount
of anhydride         is   equivalent to 7-04 per cent,                    of morphia hydrate, or
nearly    half      the morphia              in   the opium.        It   would    be confirmatory
evidence       if   the proportion of meconic acid in opium were found in
sufficient to neutralise the morphia.                           This fact        is   proved by the
following experiments               : —
   (1) 100 grs. of opium, indicating                      ll'l    per cent, of morphia, were
exhausted       with      water, slight excess of ammonia added, and the solu-

tion filtered.       The filtrate was rendered          faintly acid with acetic
acid, and then excess of barium                nitrate added.     The precipitate,
after being washed with the minimum of cold distilled water,                   was
dried in the water-bath, and found to weigh 10-31 gre.                    This was
treated   with nitric acid to remove the meconate, and then ignited,
leaving 4-36 grs. BaS04.              The 5-95 grs. meconate       of barium con
sidered as C7H207Ba.H.20 is =3-37 grs. C7H4O7 =                  80  grs. morphia.
   (2) From     a  quantity of good opium the morphia and meeonic acid
were    prepared    with  as   little  loss as possible.    There were obtained
C27 grs. morphia        hydrate and 186 grs. crystallised           meeonic   acid.
The proportion demanded             to form the      normal meconate is 262 grs.
Experiments with other opiums were conducted as in (1), with similar
results, the proportion of meeonic              acid to morphia being even less
than that there described.
   It  is evident that    if  the morphia salts could be made to crystallise
from    a simple extract of opium, much light would be thrown on the
matter under discussion.            With this    end in view, 500 grs. of opium
were    exhausted with alcohol, the alcohol driven off, and the extract
treated with water.        The aqueous extract was digested with purified
animal charcoal, and then concentrated.                 After  some days, a small
quantity     of crystals had        appeared.       These consisted of morphia
sulphate.     (It should     be noted here that while the neutral meconate
readily crystallises, the acid          meconate    has never been    obtained in
the   crystalline state.)        This cannot      be regarded    as an altogether
satisfactory experiment, on account of the small yield of sulphate,
but considering that the extract is charged with substances                 which
hinder     crystallisation, the      result is not surprising;     the use of any
purifying agents which would cause decomposition being, of course,
quite inadmissible.
   To thoroughly elucidate the question would require an enormous
number of experiments;             but judging from the facts ascertained,        I
am    of opinion      that morphia exists          in  opium, partly as    neutral
sulphate and partly       as acid meconate.

    L   12//i   July    1882, Stonvfield House, Aryybxhiri', residence of
C. G. Campbell, Esq. — Was guided by Mr Alexander of Lochgilp
head, to the        hills of Glen Ralloch,            situated to the north of the
narrow neck        of land which      connects       East and West Loch Tarbert.
The rocks        of the hills      are gneiss,      full of quartz      veins.      When
among those       hills,  I   saw many boulders of small size lying on the
sides,   and some       on    the very tops.         Their composition, resembling
clay-slate, differed from the rocks, and                 they were all more or less
angular.      They were mostly         on slopes facing, or exposed to, westerly
points.
    On reaching       a hill   on the north side        of West Loch Tarbert, and
sloping     down due south towards the loch, at an angle                         of about
40°,    and at a height above            the    sea   of   400 feet, fell in with          a
boulder      lying    on the surface,       7  x  5  Jx3    feet.    The rock, visible
 almost directly       under, and at all events very close to, the boulder,
 was    a schistose clay-slate,       but with a sprinkling             of gravel over
 its outcrop.        The     boulder    could     not probably        come     from     the
north, as the      hill in that direction      rises to a   height of about 200 feet
 above the boulder, and is steeper near the top.                  The directions from
 which the boulder might most easily                   have   come are     S.E., S.,      or
 S.W., this last being the line of the arm of the                     sea  called West
 Loch Tarbert.          The hills to the west, and still more to                   N.W.,
  appeared    too high to have allowed the boulder to have come across
 them.

    II.    14//t    July    1882,     Ormsary House (on south bank of                         Loch
Killesport), Argyllshire, residence of Mrs CampbclL — Set                                      out,
under       the      guidance of         Mr Alexander,            to     visit     Clach    Briach
(stone-spotted          hill),   on     which     he    informed         me    I    would find a
number of         large, boulders.
    This hill       being situated a few miles to the east of Ormsary                        House
we had to pass the             " Big Boulder "        near the high road, described                in
a    previous         Report       (Sixth,     p.    14),     and      illustrated       there     by-
diagram       5.
    I    was    again     struck with        the    fact, that at this spot there is a
great multitude of boulders, several of them touching                                one another.
I   counted ten, occupying                a space less       than    2 acres     in extent   ;  one
of these (apparently not mentioned in the previous Reports)                                   meas
 ured 16 x 12 x 8 feet.
     Mr Alexander informed                me that on the         hills along       the south side
of Killesport,         west  of Ormsary       House, there are no boulders; and that
they      occur      only   on   the hills    to the      east of Ormsary House,               with
the exception of two on the sea-beach.                        The only peculiarity which
 I  discovered in these respective                hills   was that to the west of              Orni-
 sary    the sides of the hills facing Loch Killesport are excessively
 Rtoep, whereas         the   hills   to the east of Ormsary slope                 more gently to
 the Loch, and are not so high.                     If   the boulders were             brought     on
 floating ice from the W., or                  W.N.W., would               the     last-mentioned
 hills,    because      of their more         gentle slope,         not have         more   readily
 arrested the ice, and            have    afforded     sites   for boulders when the ice
 melted     ?
     We passed through              a  valley called      Baronlungart,           running E. and
 W.    between        Ormsary and Achoos.                 In    the    bottom of the valley
 there are several spots where the rocks are beautifully                            ground down
 and smoothed,           evidently from the westward.                     This valley is      about.
 00     feet    above      the    sea-level.       A few boulders              are   lying in the
 valley.
     Having reached             the    shepherd's house,          on     Clash Briach        hill,   I
 mounted         a horse and        followed      a peat road         for about a mile in            a
 westerly direction, till we reached                  a   level of about 400 feet above
 the   sea,   and came to         a place   from which we could look down to the
 north on the farmhouse of Tign-a-Kaim.                            The hill, along the ridge
 of which we had ascended, terminated at this place in                                  a  rounded

                            of Edinburgh,               Session 1882-83.                                            195
end, sloping down northward, westward, and southward.                                                    The slope
most thickly covered with boulders was that sloping to                                                       N.W. at
an    angle of about              40°   (see diagram 1).              The three largest were of
the following             sizes   : — 15 x       8 x 5 feet ;        18x9x8                 feet    ;    12x7x4
feet
     The boulders            are    all, more         or less, well            rounded.                  The sides
most rounded              were      those        facing N.W., suggesting the idea that,
after having reached the hill, they had been exposed                                           for some time
to friction from some agent impinging on, or passing over, them.
     They appeared to              be all composed            of one description of rock, viz.,
a compact fine-grained                  gneiss,      which is also the composition of the
Ormsary  "Big Boulder" and its companions, before referred to.
The rocks in ritu on this Tign-a-Kaim hill are soft schist, and on
edge.
     On the highest part of the hill, and about                            20 or 30 yards on the
south side (at A on fig.                     1),
                             there are several boulders in positions
of considerable interest. These are shown on fig.    Where boulder                     2.
A     is   represented on fig.               2,    the ground         is   nearly            flat   ;    at    B,   the
ground begins to slope slightly down south                                 ;    and at D, the south
ward slope           is   as much as 20° or 23°.                     Boulder           D      has       a     girth of
about 26 paces, or 78 feet.                         Its height       is   about 15 feet.                     The size
of   B     is   10 x 10 x 10 feet, and              of A,    6   x   5
                                                                     x
                                                                     3         feet.
     It    was observed that a fragment had been broken off each of the
two largest boulders at their south                      ends.        The form of the fragments
and their proximity to the boulders made this evident.                                                  There may
originally have            been cracks             in the boulders, allowing rain to                            enter,
and the action of frost                     to   split off    the    ends.         Another conjecture
is,   that      if   the boulders, when brought                      to the        hill, fell from any
height, and          if   they had      a   projecting piece of rock at their south ends,
the concussion in the mass, produced by the central solid portion of
the boulder           first striking the hill, might cause the projecting piece
to break off.             The direction of the longer axis of the largest boulder
D     is   about     W.N.W. and E.S.E.
   Not far from these, and also on or close to the highest part of
the hill, there are other two boulders (shown on diagram  touching                                      3)
one another, A being 17x8x8 feet, and         18x10x10 feet. The     B
direction        of the longer axis of              A   is   S.W., and of          B,       JSr.W.           A   small
boulder lies between the two, at the north end, firmly jammed.                                                       It

1%                              Proceedings         of   the   Royal Society
seemed          probable, from the positions of the boulders, that boulder
B     was       the first to come,              and that the others subsequently                       had
been intercepted                by B in their further progress eastward.
            hill the three Paps of Jura, 2500 feet high, are visible,
    From this
bearing W.N.W.     The more distant island of Mull, reaching to a
height of 3000 feet, bears N.N.W.        If the boulders on Loch
Killesport,             above described, came from either                    of   these sources,      they
must have crossed, not only two sounds or arms of the sea, but also
the two or three tongues of land which project from this part of the
coast of Argyle.                 Before, however, that suggestion can be favoured,
it would require to                be shown that the rocks composing the                        boulders
are similar             in composition to rocks in Jura or MulL
    To the west of the Tign-na-Kain hills, above described, there is
another hill, separated from them, by                           a   small valley, on which many
boulders are visible, on the side of the                                 hill sloping to the north.
This hill is almost                100 feet     higher; but          I   could not ascend       it,   much
to my regret.
      18/A      July       1882,        Taynish House, on Loch Sweyn, the property
of Captain Campbell of Invorneil. — The house, garden, and policy
are     at the           point of       a   narrow tongue of land, on the south side of
Loch Sweyn, which projects into the loch in                                       a   S.S.W. direction.
Near the point where this tongue reaches                                    the sea there       is    on   it
a   ridge, running                 (by compass) about W. by S., with                        a   breadth
of about            100 yards, and rising eastwards to                     a   height of about 100
feet above the sea.
    This tongue of land, especially on its higher parts and on its
northern slope,             is   covered by above 50 boulders, the largest of which
arc of the following sizes                  : —
    18x11x8                feet.        Its longer axis lies W. by S., and small end to
             west.         It   lies on the broken edges of vertical strata, as shown
             in diagram            4.     Its longitudinal axis dips to west, at                an angle
             of about 20°.               r,
                                         r,     r   are edges       of the rocks in situ on which

     Diagram     5 is a    ground plan of the surface on which these boulders
lie, — b  is about 100          feet above     the   sea, and    d about 60 feet       ; b,   d
representing      a ridge running            about W. by S. and E. by X., with
the   surface sloping gently down on each side towards the north and
south respectively,          as  shown by arrows and the letters             e, f.     Much
of   this rocky      tongue       on which      the boulders lie has         been    ground
down to     a smooth surface.
    The site of the largest boulder B represented                  is shown in diagram
5 on the northern           slope at B.
    The   greatest       number of boulders deposited                is on the northern
slope (diagram        e,  a, b), as  if they had come from         some north-westward
 point, and had       been intercepted by the slope.
    The position of         these boulders, especially of the largest, renders
 it more probable that they              came by floating ice from the sea, than
 by  a glacier from the land.
    Learnt from       the shepherd's       wife, an intelligent woman, residing in
 the offices of Taynish House, that there are two other large boulders
 at or near     the shore, about          300    yards    south of Taynish          House     ;
 but   bad   weather prevented             a  visit to them.           In the policy of
 Taynish,   close to the avenue, about half a mile to the                     east   of the
 house, we observed             many boulders on        a  hill  side, sloping down to
 the north, at about 200 feet above Loch Sweyn.
    On our return         to Ardrishaig      I   visited again the large boulder at
 Loch Affturrich,         mentioned in the Sixth Report,                  p.  16.    Ascer
 tained that the depth or vertical thickness of the boulder was, at its
 east end,    12 feet, and         at its west end, 5 feet;           its narrowest end
 being therefore towards the west.                Its longer    axis, which is     W.S.W.
 and  E.X.R,     slopes down towards the west.
    The situation of this boulder, relatively to                 the adjoining hills, is
 shown in diagram 6, where B is the boulder                     and    II rocky hills sur
 rounding     the valley,          with small boulders          scattered    over     them,
 shown by dots.            These hills rise        to the    height of from         200   to
 300 feet above the         sea.
    When looking from the boulder towards the west, a range of
 low hills is seen crossing the valley, about half a mile distant, and
 in that  range     a    depression occurs, through which the road passes,
 leading westward to Keills.              The summit level of this depression               is
 about 100 feet above the sea, whilst the rest of the range                        crossing

 198                   Proceedings      of the Royal Society
the valley reaches          to  a   height    of from     300 to 350 feet            The
bearing of this depression from the boulder is                W.S.W., coinciding
with   the direction     of the longer axis of the boulder.           If the boulder
had been carried to the spot where it now lies, from the westward,
it would probably be by ice floating through the depression before
referred to.        For any land glacier the locality seems quite un
suitable.
   On our way back to Ardrishaig we observed, on the hills within
sight   of the     road,    many boulders.         They lie most frequently on
slopes facing some westerly point.              Thus, on   a hill called " Leck-na-
Ban," on      the   north side of the road, at about 300 feet above the
sea, where the slope is towards           W.S.W. at an angle of about 10°, a
boulder 10 x 8 x          6  feet is lying on the edge of vertical strata, the
boulder being      a  light-coloured     fine-grained    crystalline   gneiss, while
the rocks on which it lies are          a  soft slaty schist.
    Near the Crinan Canal at Ballanoch,               on the  hill  above the       high
road, and about half          a mile from the canal, there is a boulder            16  x
9x9      feet, at a height      of about 300 feet above the         sea.    It  lies on
the north side of the valley through which                 the road     passes.      The
general direction of the valley is           N.E. by N. and S.W. by S.               The
longest axis of the boulder coincides with the direction of the valley.
The boulder is lying on bared rocks.                 It seemed     probable that ice
carrying    boulders had floated through this valley, and lodged the
boulder.
    19/A   July    1882, Ardrishaig          Hotel.— In the Seventh           Boulder
Report,    p. 10, a     very partial account was given of smoothed                   and
striated rocks at Kilmory, at the western extremity of the tongue                      of
land    dividing Loch Killesport-          from Loch Sweyn.          I  therefore re
turned there,     to examine the spot more           minutely, in company with
Mr Alexander of Lochgilphead.
   At Ardna, Mr Macmillan's farm,                I saw again the large expanse
of  these interesting rocks.
   The extent of rock surface, horizontally,              is about 13 yards, an«l
vertically, about 5 yards.          The surface in different parts slopes down
towards S. by     E. — S. — S.S.E. — and S.E.,         at angles varying from 30'
to 40°.     They have       been    most severely rutted, on the slopes which
face S. and S. by        E      Where the surface slopes down          S.E it     is not
striated, only smoothed           ; showing     that the striating     agent   did not

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1882-83.                              199
 move in such a direction, as to touch or strike, or at all events prefs
severely on the      S.K   slope.    In  some     places   the striae were seen to
have been more deeply cut at their west ends than at their east ends.
Some of the strise at their west ends are as much as 3 inches wide.
The direction of the striating agent must therefore have probably
been from     W. by S., or due west, to have          made the striae.      Portions
of the smoothed rock surfaces were broken                      into small shallow
depressions, and in these pebbles of hard rocks were observed, some
what firmly packed, and where probably they have                   been  lying since
the time they      were    originally deposited.         It  was   by such tools as
these that the stria? had no doubt been formed on the smoothed
surfaces of the rocks.        A representation of       a few   of  these striae, and
of the depressions in the rocky surface, is given in diagram                7.
   That there must have            been   heavy pressure       on these    smoothed
rocks, is evident from this fact, that though the rocks                 are  dipping
or sloping down towards the south, at               an angle of as much as 40",
the  striae are all horizontal,     or nearly so, — showing that the striating
body was of      such    bulk and weight         as to keep steadily       on in its
course, in spite of the tendency, by gravitation, to slide down the
face of the rock.
   On the hill where          these    smoothed      and    striated   rocks   occur,
boulders of small        size   (comparatively),       and much drift of hard
rounded     pebbles,   are  plentiful.
   After examining       these    rocks  I  climbed     the   hill to the eastward
to a height of about 600 feet, and passed several striated rocks, and
three boulders of the following           sizes : — 11 x   7 x 3 feet, 12 x 5 x    2i
feet,   15x6x4       feet.     Each    boulder     has its longer     axis pointing
in the   same direction, viz.,     W.S.W. and E.N.E. These are situated
near the top, and on the side of the hill sloping down towards the
S.8.E.
   Having crossed the ridge of the hill towards the north, and
descended a little way on the side sloping down towards N.N.W.,
I  was struck      at finding almost all the boulders lying with their
longer    axis  W.X.W. and ES.E. The following are the sizes of
the largest boulders examined: — 11 x6x3 feet (with sharp end
to N.W.), 14x8x3 feet, 14x7x7 feet (its longer axis was
W.8.W.), 21 x 7 x 3 feet, 9x6x4 feet (its longer axis due west) ;
hut   here   there was a change         in the down slope of the hill, viz.,

 200                          Proceedings        of    the   lioyal Society
 towards W. by N., instead of N.N.                       W. This last mentioned boulder
 was    lying not           on drift, as the others were, but on bare rock.
    A little         further east, whore the high road passes through the                            lands
 of Castle Sweyn, but above                      the road, and at            a   level of       about 200
 feet above the sea, found a group or cluster                             of boulders, foui or five
 in number, touching and partly covering one another, as shown                                              in
 diagram        8.     The remarkable feature of the spot                        is,   that the slope      of
 the    hill   here    is    so   steep — about     40° — that      it    was hardly conceivable
how the blocks should, when laid down                                 on such           a   slope,       have
remained         on    it,   and have for ages retained their position.                          The only
probable         explanation          seemed        to be, that beneath                the two lowest
boulders there were portions of projecting rock which supported the
whole group.               The slope of the hill here          is   down towards            W.N.W.         A
study of the whole position led to the conclusion that these boulders,
to obtain their lodgment, must have been brought from                                       W. by N.
   Still farther             east the road          passes over an extensive plateau or
table-land of drift, which has                  a   general height of 120 feet above the
sea.      The farm of Doidlie         gravel pit (almost
                                         is    hero.    Afeet deep)                         S
for the excavation of road metal was examined. The layers of gravel
and sand        in    it    were found to be horizontal.
   All     along the road              towards Ashfield, Deltot, and Achnamara,
largo     boulders occur on both                    sides,    though        not        in   nearly       such
numbers,        as near the open sea at                Kilmory, and          near Castle Sweyn.
   '20tk       July, Ardrishaig. — Was guided by Mr Alexander                                        to the
farm of Ach-na-Brack                   (Field of Spots)              to    see    some       remarkable
sculptured cup-markings on smoothed                          rocks.
   Those rocks occupy an oxtensivo portion of pasture ground.                                          They
are of hard gneiss, and the smoothed surfaces                                slope down towards
about S.W. at               an angle of        10° or 12°.          They have evidently been
smoothed         by natural           agency.          Striaj occur on them at several
places.        The direction          of the striae varies            a    little, being in some
spots from           W. by N., in       others from          N.W.         One small boulder was
soon,     on the west side               of one of the smoothed                        ridges of rock,
and seemed to                have    been      stopped       by the rock               in its    progress
eastward.
   The cup-markings                  arc very numerous, and consist                         as usual of
circular ruts          as    shown in fig.       9.     They are of different sizes                  ;   the
largest    about        2     feet   across.        The straight rut issuing                    from     the

centre,       and cutting   across the circular ruts, had     in  almost all coses
been formed in unison with the downward slope of the rock.                  There
are 20 or 30 of those cup-markings, and they well deservo                   to be
described and sketched. Archaeologists have never yet been able to
suggest any plausible explanation of the object or meaning of these
ancient symbols.

      August      1882.  — Convener    received    from   his  factor, Mr Muir-
 hcad, a chip of a small dark-coloured syenite boulder, found on
 Lamberton Hill, four miles north of Berwick, at a height of about
 6O0      feet  above the sea.    It was found near the summit of the          hill,
 which there forms a ridge running X. and S. It was on the slope
 of the hill facing the west. The only locality in Berwickshire for
 syenite rock is Stenchel Hill, on east side of Cockburn Law, distant
  about 10 miles to W.N.W. The size of the boulder was 30 x 1G x 10
  inches, weighing about 20 stones.           The whole of Lambcrton       II 111 is
  a   mass of porphyry.
                      II.— NOTES   BY   PROFESSOR HEDDLE.
   1.  Excursion from Killin (Perthshire) up the N. awl S. valley of
           Railour, in Kenmore Parish, — over Heasgarnich, 3530 feet, to
           Loch Lyon,    — and  thence dawn     the  Allt Clionoghlais valley     to
           Tyrulrum, accompanied      by Rev.   Mr Peyton, of Free St Luke's,
           Broughty Ferry.
       1.   In Radour valley is found on the slopes of Creag nam Bodach,
   at altitude of 1400 feet above the          sea, a  boulder  9x7x7     feet, of
   " pnre    white quartz," sharp and angular.          The rock of all tho hills
   hereabouts is "flaggy gneiss."
       There is such quartz rock on Creag Mhor and Ben Dor can, situ
   ated to the      W. and N.W.      ; also, a   quartz rock, though not quite
   similar, on MeaU Ghaordie to the east.
       2.   On the Heasgarnich side of the samo valley, there is a boulder
    13 x 5 x   6|  feet, somewhat more      gneissose   than the flaggy rock of
   the district, at an altitude of 1600 feet
      3. Towards the rounded head of the glen, at an altitude of about

 202                   Proceedings      of  the Royal Society
 1650 feet, there are eight other boulders, averaging                 11x5x4      feet,
 and forming      a line  across the valley.
     4.  The   pass at the head    of Loch Lyon is crowded with till, which
 fills great stretches of the valley.              It has been by some means
 shaped or worn into conical mounds, and abounds from the level of
 the lake, at 1100 feet above the sea, down to about 800 feet
 2.   Excursion    from    Killin   to Bowachter,      in Glen Dochart         (Perth
        shire), and thence over Sgiath Chrom, 2780 feet ; Sgiath Cftuil,
        3050 feet ; Meall Chuirn, 3057 feet           ; and     along the ridge over
        Meall na Saone, 2835 feet, eastward              to  Mid Hill, 1977 feet;
        accompanied by      Professor Butler and Mr Colin Phillip.
     1.  On the south side of Sgiath           Chrom, at altitude of 1520 feet,
found two boulders          ;  one   in  size   about a cubic yard, the other
 8x5x4        feet    This last was of hornblendic             gneiss with chlorite,
similar    to a rock seen by me on a previous occasion, between Ben
 Laoigh and Ben        Oss, situated about 10 miles to          W.S.W.
     2.  On the cast side of Meall           Chuirn, found       a valley or trench
running N. and E., about 750               feet  deep, separating that      hill from
the ridge to the east.        On the     east slope   of this trench, found some
loose rock, apparently not fallen from the upper                  part or side  of the
valley, but ice-carried.
    3. Proceeding towards the eastward, found                three small   hills with
flattened summits, each over the 2750 contour line, but not named
on the Ordnance map.          The most northern of these is very precipitous
on its sides, and separated        from the other two by narrow cols about
80 feet deep.        From the top of        one of these,      which we ascended,
we descried a boulder perched on the top              of another hill with preci
pitous sides, lying in a slight depression.               The boulder was appar
ently about      10 feet cube.       Considering     this boulder, on account       of
its position, to be one of interest, we retraced our steps about 300
 yards, to try and reach the boulder, but were defeated.                   There was
over a foot of newly-fallen           snow, which       prevented our finding        a
firm footing, and caused constant and dangerous slipping.
    4. Proceeding       about three miles farther           eastward, towards the
Mid Hill, 1977        feet, we had to cross a depressed          flat surface, now a
peat bog, about 200 feet          below the top of the hilL             The summit

                                                                                 20:;

of the hill consists of flattened rock, whose contour " shows unmis
takably that its form is the result of              a body   of   ice having passed
over it from the west."          Its eastern    end shows marks of having been
broken     ; and some   little  space eastward from the        cliff there is a great
rugged block, which seems to have been detached from the rocky
cliff, and pushed     a  little way    eastward.
3.   Excursion from Luib Railway Station northward, over Beinn
       nan Clock, 2309 feet ; Bein nan Imirean, 2500 feet ; Bein
       Glas, 3139 feet; Bein Dheiceaeh,                  3074 feet ; then down
       stream-valley,    back   to  Luib  ; —  with  Mr   Colin Phillip.
    1.  Found the whole south side of Beinn nan Clach from 2000 to
 2100 feet, sprinkled with boulders from              1 to 3 cubic yards in bulk.
 They consisted of        a   kind of rock differing       from that of the hill,
 being more chloritic
    Found     a line  of somewhat larger boulders lying along the top
 ridge of the hill, stretching in a line towards Imirean.                    Found a
 much rounded block about two cubic yards in bulk upon the solid
 rock of    the very summit      of  the  hill, at  a height of 2309 feet above
the sea (see fig. 10).      The rock of the summit was also much rounded.
    Noticed also the outcrop of some nearly horizontal strata, with
scattered      dislodged      fragments ;      suggesting    the action      of some
moving body which had             been   grinding    on and rupturing the edges
of the    strata.
    Found blocks at about the             same, or rather      lower level, in the
cony between Beinn nan Clach and Beinn Glass, as also at the foot
of the east slope of Bein Dheiceaeh ; but these might have fallen
from rocky cliffs above them.
    During the two last excursions, looking                 across    Glen    Dochart
 southwards, some very large boulders were descried on the               N.E. shoul
der of Ben More (3843 feet).              They were on       a  little flat, at about
from 1750 to 2000 feet up.               These could not be         "fallen blocks."
The ridge on which they rest was too narrow, and the slope too great,
 for falling    masses to have been arrested where they lie.              Ice seemed
 the more probable agency.
    On   a review of the facts observed during the foregoing excursions,
 I  cannot explain      them by the agency of local glaciers             ;  nor can I
 conceive how      a great   solid mantle of ice covering the whole country,

 and sliding over the hills, could have left the number of blocks wo
 saw on their summits.
 4.  Excursion    over the  kills situated    to the east of Loch Laggan,     i'»
         Lochaber,   Inverness-shire.       (IV. and V.   were with Rev.     Mr
        Peyton.)
     Started from Loch Laggan Inn, and went            N.E. by Meall Ghrea-
 lach (1650 feet), Buidh' Aonach (3037 feet), along the ridge to
  Creay Meaghaidh (3700 feet), thence descending upon Moy.
     On the south slope of Buidh Aonach, two grey granite boulders
 were found on a small plat at 2260 feet contour line.
    About the centre of the long ridge, and nearly due N. of the
 centre of Loch Laggan, there is a round and broad eminence 3238
 feet high.     This eminence is bedded with gravelly clay, resulting
 apparently from the disintegration of granite belts in the gneiss.
 We counted on this eminence about twenty-four large and much-
 rounded grey granite boulders, identical in character with those seen
 on the south slope of the      hill above mentioned.      Some of them were
 lying on the surface of the clay, some were half bedded.              Veins of
 granite were found in the flaggy gneiss of the hilL            In  these veins
 there were masses in every stago of being rounded by decay and by
 weathering, becoming loosened out of the gneiss rock, with portions
 of the rock adherent.        None were so large as the blocks lying in
the adjoining     district.
    It  occurred to me that many grey granite blocks considered to be
 boulders    may have originated         in this way, and may have been
 pushed from their birthplace, — as, for example, the blocks seen on
 the south slope of the     hill above referred    to.
    In last year's Report    reference    was made to grey granite boulders
 seen on or near the top of      Craig Dhu (2161), at the mouth of Glen
Roy, about       15  miles west of Buidh Aonach.             Might these not
have originated in the same way          1   No veins, however, were    seen on
Craig Dhu.
       5.  District near Loch Clunie, north of Caledonian Canal.
    1.  In driving   up Glen Morriston, wo observed at the east end          of
the summit of     a  hill about 1000 feet above the     sea, near the junction

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1882-83.                              205
of the River Loyne with the stream flowing from Loch Clunie, " a
grand boulder ;" but it was some distance from the road along which
we were driving, and we could not reach it.
    From Clunie Inn      we ascended       Cam Ghluasaid (3140         feet) ; Cam
Glas (3260 feet) ; Sghrr nan Conbhairean ("Ben-due") (3634 feet) ;
Cam Dvbh Liath (3280 feet) ; and Garbh leac (3673 feet), and then
back to Clunie Inn.
    On the south slope of the first- named hill, at               a height of 1475
feet, we found two grey granite boulders, each about 3 cubic yards
in bulk, stopped against        a little knoll to the S.E.
    3.  On another day     we climbed Stob       Bathaich (2740 feet) (opposite
Am Bathaich), the S.E. spur of Cam Fuaralach (3241), and found
on it two blocks.        At the height of 850 feet, and at a distance of
about 400 yards north of Clunie Inn, several fragments of rock
were found, which we ultimately considered to be fallen rocks.
    At  a height   of about 1520       feet, on the cast slope of the same       hill,
we found several large blocks, which had been clearly transported.
They    are angular, and their         resting on so steep a slope was most
striking.     The largest is represented on fig. 11.
    On the   same   hill, at a height of about 2000 feet, and on its S.S.W.
slope, we found an angular block               13x5x4       feet.     Observing not
 far off an outcrop of rock of the same description                  (white quartzy
gneiss),   about 7 feet high, and bearing             W.N.W., about        65   paces
 distant, and at    a somewhat higher           level, we saw such appearances
 on  it as to convince     us that the block        had somehow been torn off
 from this rock, and lodged where it now lies, viz., about                    15 feet
 below the level of the rock.           Between the block and the outcropping
 rock there is    a gully, or hollow, about         15 feet deep, now occupied
 by   a small stream,    across   which the block must have         been carried, —
 by what agency is the question            (see diagram 11).
     3. We next proceeded over the hill tops the whole way north to
  Achnasheen, and were much interested in the number of cases of
  boulders lying on very steep slopes of high hills.                One of the hills
  ascended was Sgurr na Lapaich (3778 feet).                    From the spongy
  nature of the grass it was the hardest climb                I  ever experienced.
  For about 1500 feet above Loch MuUardoch, the slope was                       at an
  angle of 47°.      At   the height of about 1530 feet (above the sea)
                                                          i
  there rests on the slope a boulder 1 2 x 8A x 7 feet, of hard quortzy

             " Did that stone roll down that slope and stick there ? " I
asked the shepherd who walked with us.                      The instantaneousness
and energy of his        "          "
                           Never ! was delightful.             " And why not        VI

in the hill."        We found, on surmounting               the first heave      of the
hill, 2250    feet, a wide expanse       of hog.
                                    6.  Aberfoil.
   Ascended two small hills.           The first (Amdrum) is a portion of the
ridge of conglomerate rock which, in the east, occurs at Callander,
and in the west crosses        Loch Lomond, forming               a  line of islands.
The ridge thus stretches E.N.E. and W.S.W.
   On this hill       I  found, at the height of 230              feet, a line   of six
boulders of angular fragmentary gneiss (greywacke), stretching from
N. to S.      They were closely adjacent, viz., from              2 to 20 feet apart,
and from f to 3 cubic yards in size.
   To the west of this line, four other similar boulders lay along the
summit of the ridge, and thus at right angles to the first line.                   They
stretched nearly to the top of the hill, viz., to 454 feet

   Mr Murray of No.           169   West George Street, Glasgow, having
during the last two summers spent some weeks in the island of
Oronsay, was so obliging,          at the request        of   the Convener,        as to
search for boulders on these islands, and has sent to the Convener

   Along the       sea-beaches    the shingle       is found     to contain pebbles
and blocks of syenite, grey granite, and greenstone.
   The syenite may probably            have been derived from rocks at              Kil-

      There are also fragments of                    a    bright red granite, with large crys
tals; but no rocks of a similar composition were met with on either
island.         These were found at                 "Port na Long," on the west                        shore     of
Oronsay, and also at                 Poll Gorm, on the eastern extremity of Orun-
say.
      A little to the south of the large sandy bay on the                                      east side         of
Oronsay         (Traigh na Sheila),                 there is a boulder              of coarse-grained
granite,
               " of    a   pinky colour," probably the                   same    kind of rock as that
found at and near Schallasaig.                           Its   size is 3 x 2 x 2 feet.*
   Near this boulder there is one of quartzite,                                 2x2x2          feet, differ
ing    in composition from any rocks                       seen.        Beside it there are nodules
of chocolate          red sandstone          ; also not seen on the island in situ.
   A little to the south in                    a narrow            gully, there is another              coarso
quartzite       4x3x3            feet, partly bedded               in the   sand.
   Highest           hills in Oronsay (304 feet)                       are rounded,       and the rocks
near the base are generally smooth,                            like     those    now washed by the
sea.      No boulders were                 seen on them.
   The strand,             a   low sandy tract, dividing Oronsay from Colonsay
(covered        by the         sea at high          water), has several boulders of small
size on       it,   and in particular          one       of red sandstone and one of                    a   red
dish-grey granite.
   On the west side of the strand, on the farm of Gurbh, there are
several       small boulders of grey granite.

     Near Mcall Buic, situated about              2  miles S.W".      of Schallasaig,      a
great    pit has been opened for gravel and sand.               In this pit,     a number
of boulders occur, the largest about 4 feet long.                    Two of    these have
striae or ruts on their          surface,    parallel with longer axis.            Though,
many arc apparently of Schallasaig granite, there are others,                       which
were not recognised          as the same as      any rocks on the island.
     Some basaltic or whinstone dykes occur on the east coast, a                     little
south of Schallasaig         ; and boulders of these occur to the west.
     At   the foot    of Dungallon        hill (on S.W.       coast)    there   is a sand
pit, with      a considerable number of boulders, from                 1  to  2 feet long,
apparently water-rolled.             The height above the sea is from 40 to             50
feet.
     On the south side of Dungallon, there is Port Loth, where several
boulders (about 2x2x1 feet) of grey granite occur.                          In a gully in
the rocks on N.E. side there is a grey granite boulder, 4 x 2A x 2 A,
                                                                 '

are more, all apparently the             same as Schallasaig       ;  but besides them,
there are some granites of a yellowish-red                 colour, different from any
 rocks seen.
     In  the   N.W. part of Skipness          the   hills are rounded and smoothed,
 but no boulders were scon on them.*

      Along the shores of both islands, and even on inland spots, especi
 ally in Colonsay, there are extensive collections of pebbles and small
 boulders, all evidently          water worn, — some of them               reaching   to   a
 height of 70 feet above the present shore.                 The pebbles and boulders
     *
       Note by Convener. — With reference to the granite boulders, which in most
 cases   Mr Murray seems inclined to connect with the Schallasaig granite rocks, it
 should lie kept in view that at Killoran (in the N.W. of Colonsay) there are,
  as Mr Murray    states,  "rocks   of both  red granite and grey granite, which     rise in
  masses to the height of 200 feet.       The grey is found as far east as liallinahard.
  At the same place there is an exposure of a third granite, of a dark colour, re
  sembling syenite.       In the same neighbourhood the schist is much contorted
  and burnt ; and at its junction with the granite there is a vein of quartz rock
  or quartzite."
     Frofessor   Geikie, in his memoir on the "Geology of Colonsay," already
  quoted confirms    Mr Murray's statement, when he refers to "a crystalline rock
  which appears to be of igneous origin, a syenite consisting of pink felspar and
  dark green hornblende.        It occurs near Skipness, in the north of Colonsay, in
  which district, the schistose and gueissose strata are much broken and confused."

consist chiefly of hard crystalline                   rocks — granite of the grey variety
is the most common, but there is also red granite and syenite.                                    One
specimen of           flint was found, much rounded and smooth,                        as   if   water
worn.        The specimen having been                      sent to the Convener,             he for
warded       it to Professor Heddle for his opinion.       He returned                              it,
stating     that  it   a "
                        is chalcedonic silica," not in the least resembling
what occurs           in " the Liassic beds of our west coasts," and                         he sug
gests     that   it   had probably somehow been transported from Ireland.
    The Convener             asked whether            this flint specimen may not have
been brought           by    a   boat or ship     1    Mr Murray replied that this was
impossible, on account of the position where                        it   was found.
    Mr Murray gives              a   list of the various kinds of pebbles and blocks
found by him in the raised shingle beach on this part of tho coast,
and he has sent chips                of   these   with his notes.
    In this list the following                 are mentioned    :—
    " Red

                             BONALDSHAY ISLAND (OrKNET).
     North     Ronaldshay.          — In    the   Committee's        Keport for 1882 Dr
Traill stated that the rocks in situ consist almost exclusively of Old
Bed Sandstone              flags.   On the surface of the island there are several
boulders of foreign origin, viz., one of
                                                         " coarse   conglomerate^"          a   rock
occurring at Ileclabir, in the adjacent                  island     of Sanday, situated to
the S.W.       ;   smaller blocks          of granite    and syenite, transported                pos
sibly from Stromness,                Pomona       Island, distant         from Bonaldshay
about 45 miles to S.W.,               between which and Ronaldshay there are
several islands and deep-sea sounds ; also a stone resembling coarse
jaxper.       Some of these blocks                have their surfaces flattened                  and
smooth, and in some instances shining, as                     if    they had been ground
down and polished
      In   a subsequent communication              to the Convener, dated 24th             Not.
 1882      Dr Traill       states, that    having recently had to cut              a   number of
trenches or drains through his property near the centre of the island,
he had found               boulder-clay      containing     specimens of           flint, chalk,
oolite, limestone, and sandstone,                  and other stones foreign                to the
island        A portion          of one of these stones having been submit toil for
 examination to            Dr Heddlo, of St Andrews University, he considered
it    to bo a portion of augitic rock, much the same as what he hail
 seen      in tho island of St Kilda, but nowhere                 else.
      In    the     North Bonaldshay boulder               clay, fragments             of marine
 shells occur, especially             Cyprina Islandica, and              traces       also of the
 more fragile Astarte and Dentalium.
    Professor Heddlo writes (16th Dec. 1882) to the Convener regard
 ing theso specimens as follows : —
                                    " send to you one of the pieces
                                                     I
                                        '     '
 of flint which Dr Traill got out of the till of N. Bonaldshay, to
 show how similar it is to the piece of flint you sent to me from
 Colonsay, which I have no doubt came out of Irish limestone.    I
 never saw chalcedonic silica (as this is) in the least resembling                              it,   in
 any of the Liassic beds of our West Coast.
   " Dr Traill has also shown to me among his spoils from the North
 Bonaldshay 'till,' two unquestionable pieces of Torridon conglo-
 mer.ite.          There    is   no manner of doubt as to these.               He saw many

   large pieces     of  it    These must have come from some site between
   the   Kyle of Durness and Loch Carron.
       " Again, another piece of rock is not to                   be distinguished      from a
   mass of granular labradorite,            which     I found     near the summit of one
  of the hills     in Rum Island.
      "I   have taken some trouble with these specimens, qualitatively
  analysing about four of them.               Though somewhat differing in appear
  ance, they are       all coming out        a finely crystalline,      dense, pale yellow
  dolomite, approaching to marble, and so may have come from                           Assynt
  or the    north of Ireland.
      " It is most marked, the great number of pieces of this one kind
  of rock.        I regard it as a 'find ' of importance ; for surely now
  that it has been analysed, the rock can be found somewhere in
  situ."
      In  a  memoir on the Orkneys by Messrs Home and Peach (Quar
  terly Journal of London Geological Society for Nov. 1880), it is
  mentioned, that in the island of Stronsa (not far from Konaldshay)
 boulder clay on the eastern shore forms " a continuous cliff for
 nearly     half  a mile."      "The deposit, which varies from                20 to 30 feet
 in depth, consists of a tough gritty clay, of a reddish colour, full of
 well-smoothed         and striated stones."             "The greater number of in
 cluded     blocks have       been derived        from the flagstones and sandstone
 rocks    of the neighbourhoods            ;  but the following rocks           are  likewise
represented: — Granite, pink porphyri/ic                   fel stone, gneiss, schist, quartz-
 ite, white quartz,        dark     limestone,      oolitic   breccia,   chalk,   and chalk
flints, — all of which         are foreign to the island."             (Page 657.)
      " Equally                      is the presence        of numerous fragments
                     important                                                              of
 marine shells throughout              the deposit."         " Nearly all the fragments
 are    smoothed and striated, like the stones in boulder                       clay; there
 can be     little doubt that      these characteristics are due to the very same
 cause    in both     cases."     (Page 657.)

 localities, and contains finely striated chalk-stones."                     (Page 657.)

        CONVENER,          FROM NORMAN                MACPHERSON,          ESQ.,   PRO
       PRIETOR OF THE ISLAND.
                            1.   Rocks   seen on the    Surface.
    1.   The S.W. part of the island has on it the remarkable ridge                   of
Pitchstone Porphyry, described by Professor Geikie and others, calk's!
Seoe/r-Eigg.        The length of the ridge is altogether about two miles.
It  reaches at its east extremity to a height of about 1300 feet above
the    sea, at   its west extremity to        a  height of from 900 to 990 feet
    It   rises from a plateau, which is about 400 feet above the sea.
    Its   eastern    half runs about E. and W., its western              half N.N.W".
and     N.W.
    Doth north and south sides are precipitous, almost vertical, show
ing on the north        a  cliff  270 feet, and on the south a        cliff 400  feet iu
height.
   2.    The north part of the island, it is believed, consists of bedded
basaltic rook, but, being well covered                by grass and moss, the rocks
are nowhere visible.           The island at its N.E. end rises to a height of
about 1080 feet above the             sea.    At its northernmost extremity it         is
990 feet above the sea.
   The toj) of the hill is          a smooth     plateau,  about half a mile broad,
from which there is         a  precipitous dip towards the         sea, on the   N.  and
E.       It   is also  precipitous towards a Hat basin or hollow                 on the
west, about 180 feet above the sea.
    In this basin      sandstone       and limestone rocks, of the oolitic age
make their appearance.
                         2.  Old [apparently) Sea-Beaches.
    These occur at two spots,             one   in the 8.E. corner of the island,
at a height of about GO feet             above the sea, — the other on the N.W.
end of       the island, about 100         feet above     the sea.     They consist of
pebbles       of rolled gravel, mostly half inch to throe inches in length
closely compacted.
    Except where these beaches occur, there are no gravel beds known
on the island.*
   *
      Note by the Convener. — In the 6-ineh Ordnance Survey map of Rum, two
 "gravel pits" are imlkateil n.s existing in the N.E. part of the island at a
height of about 200 feet above the se;i.

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1882-83.                              213
   The soil everywhere consists, apparently, of the ddbris of volcanic
rocks.
   But wherever the surface is cut through,                  as by water courses,
small stones of       a  kind of granite, from         6 to    18 inches long, are
found.
   Most of the walls on         the island contain stones of this description
gathered off the surface of the land.
   Near the Manse there is a wall and also a dam for water, at about
221 feet above the sea,       in which there       are granito blocks from one to
three feet in length.
                                     3.  Boulders.
   1.   The largest     measured     for  size resta    on the Scoor ridge, being
4J   feet long, 4 feet 3 inches broad, and the thickest part 4 feet.                 It
is angular, and may be gneiss.            It   has a considerable vein of quartz
in  it
   It is    near the western extremity            of the ridge, and on       a part of
the ridge which is lower than any other part, viz., 890 feet above
the sea
   It   is close to the top of the ridge, on the slope facing the north,
and so precariously posed, that the least agitation or concussion by
ice, or even water, might be expected to topple it down hundreds
of feet.
   2. There are other boulders of the same species               of granite or gneiss,
at heights of from 200         to 700 feet above the sea, on ground sloping
from the Scoor ridge towards the N.E., and also from the opposite
bill  down towards       a  water channel.
   In     a wall there     are numbers       of granite blocks of such        a size as
a strong man can lift.
   3.    In  the N.E. part of the island there is          a  granite boulder, dark
in colour, of     a larger size than any other.           It  is on the part of the
hill   sloping down towards the S. W., about 600 or 700 feet below
the top of the hill, and about 300 feet above the                 sea.  A   rock very
like that composing this boulder (Mr Macphereon states) he hassicu
on the shores of Loch Alsh, situated to the east of Skve, about 10
miles north of Eigg.
   The boulders (Mr Macphereon                          " are of every variety       of
                                               states)
gneiss and granite, somo very           dirk,   some very white, some red, sunio
with little or no mica,       S'juie  with   a  great deal."

214                   Proceedings      of the Royal Society
    Mr Macpherson adds that there            are no gneiss or granite rocks in
the island     ; that he has seen rocks of that description              in islands
and on the mainland, to the              N.W.,  ]ST.,  and  N.E., hut that     being
not sufficiently      acquainted     with the qualities       of  these   rocks, he
cannot venture to indicate the sources of the Eigg boulders.*
   *                        — The foregoing report
      Note by the Convener.                           on Eigg having been submitted
to Professor Heddlc, he wrote to the Convener that he had never visited Eigg,
but that lie was well acquainted with the rocks in Rum, Mull, aud Skye. He
states that there U no true granite in Rum ; but that at the S. W. corner of
the island there is a large mass of a " variety of syenite, something like grey
granite" ; and that this syenite, and also the augite rock of the island, are of
the "same type as that of the Coolins in Skye, and of St Kilda."             He adds
that this augite rock is so peculiar, that if the Eigg boulders came from any
of the above-mentioned rocks in these islands, he might perhaps be able to
recognise them, on getting chips from the boulders.
   In consequence of this last remark by Professor Heddle, the Convener applied
to Mr Macpherson, to endeavour to obtain chips of the larger boulders in Eigg.
In the course of a few weeks about a dozen chips were obtained, and were sent
to the Convener.
   The Convener thereupon forwarded them to Professor Heddlc, who, after a
first cursory examination, wrote to the Convener as follows: — "None of the
boulders (judging by the chips) are from any point I know. None are granitic.
One is a micaceous syenite, with characteristic radiation structure in its fel
spar.    There is a micaceous gneiss — I think a Tiree rock. The others are either
highly metamorphosed       grits, simulating granites, or gneissose rocks. All are
so characteristic that their source is certain to be sooner or later discovered.
                                                                            '
The island should be visited, to note carefully the features of the ' lie of each
          "
boulder.
   A few days afterwards Professor Heddle WTote to the Convener, that having
again examined the chips he found that "they consist of highly meta
morphosed grits of gneiss, and of syenite ;— they are all of much greater age
than any rocks described as occurring in Eigg"; and suggested that they
might be submitted to Mr Archibald Geikie and also to Professor Judo, both
of whom he knew were well acquainted with West Highland rocks.
   The Convener accordingly transmitted the chips to Professor Judd, with a
request that if Mr Geikie was in London, he would have the goodness to shov
them to him.
   The Convener has received a note from Professor Judd stating that Mr
Geikie and he had looked at the specimens, and he fixes on one which be says
 " I tukc for Torridon Sandstone. It is an Arkose, which Mr Geikie thinki
may have come from the Torridon group ;— but that it reminds him most of
some parts of the Old Red Sandstone.        None of the boulders arc at all like ana
of the volcanic masses of the Inner Hebrides."
    " All the boulders, wo both
                                     agree, may have come from the great gneiss

VI.— NOTES ON FLINT NODULES FOUND ON RAISED                                      SEA-
      BEACHES AND DRIFT 0 RAVEL IN WIGTOWNSHIRE.                                   BY
      REV. GEORGE WILSON, COR. MEM. S.A. SCOT.
    Mr Milne Home asks             me    (January     1883) for an extract on
this subject from an article by me (in vol. i. of the Collections oj
the Ayrshire and Wigtoumshire Archaeological Association), on the
Ancient Stone Implements of Wigtownshire,                 and to give some addi
tional notes.       The  passage occurs at page 4.
    " The Glenluce implements of flint and other kinds of                 stone,  and
of bronze, were first described in 1876, in my notes of some of the
articles then      presented by me to the Museum                of Antiquities in
Edinburgh (Proc          Soc.    Antiq. Scot., vol. xL      pp.  580-587).        The
Glenluce     flints,  &c,     are chiefly found     on or near certain old sea-
beaches    at the north shore of the Bay of Luce.                 These are about
20 feet above the sea-level,           and run from north-east to south-west,
in parallel     storm-beaches,     from a point near Park Hay, in Glenluce,
to a point near Sandhead, in Stoneykirk, a distance of about six
miles.     These beaches         are  in most   places   covered by sand hills,
called   the Torrs.        They contain many water-worn nodules of flint.
How did         these   flints get there? In the paper referred to,                   I
hazarded      the opinion        that   they are    'the relics of     a   (vanished)
Scottish    deposit    of chalk:'       but geologists demurred to this, and
were    inclined to think           they had    been    imported     as   articles   of
commerce.         One correspondent, who is an eminent geologist, thought
they had     been brought       in coracles from the north of Ireland, where
flint is plentiful          I  am    now able to state      that   they     have   been
deposited by natural agency, for            I have found them in the stratified
gravel,   in  a large excavation at Dunragit railway station, and in a
gravel pit at Genoch, which is near some of the old                  beaches     where
I have found flints, both wrought and unwrought.                     It  is for geolo
gists to discuss whether they have drifted from the north of Ireland
of an ancient river, in which he detected "pieces of red sandstone ' of Cambrian
derivation' — which make it clear that the higher grounds from which tliey
 were borne could not have lain to the S. or E., but to the N. W. or North."
 From fragments of white sandstoue (also found by him), he says, " We may with
 some probability infer, that the course of the stream (which brought them
 came from the north, where the great white oolite sandstones rise to the sur
 face." — Land. Geol. Soc., voL xxvii. p. 309.

 216                   Proceedings        of the   Royal Society
 or some other quarter.            For    archaeologists    it is an interesting ques
 tion whether this deposit of drift contains chipped flints of the
 palaeolithic period.        As yet     I have   found none."
     In   a paper   in the Proc           Soc. Anttq.    Scot, for 1881, new series,
 vol. iii. p. 262,   I  note that these        parallel beaches
                                                                      " are also seen  in
 the cultivated fields in the farm of Culmore in Stoneykirk."
     The fact that many of the flints are not as large as a pea, led me
 to think that they were              not imported       by human agency.          After
 repeated    search,   I  found     flints in situ in the strata of         drift in the
 gravel pits at Dunragit station at 70 feet level, Genoch at 25, and
 at other places.         This fact explains their           presence     on the raised
 beaches and     in the bed of       streams.
    Near Glenluce        three successive sea-beaches            are marked by three
 terraces, more or less distinct.          The lowest, from       15 to 25 feet above
 the present sea-level, is well marked in many parts of Wigtownshire,
 and contains many caves worn in the Lower Silurian rocks.                           The
 two    higher   lines are carried to the north               and west of Castle       of
 Park, by sand hills, now cultivated.                  The second beach is about
 60 or 70, and the third about 100 feet above the present sea-leveL
 In the highest the sand is covered by stratified gravel from 3 to 6
 feet deep.     A fine section is seen in the cutting of the Girvan
Railway on West Borland             farm.     I havo found     no flints there as yet    ;
but there are pebbles of a soft red sandstone, some of which are
larger than      I  can    lift.     Such     pebbles were sometimes            used   as
whetstones, and for other purposes, by the ancient stone-workers.
(A broken valve of           a species     of astarte was got about          three  feet
below the surface at this section.)
    In Kirkmaiden parish             I  have found       large    rolled flints in the
stratified   gravel at the sea-beach          near Drumore village, and smuller
ones    in two gravel pits near Logan House, about 50 feet above the
sea.     I got a single flint in the cutting exposed by the road at the
side of the lighthouse             buildings      at   the   head of the       Mull of
Galloway, about 200 feet above the sea.                  They    are also to be   found
in  a gravel   pit near Lochnaw Castle, about                175 feet above the sea,
and at Machar, in Inch, about 75 feet.
    The great mass of the stones in our drift beaches and river bed*
consists    of pebbles of grey Silurian sandstone.                    There are many
specimens of granite,           chiefly grey.        Boulders    and pebbles of red

granite    are    more     frequent       further    west    in the Eh inn district.
Quartz and quartzite            pebbles are not uncommon.                Many of those
on the sand        hills have been          used   as hammer        stones.      There    are
pebbles of various porphyries                and other rocks which would repay
examination       by trained geologists.            I believe    some   of the materials
of our    drift have       come     from Arran.         Flint   is  plentiful in situ in
Armagh.       At Glenluce the drift is not found very far from the                       sea.
Tlio sections      at higher levels show much boulder clay.                        As yet   I
have seen    no Hint in the boulder clay.

surface   of the animal formed the convexity             of the curve.
   The species may be characterised as follows            : —
                       Pentastomum protelis,       n. sp.
   Body, cylindrical in the anterior half, slightly tapering posteriorly,
terminal segment        obtusely pointed.      No clear distinction          between
cephalothorax and abdomen.          Head hemispheroidal, equal in diameter
to the   body.    Mouth furnished with a papilla, perhaps a protrusible
proboscis.     Stigmata arranged in numerous irregular rows on all the
segments.      Male, 13-17 mm. in length, with 16 or 17 annuli.
Female,     20-25    mm.   in length, unth 18-22 annuli.               Habitat,    the
mesentery    of  Proteles eristatus, enclosed in a connective tissue cyst.
   The above description        being taken from specimens which, from
their encysted condition,        were presumably        immature,       must be re
garded, to a certain extent, as provisional.
   The appearance of the ventral surface of the head is shown                       in
fig. 2.   In  one or two examples the posterior ter
minal segment aptly fulfilled the expression used
by Diesing      in describing another     species,

 means constant.
    The species    bears   a close   resemblance to P. Fig.         2.  Ventral   sur-

polijzonum, Harley, but is distinguished           from it
 by the number of segments,           which, in the case of          P. polygonum,

220                       Proceedings     of   the  Royal Society
is stated to bo constantly            nineteen in fully developed females,* and
it is very unlikely that              an immature          form   should   have   more,
though it might have fewer, segments than the adult.
    With respect to the anatomy of the animal, the following points
resulting from this investigation              seem to be most worthy        of notice.
    Tho cuticle is perforated by the usual stigmata, which are                      seen
in section to        be somewhat       of an hour-glass shape, and immediately
internal to each is situated a spheroidal cell or group of very small
cells (fig. 3, d), with a blunt process              projecting into the stigma, the
arrangement           very forcibly      suggesting      that   the function    of this
aperture is to evacuate           a substance secreted       by the cells.
    The sub-cuticular epidermis           (fig. 3, b) consists of columnar nucleated
                               cells, and in many cases processes can be traced

At first its section is crescentic, with the horns directed dorsal ly.
It   then    becomes        oval, and still       later crescentic again, but      with
the horns directed ventrally.                All this   portion of the tube is lined
with chitin continued from the external covering of the body.                       The

  The      intestine or stomach, for the alimentary                      canal presents no
division into these two parts, has                a   straight antero-posterior course,
and terminates           by    a narrow       rectum      at the hinder            extremity       of
the body.          Two       mesenteries,      not diametrically          opposite to each
other,   but separated by an angle of                 90° to   1   20°, pass from the body
wall     to theintestine, enclosing also two large glandular bodies
                   "
(" Hakendriisen      of Leuckart) which lie one on either side of it.
   The testis is a long thin-walled dorsally-situated sac, as described
by previous observers.              Towards its anterior extremity                   the lower
wall presents       a thickening       in which two grooves               are formed, whoso
walls arch over, and convert them into two tubes, the vasa deferontia,
which subsequently             become united, and then separate again.
  Their course is now round the intestine, one on each side, passing
through the
                   " Hakendriisen,"          until they    reach      the ventral aspect of
the body, where           each becomes         connected with the excretory appa
ratus of its      own    side.
  The genital apertures lie side by side a short distance behind the
mouth, and each leads into an oval sac, to                     all appearance the homo-
logue of that        which contains the cirrus in P.                  tamioides,    except that
in the specimens examined               it   was quite empty.
  From       the       dorso-lateral     side of this sac, on which aspect its
wall is very much thickened, two tubes are given off, one anterior
and one posterior.             The anterior tube enlarges, soon after its                   com
mencement,         to form a small spheroidal chamber, and, subsequently
contracting,        passes     backwards,       extends        some    distance behind the
sac,   and terminates            blindly after     a course         of three or four milli
metres;     the end of it is variously coiled.
   A little anterior to the middle of this tube the                                vas   deferens
comes into         contact with        it,   the walls    of the two         fusing, but the
lumen of the vas deferens               is    not continued           beyond this point        ;    it
terminates        blindly.
   The truth of this observation, so exactly opposed to what might
have been          expected, has been           confirmed by the preparation                   of   a
very careful series           of transverse sections, which show the                     one tube
lined with         a    perfectly    smooth       layer    of epithelium,            passing       by

  222                       Proceedings      of tlu, Royal Society
  the other, utterly ignoring,            if  the expression may be allowed,              its
  proximity, while the vas deferens                fades    away in a mass of rather
 loose cells without showing the least desire to unite with its com
  panion.
      According        to   Leuckart's    account of the development              of  these
 organs in         P.   tcenioidet,   there    is first   formed     a continuous      tube
 extending         from the testis to the external surface, and the curved
 ctecal     tubo is formed later as an outgrowth from it                  ;
                                                                            * this   makes
 it    more     difficult to understand why           a stoppage should        occur in     a
 tube which was once open, and which                      must be open again in the
 adult condition           of the animal, in order to allow of the functional
 activity of the reproductive organs.
      The posterior of the two tubes given off from the                         sac above
 mentioned          does   not extend backwards            beyond the sac itself; its
 lumen is almost filled, and reduced to a crescentic form by                 a cylindrical
 body, attached by one side to the interior of the tube ; anteriorly
 it terminates in         a sharp point, and is clearly homologous               with   two
 conical bodies which Leuckart has described in                      P. ttrnioides under
                 " Chitinzapfen," and which he regards as being in some
 the name                              f

      The apparatus       employed was of         a  very simple character, similar to
   that which was       used last autumn in the           " Triton."
      It  consisted     of  a   narrow    and    a   wide glass   tube, forming      as  it
  were the stem        and bulb of      a large air thermometer.         The stem was
  made     of the most uniform          tube which could be procured, and was
  very accurately       gauged     ;  and the weight of the content of the bulb
  in mercury was         determined.          Thus the fraction      of the whole con
  tent,    corresponding        to   that of one       millimetre of the      tube,,   was
  found.
      This apparatus had the           interior of the. narrow tube very carefully
 silvered     ; and    while the whole, filled with the liquid to be examined,
 was at the        temperature of the water in the compression apparatus,
 the open        end was inserted          into    a  small   vessel containing      clean
 mercury.          Four instruments of this kind were used, all             made of the
 same     kind of glass.

                           Professor C. G. Knott, D.Sc.
                                      {Abstract.)
      When an iron wire is magnetised           longitudinally,     it lengthens in
 the     direction of magnetisation,        according to an old discovery of
 Joule's.       More   recently Wiedemann        showed that when wire is at
 the same       time magnetised circularly it tends to twist.           Thus,  if   an
 iron wire be fixed at one end, and           stretched vertically by means of
  a mass     attached   to  the free end, the free end    will twist round when
 the wire is      both traversed by one current and magnetised           by another
  which traverses      a helix surrounding it.      If the  wire is magnetised       so
  as to   have the north pole down, a down current             will   make the    free
  end    twist in the direction of the hands of        a watch  as   looked at from
  above.       Reversal of either current reverses the direction of twist              ;
  reversal of both         produces no alteration.        Maxwell and Chrystal
   have pointed      out that Wiedemann's phenomenon can be explained
   by means of Joule's.
       In   the experiences     that form the subject of the paper this was
   verified, and      other peculiarities in the twisting       of iron under the
    influence of these magnetisations were         discovered   whicli   tend   more
    securely to establish this relation.        Thus, when the linear current
    (the current    along the wire) was kept constant, the twist reached a
    maximum for an intermediate value of the helical current, this
     critical value being greater    for  a greater   linear current — a result in
     remarkable    harmony with the details of Joule's discovery.
        Again, for different tensions, the twisting under the inlluence of
     two given    magnetisations varied, being (with one or two exceptions)

226                 Proceedings       of  the  Royal Society
greator for thn smaller tension — precisely as Joule's results would
lead one to expect.        This   effect   of tension   seems     to have escaped
the notice of Wiedemann,        but it was undoubted.
   In  the case of nickel, the direction of the twist was different from
that for iron,  a conclusion which Barrett's discovery of the contraction
of nickel under magnetisation rendered not unexpected.                     No maxi
mum twist was reached for an intermediate current.                   Otherwise     the
results wore the same as for iron, as, for example, in the case of the
tensions.
   The experiments       were tried      with different thicknesses of wire,
and all gave the same conclusions.
  3.  Further Note on the Maximum Density Point of Water.
                             By Professor Tait.
   During my long investigations              of the " Pressure-Errors        of   the
'Challenger' Thermometers," but more especially two years                  ago (Pro-
ceedings,  May 1881),     I was led to suspect a loworing         of the maximum
density point of    water by pressure.           For I found      that the change
of temperature of water increased faster than in direct proportion
to the sudden change         of pressure which produced it.               These ex
periments were, at my request, more fully carried out by Messrs
Marshall, Smith, and Omond               (Proceeding*,    July      1882).     Their
result waa (approximately)      a  lowering of the maximum density point
by   5° C.   for  1  ton-weight     of pressure      per square inch (roughly
speaking, about 150 atmospheres).                In  a note appended to          their
paper   I deduced   from their experimental data         a  lowering of 3° -6       C,
and from my own        a lowering of about 3° C. for the same pressure
   In November last, when reducing the observations made in the
"Triton" (ante, p. 45), I found that water becomes more compressiblt
as its temperature is lowered, at least            down to     3°  C.  ; and this     I
regarded as another indirect proof of the lowering of the maximum
density point by pressure.
   I  then determined       to try   a  direct process    analogous to that of
 Hope, for the purpose of ascertaining the maximum                    density pain:
at different pressures.      The experiments        presented    great difficulties,
because   (for Hope's method) the          vessel   containing     the water must
have a considerable cross section           ;  and thus   I   could not use my

                      of Edinburgh,         Session 1882-83.                        227
 smaller compression         apparatus, which was constructed            expressly to
 admit of measurements           of temperature by thormo-olectric processes.
 I  had therefore     to work with the huge Fraser gun employed for
the "Challenger"         work,       and   to use the protected thermometers
 (which    are very     sluggish)      for the measurement of temperatures.
 It  was also    necessary        to work with the gun at the temperature
of the air, — it would         be almost impossible         tc keep it steadily at a
much lower temperature,             — so that    I  had to work in water at about
 12° C.
    The process     employed was very simple.                 A tall cylindrical jur
full of water had two " Challenger
                                               "
                                                   thermometers (stripped of their
vulcanite     mounting)       at the bottom, and was           more   than   half filled
with fragments of table-ice floating on the water, and confined by
wire-gauze at the top.            This   was lowered     into the water of the gun,
and pressure     was applied.
    It is evident that (/        there were no conduction        of heat through the
walls of the cylinder,          and    if the  ice lasted long     enough under the
steadily   maintained        pressure, the thermometers            would    ultimately
show, by     their recording minimum               indices, the maximum         density
point corresponding           to the pressure        employed : — always provided
that that temperature is not lower              than the melting point of ice at
the  given pressure.
    Unfortunately,      all the more suitable bad conductors of heat                  are
either   bodies    like wood (which is crushed out of shape at once
under the pressures employed) or like tallow, &c. (which become
notably raised in temperature by compression).                       I was therefore
obliged    to use glass.         The experiments wore made on               successive
days, three each       day, with three different cylindrical jars.                 These
had   all the   same height         and the same internal diameter.           The first
was of tinned       iron   ;   the second of glass about £ inch thick ; the
third, of glass nearly an inch thick, was procured specially for this
work.
    With the external temperature               12* 2    C,  the following were the
results   of   1J tons    pressure      per square inch, continued       in each    case
for 20 minutes        (some       unmelted    ice remaining      on each occasion).

The coincidence of the first numbers with the ordinary maximum
density      point of water                   is,    of course,       more      chance.            When           no
pressure     was     applied, but everything                       else was the same, the result
was
                        Tin.                               Thin.                         Thick.

It   is   clear that the former set of numbers points to                                 a   temperature of
maximum           density, somewhere about 0°                        C,    under         li tons        pressure
per square inch.                But still the mode of working                       is   very imperfect.
 I        then thought           of trying           a    double cylindrical jar, the thin one
above-mentioned being enclosed in                            a    larger one which surrounded                     it
all round, and below,                at    a    distance of about          \        inch.         Both   vessel*
were filled        with water, with broken                          ice   floating       on       it,   and had
" Challengor " thermometers                         at the bottom.           By this arrangement                  I
hoped to get over the difficulty due to the temperature of the gun,
by having            the inner        vessel          enclosed       in water which would                         be
lowered in temperature to about 3° C. by the application of pressure.
The device proved quite successful.                               The result of          1
                                                                                          1   tons pressure
por square inch maintained                          for 20 minutes, some ice being still left
in   each vessel, was from                a    number of closely concordant trials —
                 Tem]>erature       in outer vessel,                 .          .        1°7 C.

The direct pressure correction for the thermometers                                           is   oidy about
 —   0°1    C,    and has therefore been neglected.
     The     close      agreement          of this          result with        that obtained (under
similar      pressure  conditions) in the thick glass vessel leaves no
doubt       that the lowering of the maximum density point       some                                   is
what under 4" C. for                  1£   tons, or 20,7 C. for            1   ton, per square                inch
It    is   curious how closely this agrees with the result of my indirect
experiments.
     Tho fact, that an increasing compressibility                                    of water at lower
temperatures points to               a     lowering of the maximum density point by
pressure,     is     easily seen from the consideration of the surface whicL
represents the density of water in terms of pressure and temperatiire
as    independent               variables.           Let temperatures               in       degrees         C.   be

                          of Edinburgh,        Session 1882-83.                             229
measured          on x, pressures       in  atmospheres        on y, and density on           z.
Then the section by the plane y =                  1  is a curve with a maximum at
x=     4.    But from this        section the surface rises, in the direction of y
positive,       faster for lower values of x (i.e.,                ^
                                                                   dy

greater as x diminishes).               Hence it is clear that         a  proximate section,
say    for y   = 2,    has its maximum ordinate for               a   value of x     less  than
4° C.
     In   fact,   if  e be the expansibility       of water, it can be expressed              as
a   function of the temperature and pressure alone, i.e.,
                                           e=f{t,   p).
     Hence simultaneous            changes of temperature              and   pressure,    which
leave     the expansibility unaltered, are connected                    by the relation
                                                             0.
     The maximum           density point is      a   particular      case  of this, for there
 the   expansibility is        zero.
      Now,     if   v be the volume, we have
                                          e =

                                    is essentially positive.           But  so is   ^
                                                                                    at

  as the     temperature is above the maximum                        density point.        Thus
  Bp   and   8<   in the  above equation have opposite signs.
      I   have      learned quite recently, and by mere .accident,                     that the
   lowering       of the maximum density point of water has been already
   pointed out as a theoretical result by processes                     essentially the same
   as that      just given; first byPuschl* in 1875, then by Van der
   Waals f in 1876.              Both authors refer to experiments made by

compressibility and the temperature                      of water within                a   few degrees
of 4° C.        It   seems almost hopeless              to attempt           to obtain an approxi

attempted        by both of the authors above named.
    Puschl       calculates        that 87      '6   atmospheres           lower the          maximum
density point by            1°    C.       Thus he (virtually) gives the effect of                   1   ton
per square inch as 1°              7   C.     instead of   2° '7      C.     as    above.      Van dor
Waals gives           a    much more rapid descent,                  i.e.,    from 4J-08           C. at    1
atmosphere           to 3°'4      C.   at 10 5 atmospheres.                   He also gives the
results of some experiments with                         the    ordinary           piezometer,           and
therefore       at very moderate              pressures, which indicate                 a lowering         of
the maximum density point, but do not                               lead to definite numerical
results.

nitrous acid.       This     suggestion      led to an extended investigation              of
the constitution of nitroglycerine               and   of the decomposing action of
various substances on nitroglycerine.                    The conclusion arrived at as
to the constitution         of nitroglycerine was confirmatory of the com
mon belief that       it  is a tri-nitrate of glyceryl.          For it   was found     that
although      nitroglycerine        yielded     a  largo     quantity    of nitrous acid
when    decomposed          by     alkalies,     yet nitroglycerine         could    not be
obtained by acting on glycerine with nitrous anhydride gas, nor                          did
the presence of urea prevent its formation when                      it was prepared      in
tho   usual way by allowing               nitric   and     sulphuric    acids to act on
glycerine.       The     yield     of nitroglycerine         from   a   given weight      of
glycerine also closely agreed with its being                    a  tri-nitrate,    and was
considerably in excess             of   the   yield obtainable        had nitrous       acid
entered     into its constitution.          An analysis of        the elementary com
position     of nitroglycerine,         which     was     carried out in conjunction
with Mr Masson,*           also led to the same opinion.
    With    respect to the decomposing action of various substances on
nitroglycerine,      the novel and interesting result was obtained that
potash,    soda, ammonia,        or an alkaline          carbonate    decomposed      nitro
glycerine, when heated with it for                a  longer or shorter period, form
ing an amount of nitrous acid corresponding almost precisely to the
reduction      of two-thirds         of   the    nitric    acid  which      nitroglycerine
contains.      It  was also found that tho proportion of alkali necessary
for   this    decomposition           was     5   molecules      of    the    alkali  to   3
molecules     of nitroglycerine, and, therefore,              a much larger proportion
of alkali than has hitherto been believed to bo necessary.                         Further,
in direct contradiction of all previous               statements,    no glycerine could
bo discovered amongst tho products of decomposition, which, besides
nitrite    of the alkali,        consisted       of nitrate,    acetate,    formate,    and
oxalate of the alkali,        a reddish aldehydic resin, and              a  body capable
of gelatinising      in alcohol.          Tho amount of nitrous acid was not
alfected whether alcohol or water was used as the medium                          in which
the alkali was allowed to act on the nitroglycerine.
    A solution of phosphate of                  soda    (Na,2HP04)       acted   on nitro-

                            of Edinburgh, Scsxiun 1882-83.                                                      233
glycerine       ia almost the                 same manner as an alkali, only much less
powerfully.            Chloride               of    sodium had extremely little action,
strong        solutions          of mineral           acids,    as    hydrochloric            and sulphuric
acids,       acted    much           more slowly           than alkalies, and, as was to bo
expected, only a trace of nitrous acid was                                   found amongst                  the pro
ducts of decomposition.                            Contrary      to       the experience of De                 Vrij,
sulphuretted           hydrogen               was     found      to       have       no action on nitro
glycerine when              dissolved           either in ether or in alcohol.                          Alkaline
sulphides,           on the          other hand, acted                very energetically                on nitro
glycerine, and             decomposed it even more powerfully than alkalies.
The stronger           action of the sulphides was especially noticeable when
 a   watery and            not       an alcoholic        solution was allowed to act on the
 nitroglycerine.                Under this condition                      an alkali decomposes                nitro
 glycerine very        slowly, and only after heating for several hours                                         ; an
 alkaline       sulphide decomposes it in almost as many minutes.
       Nitroglycerine            heated        for one hour with alcohol alone                              did not
 exhibit        any signs of decomposition                       ; heated            with water for            three
 hours        it decomposed slowly.
       Some experiments were                        made       to ascertain           the highest possible
  practical      yield of nitroglycerine from                         a   given quantity of glycerine,
     :md the best      proportion             of acids to obtain this yield.                       The highest
     yield was over 95 per                    cent,    of the theoretical yield, and this was
     ubtamed     by adding             1    part of glycerine to                 9   parts of an acid mix
     ture,    consisting of           2    parts      of strong sulphuric               acid      to    1    part of
     fuming     nitric      acid.          The yield       was not improved                  by substituting
     fuming sulphuric                acid for the ordinary strong acid                       ;    and    the yield
     was greatly       lessened            when ordinary strong nitric acid was substi
     tuted for fuming nitric acid.                      The yield was not to any considerable
     extent increased            by allowing the acids to remain in contact with the
     glycerine       for    a    longer period             than five minutes.                     By whatever
     method,     or with whatever proportion                              of acids      the       nitroglycerine
     was prepared,          the products were                  all found to be uniform                       in their
     physical and chemical characters.                          Nitroglycerine           does not therefore
     appear     to be       a    body of variable composition                           as       some       chemists
     assert
              (Hess).           It   is always perfectly colourless, and not yellowish
     m is sometimes             stated.        The yellow colour is probably for the most
      part due   to the nitroglycerine having been washed in the process of
      its   manufacture         with      a   solution of soda, which decomposes it.

    Its solubilities were carefully ascertained, and it was found                   to   be
very slightly soluble in water            ;  largely soluble in ethylic alcohol, but
much more soluble in methylic alcohol                     or methylated     spirit ; and
soluble in every proportion             in ether, chloroform, glacial acetic         acid,
and carbolic acid         ;  freely soluble       in benzol   ;  difficultly soluble     in
carbon disulphide         ;  and practically insoluble in glycerine.
    On account of the constancy observed in the amount of                        nitrous
acid produced when nitroglycerine                  is decomposed by an alkali,         the
author suggests       a method         for estimating      nitroglycerine by     decom
posing it with potash or soda in alcoholic                  solution, and afterwards
determining the amount of nitrous                   acid by means of starch and in
iodide.

      (A full report of this paper appears in the Transactions of the Society.)
     Investigations      have been made by Railton, "Williamson,              Hess    and
 Schwab, Beckerhinn,            and Sauer and Ador for the purpose of              ascer
taining     the elementary composition               and the constitution      of nitro
glycerine.       They all      agree    in regarding it as a nitrate of glyceryl ;
but, whilst some         consider that it is a tri-nitrate, others held that it
 is  a  variable mixture         of the tri-nitrate      with di-nitrate     and mono
 nitrate.      Their analyses       are quite insufficient      to establish either     the
 one    or the other conclusion,              and have mainly been          confined      to
 estimations of the nitrogen.               If  we except a comparative estimation
 of the carbon with the nitrogen, there exist absolutely no determina
 tions of the carbon or of the hydrogen.                     And,    as the decomposi
 tion of nitroglycerine          with potash        has  been    shown    to occur in      a
 manner considerably            different     from that suggested        by Railton and
 Williamson, the main            reason     in support of the constitution of nitro
 glycerine as      a tri-nitrate      has    Wen removed.*         The authors of tb*
  present communication             therefore      believed   that    they were amply
  justified in making         a  fresh and more careful and complete analyst
  of   the    composition       of    nitroglycerine,       Absolut* determinations
  were made, not only of the nitrogen, but also of the carbon and

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1882-83.                               235
hydrogen ; and,         in order    to ascertain the    uniformity in composition
of nitroglycerine,           the nitrogen      of samples prepared          by    various
methods was          estimated.        The nitroglycerine          was both      pure and
thoroughly      dried.       For the determination of the nitrogen, modifica
tions of Dumaa's             method    and of Schloesing's          method were em
ployed        The carbon and hydrogen were estimated by a modification
of   Liebig's method.            Every precaution was taken to insure that tho
results obtained should            be correct      The average of the determina
tions gave      15-91    per cent of carbon, 2-49            per    cent, of   hydrogen,
and     18   05 per cent.         (Dumas)     or 18-14 per cent.        (Schloosing)        of
nitrogen.       Theoretically nitroglycerine,           regarded     as the    tri-nitrate
of glyceryl, contains            15-86 per cent of carbon, 2-20 per cent,                   of
hydrogen, and 18-50 per cent                of nitrogen.     The quantities obtained
by    experiment agree so closely with the theoretical quantities that
they may be regarded              as affording    proof that nitroglycerine           is,   in
reality, the       tri-nitrate of glyceryl.       The authors also conclude, from
the   unvarying        amount      of nitrogen    obtainable       from variously        pro-
pared    specimens of nitroglycerine,            including   one from Nobel's dyna
mite,    that nitroglycerine          is   constant in composition         and does not
contain any        of the lower nitrates of glyceryl, unless very imperfectly
washed.
                                           BUSINESS.
     The President,       at the close of the meeting, gave           a   brief review of
the     Session.      He said there had          been   four Papers on Astronomy,
two     on    Botany,     seven      on Chemistry,         two on Geology,        four      on
Mathematical subjects, six on Meteorology, twenty-three on Natural
Philosophy,         nine on Natural History, three on Philology, two on
Political      Economy, and one on Physiology — sixty-three                      papers     in
all, independently           of the Obituary Notices          which had        been   read.
He thought he was not wrong in saying these papers had combined
an    amount of interest, ability, and novelty which could hardly                           be
excelled, and to         a   very large extent showing         great progress in the
subjects treated         Ho congratulated the Society on having reached
the point at         which they now stood that night.   The Session, he
 believed, had been          a   very successful and    a   very interesting one, and
 the topics        treated of had been of the greatest             possible importance.
 He said,       in opening the Session, that            it   was the 100th Session

 236                   Proceedings of        the  Royal Society
of the Royal Society, and he thought he used                     a  certain amount of
artifice or subterfuge when he made that representation.                         They had
now concluded the 99th Session, and not the 100th.                              Like    other
centenarians, their claims up to this point had not been well-founded,
as the first year      of the century began in November 1783.                       At   that
time the Society was divided into two Classes — the Physical and
the Literary.       The Physical met first on the 4th of November                      1783,
and the Literary on the 17th of the same month.                             They     would,
however, celebrate the commencement of their 100th Session on                             the
first Monday in December.                Referring to the division which              origin
ally existed in the Socioty             as to Physical and Literary            classes, the
President said that some one had suggested                 that they should follow
in the footsteps of their           predecessors,     and have at intervals           purely
literary    papers read in the Society.                The  reason      why that        for  a
Society of that kind scientific researches              were more appropriate             was
that the literary was fluctuating             and stationary, whereas the              scien
tific papers read at their meetings marked the progress of                          science.
Still,  he had an ambition           in some degree or other to resuscitate that
good example        of their forefathers, and accordingly next Session                      he
would invite any of the Fellows of the Society who felt inclined                            to
form   a  Literary     class.     In conclusion, the President said that               at the
commencement of next Session he would review the hundred                               years'
history of their Society.

 and of equations          of   a         higher degree, we observe that in the case of
 a   quadratic the number of terms in (p + q)' is the same as the
 number of different h's represented                                       by [A]jJ~^      •

where A, denotes               the sum of the homogeneous products of roots
of the cubic.           By the            repeated              application of (6) we deduce

1.    Au Essay upon the Limitations in Time of Conscious Sen
       sations. By John B. Haycraft, M.B. Edin., F.R.S.E., &c ;
       Professor of Physiology in the Mason Science College,
          and Lecturer on Physiology                         at Queen's College, Birming
          ham.
     I    propose to describe in this essay some                         experiments            which          I
have conducted            upon          the limits in time of separate                        tactile and
thermal sensibilities.              I   shall endeavour to account for the variations
seen      in the limitations in conscious sensation of the different                                senses;
and also to formulate a general proposition                            as to the effect on con
sciousness of stimuli increasing gradually in rapidity of application.
     If   the finger be touched with a pin, one is both conscious of the
point in time at which the contact is made, and also when it is
broken;        this is likewise true of the other sensations.                             In       the   case
of hearing, for example,                  a note         struck       upon       the pianoforte               is
localised in time as of a certain duration.                              In moving an object
through the field of vision,               it is    seen definitely       to pass into, and also
out of that field.
     There     is,   however,   a   limit to this which               can be determined, for                  if
the image        just alluded to           be      brought — by         means        of   a   revolving
wheel — fifteen or twenty times   second in front of the same point
                                                   a
of the visual field,  will now bo seen as stationary object, and the
                           it                                     a
separate stimuli will produce    continuous sensation.
                                                a        In the case
of hearing, Helmholtz                   has shown  (The Sensation of Tone as <i

observer,       distinguish         132    beats        (produced        by high          notes)         in   a
second     ;   even this being probably not the extreme                          limit        It   is    also
known that over 1400 impacts from                        a   revolving toothed wheel must

 affect     the finger tip in a second,                      before the sonsations are com
 pletely fused in consciousness                   ;   and before it becomes indistinguish
 able from a revolving smooth metal disc.
   It     is,   then, to be noted that stimuli, separate                             in themselves,       are,
when sufficiently           rapid, formulated                in consciousness             as continuous
and      uninterrupted        ;    and    that        this fusion           occurs       sooner in the
consciousness         of   some sensations than                in    others.
   Some experiments                which  I       have lately performed shed,                    I     think,
some      light on         these    facts, and enable us to state them in greater
amplitude        ;   above all indicating where the fusion occurs.                                   I   may
anticipate by stating that this                       is   during the transformation of tho
stimuli into nerve energy.
  My experiments               have been chiefly concerned with the investiga
tion of the          results in consciousness of repeated stimulation                                  of tho
nerves    of tactile and thermal sensibilities, the apparatus being usually
of the    simplest possible kind.
  The skin was stimulated                     interruptedly             in many ways, either by
tuning forks of various degrees of pitch, or by                                  a   revolving toothed
wheel.          The most satisfactory results, however, were obtained by                                    a
vibrating        steel rod fixed in an iron                        vice.        By altering its fixed
point, and therefore the length of the vibrating portion, the period
of its vibrations, and the impacts made upon the finger tip held near
its free end, could be altered at will.                              Its exact pitch was easily
obtained        by attaching to          it   a   light writing style which recorded its
vibrations on         a   revolving smoked cylinder.
  If     the finger be pressed lightly upon                         a   revolving toothed wheel,
whose motion          is   made     to increase slowly in rapidity,                       the following
sensations may be noted.                      When no more than forty or fifty taps
are made upon the finger                 in   a   second,      there       is   produced    a   conscious
ness    of distinct stimuli,             separated           one    from another by periods of
rest       Each stimulus produces                     a    distinct sensation, limited in time
from the one that follows.                    Stimulate more rapidly, and                       it   becomes
no longer possible                 to distinguish             in consciousness             one       stimulus
from another.   They give rise, however, to sensation which we              a
term " roughness," which becomes less marked — less rough — as we
increase the rapidity of the revolving wheel.                                    If, at this point, the
fingers be very gently pressed against the wheel, there                                    is   a   sensation
of tickling — such            as that         produced         by drawing            a   feather over the

248                          Proceedings               of the Royal Society
face.       If,   as a final      step       in the experiment, we                   cause     the wheel            to
revolve very rapidly, the sensation becomes less rough, and, at List,
when as many as 1400 impacts are made upon the finger tip,                                                        the
sensation cannot be distinguished                             from tbat of a revolving toothless
metal disc.         There        is,   in fact,    a   sensation of "smoothness," which, but
for the shearing produced upon the skin, could not be distinguished
                   "
from the " touch     of  stationary smooth metal surface.
                                         a                   We see
then that three distinguishable                              conditions         are produced           by    stimu
lating the skin more and more rapidly.                                       At first,    each stimulation
is   formulated separately in consciousness, then we have                                           a   sensation
of roughness, and finally one of smoothness.
     Before proceeding further                     it       will   be well to insist upon                  the fact,
that      when       we consider              the subject               more generally, we can find
analogous conditions in the other sensations.                                        There    is    certainly in
hearing and sight, for instance,                            a   period of
                                                                          " roughness," which                       is
irritating in its nature, and                     is   a   distinct sensation preceding the                      com
plete fusion of the stimuli in consciousness.                                      Moreover, the nature
of its cause           known only by experience gained from other sensa
                       is
tions   ;   it    not being evident in the consciousness of the special
sensations above mentioned.
     The tick of            a   watch        is   not irritating — on the contrary,                         it   may
produce           hypnotism.               An alarum                with        more     rapidly           repeated
sounds has         a   well known effect,                    upon which           it   will   be needless           to
insist.       My       colleague,          Professor          Poynting,          suggests      that the very
low notes of         a   large organ are, in liko manner, irritating from their
rapid intermittence.    In the numbers quoted from Helmholtz, pro
bably  the " beats
                   "
                     are no longer separately heard, but produce the
harsh dissonance which                       characterises them              ;   a   much lower number
would indicate the number of stimuli which can be heard separately.
This number         I       am unable to state,                    as   a   double syren       is     not    in my
possession.
     Few things          are more annoying than the flickering                                of   a   gas   jet,   or
the slow vibration of                  a   body which gives                 a   blurred unsteady image.
The       tickling of        a   vibrating tuning fork held to the lips, or still
more the          tickling that results from stimulating     in rapid succession
adjacent points              of the        skin,       is    calculated in extreme                 cases    to jjive
excruciating agony.
     A few minutes' consideration will also show that this condition                                                of

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                             249
   "               "
                      is not a sensation of intermittent                           That
      roughness                                                    stimulation.
   this is its     cause    is but a matter of experience aided by the use
   of the other senses.           A child blowing        the sharp edge of    a piece  of
  tissue paper       stretched between its lips, remarks that " it tickles,"
  but     is quite     unaware of the cause of the sensation.                Again, on
  touching the       rapidly revolving wheel, it is conscious only of             a con
  tinuous sensation         ;  but turn      it more slowly,       and   it feels   each
  separate tap.
      We have then in tactile sensibility a condition                 analogous to the
  cause    of dissonance in music, and to the annoying flickering of recur
 rent visual     stimuli       Moreover, we can recognise degrees or qualities
 of   this " roughness,"        a most important       factor in adding to our know
 ledge of the external universe.               On drawing a file, or the edge of a
 fine saw across the ringer, the sensation is quite different from that
 produced      by the back of       a  knife.     Moreover, within limits, we can
 distinguish a coarse from            a  fine file.   The sensation in     each case is
 different,    and experience especially gained by the use of the eye, tells
us    of the nature of the substance which has produced the feeling.
     It  is a well known fact that all parts of the skin are not equally
sensitive.        The skin of the finger-tips            and the front of the hand
can be stimulated           by the impact of        a lighter body than will affect
the    skin of the back of the hand.             Again, the skin of the front of the
arm is more sensitive than that of the dorsal surface, and                   still more
so than the      skin covering the back of the shoulders.               Together with
this difference in actual sensitiveness, the brain is unable to localise
impacts which affect the less                sensitive    parts, so exactly    as those
which        affect     the    more    sensitive.        As   a  result  of this,    two
impacts made on points of the skin near enough may be fused into
one     in consciousness.          If   the points      of a pair of compasses       less
than one millimetre              apart touch the finger-tip        they may bo       dis
tinguished       as two,      the localisation      of each point in consciousness
being very exact.               Over the back, however, the points must be
removed        for more than an inch before they                can be distinguished.
This difference, not to            be discussed here,        is probably    due to the
anatomical distribution of the peripheral nerves.
     It  becomes     an interesting question whether             the limits in time of
conscious tactile sensations vary in like manner over different sur
faces of the body.

250                     Proceedings    of the    Royal Society
    As   a   result of my experiments       I   am led to believe that, whereas
the limitations       in space are widely different,       this  does not hold with
the limitations       in time.
     If  a  rod vibrating about forty times in          a   second be held to          the
finger      tips   or lips,   sensations   of    distinct impacts        may be felt.
Allow the rod to vibrate upon              a   surface less sensitive,        and with
much wider limitations in space, say the skin over the sternum,
and the impacts are still felt as such.                  I   should     mention that,
inasmuch as the skin is less sensitive, the amplitude                    of the     vibra
tions, and therefore the force of the impacts, should be increased.
     So far we have considered the limitation in time of tactile                    sensi
bility    ;  but there remains another very important fnnction of                      the
 skin, which we have to discuss.            I refer   to thermal sensibility.
     On touching       a good conductor, such as an iron ball, any difference
 of temperature will not at          once   bo noted, the cold        will not     be felt
 instantly.        On withdrawing the ball, the sensation of cold                remains
 for   a short time.       The limits in time arc very wide, for the             applica
 tion of the cold body on several              successive    occasions — even         with
 intervals of a second — producing, of course, successive sensations of
 impact, gives rise to a continuous             and uuiform       sensation of cold.
  If  the good conductor be applied            every second to the skin of             the
 back or arm, distinct sensations of cold             will bo produced each time.
 This is not duo to         these parts being covered and sensitive               to cold,
  for the same obtains with the thin skin between the fingers, and the
  back      of   the hand, although      in    a  less  degree.        The    difference
  must alono be due to the variations in thickness of the epidermis —
  a bud conduotor- — which separates           the body touched from the nerve
  end-organs in the lower layers of          the skin.
      In   studying these phenomena,        I   have used a very simple piece of
  apparatus.        A long and slowly vibrating rod         is fixed   in an iron     viee,
  and to its free end      a small glass bottle is attached.       This is fitted with
  a cork, through which passes an iron              rod about half an inch wide.
  The bottle is filled with       a mixture of ice and salts         which cools the
  rod in its whole length.         The portion outside the bottle is caused               to
  impinge upon the finger-tip periodically.
      In order that the action of external stimuli              may affect      oar con
  sciousness,      a certain period of time is necessary.          Tliis period     varies
   with many factors which         we propose to discuss.           A   correct   estima

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84                              251
 tion of the value    of   these factors is   all the   more   necessary,   as they
are    hopelessly confounded in most works on mental science.
    We have, first, the irritation of the peripheral sensitive nerve;
secondly, the transmission of some change thus produced in the
nerve ;    and thirdly, that        effect  produced     upon    centrally   placed
nerve-cells     associated    with the production        of feeling, and     a   con
sciousness    of that feeling.       The time elapsing between         the impact
of   a  body on the hand and the consciousness of that impact is much
less than between the application           of a drop of sugar solution to the
tongue     and the resulting       sensation of sweetness.         This period is
different   in the   case  of each sensation.       On what    does this depend       1
I   shall endeavour       to show that the dependence           is not mainly on
differences    of time taken by the impression to            pass  along different
nerves, nor need we look to differences affecting central cells ; but
we have,     in the nature of the stimulus applied and in that of the
stimulated end-organ, a cause which will account for everything.
    Herbert Spencer, in his Principles of Psychology (vol. i. p. 169,
third edition), would actually distinguish between peripherally
initiated feelings      caused   by internal disturbances — some of which,
he says, are extremely indefinite, and few or none definite               in  a  high
degree    —and     feelings caused      by external     disturbances    which      are
mostly related quite          closely, alike by coexistence and sequence,
among the highest of them the mutual              limitations in time and       space
or both being extremely sharp.             He illustrates this by the fact that
our states     of consciousness in connection with vision and hearing
are more sharply limited         in time and    space than those     in connection
with smell and taste, and, still more, hunger.
     Now, discarding the fact that when considered developmentally
 the retina     at any rate is far more internal           than the mouth         and
 nose, the former        being really a portion        of the brain, the latter
 puckerings-in      of the surface,     I  would    suggest,  that the all-import
  ant factor producing       this difference, is not the brain, or the pro
  duced feelings, as Herbert        Spencer seems to me to indicate, but the
  nature of the peripheral        end-organ stimulated.         If the point of      a
  pin impinges upon the fingertip, the epithelium is depressed,               and at
  the same time the nerves of tactile          sensibility   are stimulated ; and
  on withdrawing        the pin, they are at that moment unstimulated,
   and in   a  condition of resi         Also in the   ear, the sound vibrations

252                  Proceedings    of the Royal Society
travelling rapidly into the internal       ear cause the structures there (the
basilar    membrane and rods of Corti) to vibrate, and — as we are
aware from our knowledge of the action of one vibrating body upon
another — they do this very rapidly.
    Far otherwise with the      senses of smell and taste.         When    odorous
particles pass into the olfactory or upper part of the nasal cavity—
in which the nerves of smell        are placed — it is by     diffusion from    the
lower or respiratory part of the        nose.    If the   breath be held, and      a
piece of incense paper be burnt in front of the face, some time                may
elapse    before the scent is perceived, because the odorous particles
have in fact to diffuse into a closed sac           If, on the other hand,       the
experimenter       "sniffs" the air, the stimulus will          be more rapidly
 perceived, because the odorous particles are carried rapidly through
 the lower     chamber      of the  nose,   inducing out-currents       from     the
 upper chamber, which consequently becomes                immediately    filled by
 odorous particles.       In like  manner, the closed sac has to get rid of
 odorous     particles   from   within    it by this    same    slow   process     of
 diffusion, before the odour ceases to be felt.              From the nature       of
 the stimulation       and position    of the end-organ, the limitations in
 time of the sensations are not well marked.
     In  the case of the sense of taste, the same holds true.          Substances
 held in solution are alone tasted; the tongue is covered with a layer
 of mucin derived from mucous and salivary               glands, and the nerves
  are   not superficial   but embedded in the epithelial covering.                 It
  will  bo  easily understood, that in this case also, the accession of a
  sensation must, from the nature of the stimulus, and the position of
  the end-organ, be gradual in its production and slow in passing off,
  and therefore not strictly limited in           time.     The watery solution
  has to mix in the first place with the mucin covering the tongue
  before it can reach the end-organs situated in the epithelium.
      In  the case of hunger       again, the limitations in time are due
  entirely   to a condition    of things other than mental            The fulness
  of the alimentary canal is associated with          a foeling   of comfort, and
  when no food is present therewith a feeling of hunger             ; and as there
  is every conceivable transition between         a condition of full stomach
  and an empty one, so the passage of the one sensation into the other
  must pass through innumerable transition states.
      If it be needed, another example may bo mentioned in the caso

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84                               253
 of the cold body applied to the horny              tip of the finger, and to the
 thin skin covering the sides.           The nerve-endings          are stimulated by
 the addition       or withdrawal      of heat from the nerves of the skin.
 This is gradual, and does not correspond to the application of the
 cold    body to the surface because of the horny epithelial                  covering.
 Where this covering          is thin, the limitation in time of the sensa
 tion is more definite than where it is thick                ;  and could we apply
 the cold body directly to the nerve end-organ, the                 limits would then
 be  very sharply       defined.     Cover the hand with a glove, and the
limits would be very ill-defined indeed.
    Sufficient     evidence     has,  I    think,   been    adduced to show, that
where      the   limits of    a  sensation are not well defined in time, we
may conclude that this is not due to anything                   in the nature of the
sensorium, but depends upon the way the external energy is changed
into nerve energy       in the terminal end-organ.
    Let me define      a sensation as the result       of  a   transformation    of the
energy     travelling along      a nerve    of sensation from without, into the
energy manifested        by the nerve cell to which it             passes.    We have,
I  insist,    no reason    to   doubt that      if  that nerve       energy travelled
twenty times a second along a nerve of smell, of taste, hearing,
or  of sight,     we should be conscious of twenty separate                  sensations
in each case.
    That such       a transmission     is impossible      in every     case we know,
but    it is due to the fact that in             these cases the nerve cannot be
stimulated from without so frequently.
    In the    case  of the ear, the   limits in time of high notes         are sharper
than those of the low notes, and probably this is due to a better
damping apparatus in the ear.               Could   we increase the perfection       of
this    damping,      the limits of the consciousness in hearing would
probably be sharpened almost indefinitely,                 for we must remember
that the cause of the different sensations of sound is                 a  difference of
pitch, or periods of stimulation           recurrent in time to which the sen
sorium is extremely sensitive.
    If  this be true, the period of time taken by a stimulus to produce
a  sensation      depending      upon    the time taken by its energy to be
transformed into nerve energy             in the peripheral end-organ, will be
some     indication of the manner of this transformation.                For instance,
there is     a very marked interval between the moment at which the

2o4                   Proceedings     of the Boyal Society
rays of light strike the retina, and the production        of the   sensation    ;
and further, the sensation remains for some time after withdrawal
of the stimulus.       It  is unlikely, therefore, that the energy of light
is directly transformed into nerve energy.
    In  shortly    summing      up   the chief   points  alluded to in      this
paper, it may he      stated —
    (1) That stimuli applied to sensitive peripheral         end-organs with
increasing frequency, produce at first consciousness of the separate
stimuli   ;  then, their individual characters are lost, and a disagreeable
sensation — " roughness" in the case of tactile feeling        — is produced;
and lastly, we feel a sensation indistinguishable          from a constantly
applied stimulus.
    (2) For the development of nerve energy from external stimuli
in a sensory nerve a latent period is necessary, and it elapses be
tween the application         of the stimulus and the resultant       effect on
the nerve.       On withdrawing the stimulus, the nerve is still in             a
condition      of activity, and remains so for a certain period          (after-
period).      When this nervous energy is transformed into nerve-cell
energy in the sensory centres,           there is probably    neither a well-
 marked latent nor an after-period.
    (3) When, as in the sense of touch, the consciousness of the
 stimulus corresponds more exactly in time with the application of
 the stimulus     than in the sense of sight, we are to look not to any
differences in the limitation of consciousness itself, but to the time
elapsing in each case before the nerve is excited by the stimulus
and the length of the corresponding after-period.
         2.   The Old English Mile.          By Wm. Flinders Petrie.
             Communicated by Professor Robertson Smith.
    The length of the old English mile has been hitherto so uncertain,
 that any fresh light upon it is well worthy of study ; and an im
portant source of information
                                     — tho map in the Bodleian Library —
has not yet been brought to bear upon the question.               The present
 inquiry was     suggested    by the sight of this map, which seems to add
 so much to our knowledge          that a review of the whole subject has
 become     desirable.    It  is proposed, therefore, in this paper to bring
 together all the data worth        consideration, beginning with the most

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                          255
recent ; and by deducing          what the mean conclusion         is from each
source, to be thus able to compare together the various results, and
 so arrive    at some      definite    statements    within known limits of
 uncertainty.
    The only discussion of the subject that has yet been made is that
by Professor      de   Morgan
                                  * in the article     " Mile," in the Penny
 Cyclopaedia   ; in other   encyclopaedias     no notice is taken of the history
of the English mile, and D'Anville              makes only    a rough deduction
as to  the old mde being longer than the statute mile              ; he uses   but
few data, complicates these         with unproved theories, and is somewhat
vague    in hia statements, t
    It will  be necessary     first to briefly mention some of the conclu
sions   in De Morgan's most valuable article in order to point out
their bearing on the inquiry.             In  beginning    the article he seems
strongly inclined       to disbelieve      in the existence of any old mile
longer than the statute mile, mainly relying on the fact of Bernard
(1688) and Greaves (1647) not describing any longer mile.                      He
says,
       "  on the authority of the silence of Bernard and Greaves above
referred to, we must remain of a contrary opinion (i.e., to D'Anville),
and must      suppose that the computed miles preserved by Ogilby
(1675) had been intended to represent the number of statute miles,
but erroneously given.            What then may these computed miles
mean    which had served the common purpose in the estimation of
distances?      The word computed never meant reputed, but was
always applied to a result of reckoning               of  some   kind or other."
Now it     so happens that,      in the Traveller's Guide (1699) |        (a typo
graphical     edition of Ogilby's          Atlas), these    miles  are  variously
described as "computed," "vulgar               computation,"    and  "reputed;"
so that the objection       raised by De Morgan         to their being those    in
common repute and use is not borne out by the name employed.
He notices Ogilby's guess that the computed distances read a less
number by omitting the lengths of the towns                 ; and, rejecting that
idea as an insufficient explanation (as it certainly is), ho concludes
   *  Notes and Queries,  i. xii. 195.
   t As when he describes 15-2 miles as being " quelque chose de plus que 14,"
 in Misures Itineraires, cbap. x.
    \ De Morgan does not seem to have seen this book at all, as he refers to The
 Complete Tradesman, by N. H. (1684), as giving the lists of computed and
 measured miles, which this edition of Ogilby gives far more completely.

 256                   Proceedings    of the Royal    Society
that the    " computed " distances were derived from the straight-line
measurements of statute miles from a map, thus omitting the length
of windings of the         roads.    But this explanation      also is quite in
sufficient, as, in the first place,       the windings   will not account for
even as much as half of the difference of numbers of computed or
reputed and statute miles          ; secondly,   the difference between com
puted and statute miles exists just as plainly on the straight Roman
roads, where no      windings exist,    as on the  winding roads    ; and  finally,
as we    shall  see, these computed miles are the same as those          in  use in
the thirteenth century, when maps were very scarce, and it is quite
unlikely     that    the populace      should   have   adopted     their current
reckoning      of every-day journeys       from the measurements of a few
distorted monastic manuscripts.             Hence, De Morgan's        explanation
is certainly     insufficient; and in the latter part of his article he
argues    for an old mile equal to         li statute miles, concluding thus :
" We think it by no         means improbable that 100 ancient miles are as
much as 150 statute miles, and tolerably certain that they exceeded
145 such miles."         Thus   he agrees   with Sir Henry Ellis, who writes,
 " the ordinary mile of England                   was nearly a mile and a      half
of the present standard."*
     A point   on which De Morgan lays much stress is the shortening              of
the roads in modern times, and the much greater length he supposes
them to have formerly been.             The only evidence adduced is        a com
parison of four of the distances by Ogilby (1675) in statute miles
with modern statements of the same, which may not have followed
exactly the same route.           But on measuring the modern distances            t
of about ninety of Ogilby's statements, there does not appear to bo
any constant difference between his reckoning and the present roads ;
and in single lengths Ogilby was certainly in error occasionally, since
 lie sometimes gives a less distance than the shortest practicable line. {

      Introduction to Domesday Book (1833), i. 145 et srq.
    t The actual distances in statute miles are here ascertained from the county
 maps of The National Gazeteer (1865 ?); these arc very clear, and appear to he
 accurate on comparison with the Ordnance Survey.       The windings of the roods
 are in all cases carefully attended to in the measurement.

 manifestly ancient course of most of them, it seems very unlikely
 that any notable alteration has taken place                in their length since they
 were the first tracks through waste lands.
     After what has         been     remarked above, there does not seem any
reason for not taking            the statements       of distances in various books
and maps to be what they profess                  to be, that is, the     "reputed" or
 "vulgar"        long     miles between the places             in question, reckoned
exactly      like    the statements          of   the same      distances      in  statute
miles.
     It  may seem rather astonishing              to see   in all   maps,    until within
recent years, such a careful definition                 of miles as     "  statute  miles,
694 to 1°      "; but the      need for this explicitness arose from the great
confusion        which existed between different                 miles.      In Gibson's
edition of Camden (1695) there are no less than three mile scales
on nearly all the maps; these scales vary a good deal, but by
measuring each of them, and                a  distance between two places on each
map to give         the true scale, the values of the three miles, " great,"
" middle,"        and " small," may be deduced. * On thus obtaining
a   value from each of the forty or more maps, and taking the mean
result for each sort of mile, we find the miles to be respectively
1290     ±16,      1167 ±14,        and 1037 ±11        thousandths      of the statute
mile,    f    Now     these values are very exactly          in the proportion of       10,
9,   and 8    ;l   and since we cannot doubt but that 1037 was intended
for the statute mile of          8  furlongs, it seems that these three miles wero
of 10, 9, and        8  furlongs respectively.
     Next     before     this there is       the great    authority     of    Ogilby,  the
surveyor of England,               to whom the first accurate           road maps      and
measurements          are due.       He published his atlas, Itinerarium Anglice,
                                           "                         "
in 1675,      stating the miles of horizontal distance {i.e., as the crow
 flies),   of "vulgar computation" (i.e., the old long miles), and of
 " dimensuration "
                           (i.e., the statute miles measured by his perambula-
     *
        The degrees on the borders of the maps cannot be trusted, as they bear
 no fixed relation to the miles, and the longitudes of the western counties are
 very erroneous.

sought in the typographical edition of his work called Tlie Traveller'*
 Guide (1699).*          For comparing the "computation," "vulgar com
putation,"     or   "reputed" miles, with the real distances, Ogilby's
statute   miles have been here adopted, as he has no constant error in
one direction, and his fluctuating errors are much less than those of
the reputed miles,        so  that no further inaccuracy           will   be caused by
taking his statement.           In this investigation the           roads were broken
up into lengths of about               forty miles each for purposes            of    com
parison of the mile lengths             ;   and besides      this, there are shorter
lengths of cross roads.          The lengths compared together are in all               154
in number, of which 134 belong to the old mile, eight to the Jf.'W.
mile, and twelve to the Welsh mile.                   From the mean of these           134
lengths, the old mile appears as 1307                ± 5.   The local miles we         pass
over for the present;          but the posting miles which are given, though
agreeing    in general with the old miles, yet in nine cases are shorter,
and in two cases       a  little longer    ; the    shortest form is equal to           the
statute mile.
   From      Ogilby's     work    lists of miles were reprinted more or                less
abbreviated, as in the The Complete                 Tradesman, by N. H. (1684),
which      gives     both     "computed"           and    "measured"        miles.        In
 The Kraef Dealer, by             J.  H. [John Hill] (1688), the               miles     are
generally the reputed or long miles of Ogilby, but sometimes                            the

before    Ogilby's     publication,       the miles are       the same as the post
miles in Ogilby,           where they        differ    occasionally     from    Ogilby's
reputed    miles.
    The next earlier information                is in the maps of England             com
 monly known as         "The Quartermaster's Map" (1644).                    This   gives
 a scale on each      of the six sheets      ;   and on measuring two distances
 on each sheet       to obtain the absolute value,             it  appears   that    these
maps     are  far more accurate           than any others of that period,                the
average error being but a third of that of Saxton, Speed, or Gibson.
The mile value from this source averages 1255                   ± 10.

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                              259
(1613)*      first appeared; this consists of a series of small copper
plate maps of each county             with     a   cross-line table of the distances
between places        in the county, besides         a    similar plate of all England.
The same plates were printed                from again      by the same publisher                     in
A Book of the Names            of all Parishes, &c. (1662            and 1668).               Taking
from each plate two of the distances stated between                               places    in miles,
and      comparing the 73 distances           thus extracted with the true road
distances, the mean mile is 1375 ±12.                       But this             is so decidedly
longer than the mean mile of any other authority,                                that it seems         as
if these distances had been compiled and tabulated by measurement
from the plates, or from some older maps,                    in straight           lines.      If    this
were the case we       should subtract about          7   per cent.,         f and the      true mile
will then be 1280       ± 20,   and thus in accordance with other authorities.
  Speed's      maps of counties preceded                  thi3 by some              time (1610);
and on      measuring the mile scale, and a distance between                               towns, on
each     plate, and then taking the mean of the 43 results, the inilo
comes      out 1300    ± 12,    omitting the Welsh counties.
   Saxton's county maps (1575) also have scales, and were examined
like Speed's for extracting the mile. From thirty plates the mean
result is 1310 ± 16, omitting the              Welsh      as before.
     William of Worcester (1473) gives                   measurements               and distances
continually, throughout his rambling note-book                          ;    and    by extracting
all the distances, his mean           mile may be obtained.                        But it is not
desirable to include any of less than 5 miles, as such are necessarily
much less accurate, being only stated                    to single miles ; and                 all    sea
distances, and        rough statements         of the dimensions of districts or
countries,     should    be omitted.           There then remain 92                         distances,
and on measuring all             these      on modern        maps,          it   appears     that his
mile was 1310 ±20.

therefore probably about 1280 ± 20.

  ±   60,* plus about         7 per cent,   for windings,     =    1320    ±   60.    Neither
 this nor the previous statement are worth much, as they depend on
 the estimates of a few foreigners in a strange                    country, and not on
 the well-known           reckoning of places where tho writers and all their
 acquaintance had always lived, as in England.
      We now       come      to what is the oldest authority, and also one                  of
 the most complete.              This is the vellum map of England, Wales,
 and Scotland,          in the Bodleian Library, which has the roads and
 distances marked on it throughout England and Wales.                               This map
 is attributed to the thirteenth century, and is by far the finest map
 known for such           an early period.      It  is written       in  red    with brown
lines, and with tho sea coloured green ; and                     it is in very fair con
 dition.      It was published in copper-plate facsimile by Basine, with
a partial description by Gough (to whom it belonged) in British
 Topography, i. 76          1  (1780).    It  has also been published           in coloured
facsimile, with         a  key-plate of the names printed, in National Monu
 ments     of Scotland, part iii., edited by C. Innes.                    Basine omitted
things     altogether when he could               not easily read         them, and        his
renderings often differ from Gough's account.                        Generally his map
has a better reading than Gough's               text  ; but they both have many
errors.]:       Gough         continually    omitted    the numerals, even              when
Basine read them rightly             ;  and he made       curious       mistakes in tho
places. §      Of    course, no attempt was made           to utilise the distance         in
such    a  manner of treatment.            The facsimile by C. Innes is                a fine
piece     of work,        and    apparently    very correct    ;   but the names          are
often omitted          from the key-plate       if hard to        read  ;  no attempt       is
made to supply lost names,               by considering     the     positions of places       :
and the words have been merely read,                 as  well as might be,           without
a reference        to a modern map           to check the reading.           ||    The main

 attention of the editor was given (very properly in such                    a  work) to
 the Scotch topography, and the far more valuable part of the map
 — as   a map— was treated          as an annex of         little importance       to the
 subject in hand.         No attempt      to transcribe         or examine the mile
 distances was made either by Innes or by Gough.
     "When    I saw  this map       at Oxford,    and transcribed as well             as I
 could * in an hour or two the lists of distances, it seemed very evi
 dent that all the distances in the south and east of England had
 been rewritten by some hand well accustomed                      to mediaeval    script   ;
and this accounts for the          ends of many words going off into a mere
series of strokes, since the rewriter was not certain of part of the
name,     and just inked         over what he could             see.    This rewriting
deserves careful study in considering              the map         ; and  as it was    ap
parently done before the sixteenth               century, and the old writing
must have       been fading then, and yet is not illegible               in parts even
now, it is     some evidence as to the great age of the map.                    What is
now much        needed    is a critical  examination of this map, identifying
all the     places  by comparison with modern                  maps,   and recovering
any    traces of the first     writing of   names and distances where              it  ha3
¦become    all but illegible.        This work    needs       a   good   palaeographer;
hut for    the question of the miles, which is what we have at present
to consider, such        care   is not required     ;   for,   if  a few doubtful dis
tances are omitted, it will not perceptibly affect our results.                     From
a comparison of the readings of Basine, Gough, Innes, and my own
notes, the distances may be pretty safely settled in all legible cases                    ;
and after omitting           those  in Wales and Cheshire, which                 show a
different     mile, there are 130 distances available                for examination.
The mean value of the old mile from              these is 1265 ± 9.
    Having now described the various data available for fixing the
old mile, we will       place the results all together and compare              them, in
terms of thousandths of the statute mile               ;  stating the mean          result
from each source, the probable error           ( ±, i.e., what amount of varia
tion the truth is          as  likely to   exceed     as    to   lie within), and the
average    error of   a  single length, which shows the relative accuracy
of the different     sources.

      The question now before                us        is,   what probability        is      there of any
change       in the popular mile during the four centuries in which                                          we
have traced       it?    The possibility of change certainly                                   lies within
narrow limits, since (looking                     to the accurate            authorities)           the    later
examples cannot be taken to exceed 1307, nor the earlier to                                                 fall
short of 1265.*              Now,                 very unlikely that the Bodleian mile
                                            it is
                                       it
was as long      as 1300,     in fact               is   more than 100 to        1   against its being
so;     therefore, the oldest form cannot be taken                              as   a       mere    careless
variant of Ogilby's value of 1307.                             Bacon, Lannoy, and William of
Worcester are all too uncertain to decide on the difference in ques
tion.       Coming down to the seventeenth century, the Quartermaster's
maps,       which    agree    very well                among themselves,             corroborate the
earlier value, but we can hardly set them up against the large mass
of information in Ogilby's tables.
      On the whole,   I      should incline to fix the value of the old                              English
mile at 1300 ±10 during the end of the fifteenth and on to the seven
teenth centuries, and to suppose that during the fourteenth century
and the beginning of the fifteenth,                          it   was lengthening from              a     value
of 1265      ± 10,   which    it      had in the thirteenth                  century.          As    it    had
lengthened thus,        it   is   not improbable that the original value of                           it   was
still shorter, perhaps not exceeding                         1250, or   J1   statute miles.In any
case the range       of uncertainty               is   now reduced to          very narrow limits,

Lancashire        is   1400        in Saxton, but              comes down to the usual old mile
in Speed         and Ogilby.                Thus    it     seems that the old                  N.W. mile          was
about 1560 + 80, and                    was somewhat assimilated, as time went on,
to the       usual old mile of England,                            1300 ±10.            There are not suf
ficient accurate             data to allow of           a   complete           disentanglement of local
miles   ;    but the Bodleian               map distances               in the eastern counties are
not over the average, while later on they are higher.                                            The southern
and S.W. counties generally have                               a    lower mile than the northern.
But there       is   nothing necessarily to show more than accidental varia
tion in the unit, except in the                           N.W.          counties,           considered        above,

264                   Proceedings       of the  Royal Society
    First   we must note that the statute mile and furlong were prob-
ably independent of each other originally.                  The earliest mile near
the statute mile was one of 5000 feet, defined as                         furlongs    3
perches     and 2 palms,* about 1350 ad.                 Then about 1470 a.d. a
mile appears of 8 furlongs,*           which first received legal recognition
in  1593 A.D.t      Now,      if the mile of    8 furlongs had always existed,
it iB very unlikely that one containing            a   fractional   number of far-
longs would      have arisen, so that it is probable that the furlong is
the older measure, and that the mile was adapted to fit                     it    And
this is also indicated          by the register of Battle Abbey mentioning
furlongs but not miles ; so that the furlong appears a long time
before the mile of 8 furlongs.
    The furlong, though now defined by the yard standard,                     was  ori
ginally independent of the present foot and yard; for it is im
possible to suppose      a   length of   5 J  yards being selected without any
reason.      This is manifestly the nearest translation              into the lesser
standards of a measure which was originally incommensurable                      with
them.
    Thus it    seems    most likely (as De Morgan supposes) that the
statute mile was originally 5000 feet of 12 inches, and that it was
modified to 5280 feet            in order    to agree      with the furlong, with
which — as being the nearest measure in              size, and the basis of       land
measurement — it was most required to                 accord.     And the furlong
was an independent            unit, not having       any exact relation to tire
foot of 12 inches, or the mile of 5000 feet.
    Now we have         seen     by Gibson's    maps      that the long mile was
evidently reckoned        as 10    furlongs, being exactly        y  of the statute
mile there     ; and we have seen            that the old mile was originally
 1-265*     10 statute miles, or even        slightly   less.  The furlong, then,
would be '1265 statute mile, =8015 ±64 inches, or rather less.
The chain, or     ^    of the furlong, would be 801 '5         ± 6 inches.     Below
\  of  a chain, or   a perch, we lose sight of the original subdivisions,
us the    link is  a   modern invention         of land surveyors, and the           5i
yards is merely an approximate adaptation of a different standard.
    Turning now to other countries, we meet at onco with a mile

  closely similar       to the old English mile                  ;  this     is the old French
  mile,  which is equal          to 1*21 statute miles, or               within      3     per cent, of
 what we have seen to he probably the earliest English mile.                                       And
 this resemblance is not only in length, hut also in subdivision, as
 the  French mile is 1000              toises, and this is decimally divided                        like
 the    10 furlongs       in the mile, and               the   10 chains          in the       furlong.
 Also, the English league consisted of two old English miles,* like
 the  French      league.
    This continued decimal division of the French mile                                  suggests that
perhaps the old English mile may have had lesser subdivisions than
the chain ; -j^ of the chain would be 80'15 ± -6 inches                                  ;  and if this
fathom was subdivided into                   6 feet,     like the French         toise, wo should
have      a  foot of      13vS6 ± -1        inches,        or rather less perhaps by the
original mile.
    Now, on referring             to Inductive Metrology, p. 107,                   it will     be seen
that the commonest foot known in the mediaeval                                   remains in Eng
land is 13-22 ±-0l              inches in length; this being moro commonly
found even than our modern foot of 12                            0    inches.       Here then wo
have found the basis of the old mile appearing quite independently
as  the most frequent measure in mediaeval                          England.            This foot     ap
pears to be the same as the             classical " Drusian foot," which may                       have
been introduced          by the Romans into both France and England.
    The    series of measures          thus connected            with the old English mile
run thus : —
                           Inches (by the mile).                   Inches (by the foot).
    Foot        .    .      .   13-36+          -1          or          1322+         -01
  6 feet=l    fathom       .    80-15+         -6                       79 32±         06
10 fathoms =1 chain         .801-5+          6'    statute miles.      793-2   ±       -6 statute miles.
10  chains=l furlong          8015-   +    60-=      -1265+-001      7932-    ±    6'= -1252±O001.
 10 furlongs =1 mile       80150'    ±    600 =1-265       ±'01    79320-     ±   60 =1-252      ±-001.
    The    second determination, working from the foot, which is far more
accurately known than the mile, is probably the most trustworthy                                         ;
 and as we have observed                 that the original              form of the mile was
 probably rather shorter than                 1  -265, therefore this restoration of the
 old mile from the foot, shown by various buildings, represents the
 data that we have as            well   as   anything        can, and is far more accurato
 than anything that we can hope to recover                          from itinerary measures.

266                  Proceedings       of the Royal Society
    We   see, then, that by the exclusive survival of the 12-inch foot,
we have lost the basis of a decimal system of measures,                 and thus,
complicated our land measure in            a most    troublesome manner.
    In this examination,      then, we have        traced   the old English mile
back through four centuries,          and seen that it varied but         little in
different times, and      as used     by different persons.        And, following
the analogy of the old French             mile (with which it seems to have
been    identical), we    see   that it was part of the decimal system of
the fathom, chain, furlong, and             mile, based upon the most usual
mediaeval foot of England.            Whether     this mile was introduced       by
the Normans, or whether its basis             had    remained in England      (like
other measures) from Roman times, is still unsettled ; and this
question, as well as the local variations of the mile, and the origin
of the miles of Wales and Cheshire, must remain for future discus
sion, when other and more complete             materials may be discovered.

Vast though is the literature of vegetable              and   animal morphology,
it becomes      more   readily grasped       than that perhaps       of any other
science, when we classify        it in relation   to the few great works    which
initiated and for ever mark the successive waves of advance.                 Thus
of the early pre-morphological or encyclopaedic             stage, when materials
were being little more       than heaped together,         the works of  Pliny or
Gesner may be taken         as types,   to which the other encyclopaedias        of
Natural History by Joneton, &c, furnish at first mere supplements.
The Systema Naturae of Linnaeus closes the old and marks a new
era,  and initiates that systematic        enumeration of the flora and fauna
of the globe which has since made such vast progress.                   All subse
quent systematic     literature, no matter how important, no matter how
much exceeding      in quantity of new forms, involves no essential, no

the fundamental classic               of Linnwus.           Similarly all works of detailed
anatomical           research    united with exact comparison and clear gene
ralisation, are in botany simply                      to be regarded as supplementary

an intellectual           heir of Vesalius.              Embryological             literature      in like
manner            finds   its place in the appendix                   and commentary to the
works of Robert Brown or Von Baer respectively;                                          at the head of
all investigations           of serial homologies stands Goethe's memorable
essay        On     the   Metamorphoses             of Plants; while all evolutionary
literature may be arranged round the works of Lamarck and Darwin.
The morphological                investigator,        unless        claiming           to initiate    some
new          line of thought,         has    ihus to take his                 place       simply      as an
assistant to one or more of a few immortal masters.
     But the cell theory?               This is apt         to be excluded                 from general
morphology altogether, and to have a separate                                subordinate province
— of histology — erected for                  it, a      vicious tendency, which although
by       no means fully adopted,             still somewhat injures the continuity of
treatment in the writer's recent essay on Morphology.*                                          To    ascer
tain its position, we must first briefly glance at its history.
     Here the fundamental               classic     is   undoubtedly           the Anatomie Gene-

organism into definite structural                     components             is,   however, the main
idea     ;   after this the history of histology               is   little   more than of accumu
lating observations with improving optical and technical appliances,
until we          come to Schleiden, who             boldly referred all               vegetable     tissues
to the cellular           type, and the plant embryo to                            a   single nucleated
cell     ; while Schwann, by immediately extending the generalisation
to       the animal world, fully constituted the cell theory. This idea
then         is   fundamental      in morphology;              for the innumerable species

structure.          It    is    not necessary to do more than merely allude to
such applications of the cell theory, or to that of the study of patho
logical      structure initiated              by    Goodsir         and Virchow,           or to that
brilliant confirmation of                the unity of the animal and vegetable                        cell
which has lately been afforded by the detailed study of the processes
of cell multiplication.                 Agassiz*        was    fully justified in          the opinion
that the most brilliant result of modern science was the ovum-theory,
and      thus it is beyond dispute that " in our own day, as in those
of Bichat and Schwann, the labours of the histologist, when inspired

cellular    unit, however valuable, yet throws no light upon a largo
number      of problems at present under dispute          ; and it is the aim of
the present paper      to draw attention to some of these, and by the
aid of a re-statement of the cell theory (a new appendix              as  it  wore
to the    Anatomie Generate, or to the work of Schwann), to propose               a
solution of them.
    The problems then      which it   is proposed     to discuss  may be briefly
enumerated      for convenience under      separate heads, as follows      : —
    (1) The classification and affinities of the Protozoa.
    (2)   The classification and affinities of     the Protophytes.
    (3) The     systematic   position    of    the Myxomycetes        and     other
peculiar forms.
    (4) The acceptance      or rejection of Hseckel's third intermediate
sub-kingdom Protista.
    (5) The     phylogeny   of the lower plants and animals, and their
origin from one or several stocks.
    (6) The relation of the Protophytes          to the higher plants.
    (7) The relation of the Protozoa to the higher animals.
    (8) The morphological relations of plants to animals and their
origin from a common        stock, or from separate ones.
    (9)   The classification of animal     tissues.
    (10) The physiological rationale of changes of cell-form.
     (11) A theory of the origin of sexual reproduction, and its relation
to conjugation and other cases        of cell union.
     (12)  The relation between normal and pathological tissues.
     (13)  The influence of the environment on the origin of organic
 forms.
     (14)  A  theory of cellular variation (since the theory of descent
 involves a theory of variation, and all variations, normal and patho
 logical alike) must ultimately be expressible         in terms of cellular ones.

         Classification and Affinities of the Protozoa.- The Protozoa
 have    long been thrown into a few main groups, of which the Rhizo-
 poda, embracing all essentially amoeboid           forms like the Protoplasta,
  Foraminifera, Heliozoa, and Radiolaria, and the Infusoria, including
  all those  of permanent and usually ciliated         type, are the oldest and
  most important.       The position of the Gregarinida, of the Monads,
  and still more of forms     like Cldamydomyxa and          the Labyrinthulida,

 270                      Proceedings        of the Royal Society
or Haeckel's       Protomyxa, is still disputed, nor is that of Rhizopods                to
Infusors, despite their more or less intermediate forms,                  as yet settled.
    But our current conceptions of the groups of Protista                      are   based
upon their more              prominent and permanent characters               only.    An
infusorian       is constantly thought of as a permanently ciliated                      or
flagellate    organism ; a radiolarian is constantly described as a                 highly
differentiated rhizopod, with two layers of protoplasm, a gelatinous
envelope,      yellow cells,        and    siliceous skeleton  ;  or again its simpler
ally the heliozoon is seldom or never thought of without its radiat
ing pseudopodia with their peculiar axial filaments.
    Yet    such conceptions involve a morphological                fallacy of the most
serious kind.          These are indeed the most highly differentiated, the
most frequent, the most permanent,                  and therefore the most striking
forms in which these organisms are known to us, but of late years
it has been becoming more and more obvious that each of these                        well-
known forms is at best but the most important stage of a life-history,
during which the organism                 passes through one or more other phases
of form, which may indeed be transitory, but thereby lose no                         whit
of their morphological distinctness or importance.
    Thus,     thanks        to   the researches      of  Dallinger and         Drysdale,
Lutschli, Savile Kent,             and others,* we know that a monad is              not a
permanently flagellate form, but appears                   at one time encysted,        at
another becomes             amoeboid    ;  the ciliated   embryos      of the Acinetae
have long been          known,! while         more recent investigations have estab
lished the multiplication of radiolarians by zoopores,                 J or the frequent
union of several individuals                of various species of Heliozoa§ or of
Gregarines      []  into    a  single mass.       In short, the progress of recent
research among these forms has largely lain                  in revealing the exist
ence   in   even the most highly differentiated forms of a life-cycle                   of
several distinct phases.
   In lower forms           more attention is paid to the whole life-cycle,            yet
not. sufficiently       so.     The Amojba is still constantly spoken of as              if
its encysted         stage     were   of no morphological        interest, whereas      no
permanently amoeboid                form has ever been proved by continuous

observation to exist           ;    in the Gregarine, on the other hand, the
amoeboid state          is often practically ignored by classifiers.
   In    the remarkable Protomyxa                   of Haeckel, however, we have an
organism in        which     several       phases    of form are almost equally pro
minent, so that its description as an amoeboid, or a ciliated or as an
encysted        organism, has been alike impossible.                     For   here       is no per
manent       highly differentiated form              ;   but an eventful life-history                    in
which one protean mass of protoplasm                            passes   through a cycle of
several     distinct     phases.       Let   us carefully examine then these phases,
since    light may thus be thrown upon the life-histories of the higher
Protozoa already referred to.
  Starting then from the encysted stage, in which a mass of proto
plasm     is surrounded            by a dense envelope,            we find that from this
after atime (in which division of the protoplasm has in this case
occurred), there issues a swarm of somewhat pear-shaped, naked,
motile, flagellate organisms.                    After   a   brief period of active locomo
tion, these        lose their flagellum             and their         permanent form alike,
extrude       pseudopodia,          in short, melt down into                   amoebae.               After
some    period of amoeboid life they flow together into a single proto
plasmic mass — unite               into a plasmodiuro,           as   it is    termed,          and this
after another       brief but remarkable period of locomotion and pseudo
podia!      activity, settles down into a spheroidal mas6 ; this re-encysts
itself, and the whole cycle commences                         anew (Plate      IV.       fig.    1).
  If    now we make          a     diagrammatic representation of this life-history
(or rather form-hintory,              as    it   should more accurately be termed), of
Protomyxa,             exhibiting (1) the encysted, (2) the ciliated,                            (3) the
amceboid, and (4) the plasmodial stages, we shall find that                                     all    those
temporary phases of form observed among the higher Protozoa may
at once be referred to one or other of these (figs.                           3,   8).      If    this be
so, those       curious phenomena of the exhibition of ciliated forms by
organisms         usually of amceboid             type like the Radiolarians, or of amce
boid forms by organisms almost permanently encysted or motile, like
Gregarines or Monads respectively, lose their anomaly, and come
under       a    generalisation        at    once        simple and comprehensive, viz.,
that    a   form-history      essentially similar to that of Protomyxa (with
blanks       it   is    true, but blanks which the progress of discovery                                  is
constantly         filling   up,     and may not unlikely almost wholly fill),
may be sketched out                for all the higher Protozoa.                    The same idea

  272                      Proceedings        of the   Royal Society
  may be better         expressed      in   the statement       that the higher Protozoa
  may     be regarded       as  organisms of fundamentally Protomyxoid                  form-
  history, in which, however, some one phase has attained compara
 tively high specialisation and differentiation, together with relatively
 greater permanence.             Or the same idea may be stated in the exactly
  converse       way,    that the Protozoa may be viewed as organisms of
 fundamentally          Protomyxoid          form-history,      in which, however,        one,
 two, or three        of the     phases      become       abbreviated into merely           em
 bryonic ones, or may even (by that shortening of development with
 which embryologists are so familiar in the higher organism)                         become
 completely suppressed.
      Thus     then,   if illustration       be   needed,     a  Heliozoon    differs    from
 Trotomyxa          merely * in      the higher differentiation         and relative       per
 manence        of the amoeboid phase of its life-cycle, since more or                     less
 brief encysted, ciliated, and plasmodial phases have all been observed.
 The more specialised           but kindred        Radiolarian      seems to have lost its
 plasmodial         phase ;    so too,     perhaps,     has the monad, while          in   the
 Gregarine only the ciliated state is wanting.
      2.  Affinities    of   the    Protophyta.     — Passing now          to the    second
 problem proposed            at the outset, that of the affinities of the Proto-
 phytcs, the same conception may be at once applied.                            Too much
 importance is here attached to the encysted                     phase, for the life-cycle
is clearly apparent in many forms.                     Treviranus, in 1811, made           the
notable discovery that the spores of Conferva?                     move  like Infusoria, f
Many years later Unger described the same                      phenomena in Vaucheria
clavala,      as
                   " the plant in the moment of transition to the animal,"*
while Von Siebold and others                    argued     against this essentially just
view, with more ingenuity                 than   soundness.        The wide prevalence
of this change          is constantly being confirmed.                Not only    have we
a   thoroughly        well-defined and constant cycle between                 the resting
and the ciliated state, but we may fairly reckon the brief phase of
inactivity,       which   so   often is observable between the loss of cilia              and
the return to the encysted state (when the organism closely resembles

       The possession or non-possession of a nucleus is of course immaterial, so
fur as ths form-history is concerned.

 a   contracted amoeba), as representing the amoeboid                                form.    A distinct
 assumption        of the amoeboid state at the close of the ciliated one, is
 sometimes        to be observed,           — as lately by Reinke* in Bangia.                         And
 thus the cycle        is complete,          save only for the plasmodial phase.
     The importance           of this view for the Protophytes then, is scarcely
less      than for the Protozoa.                 With    a tendency of the encysted state to
predominance, more marked even than in the                                       Gregarines, the other
phases are        by no means obliterated, and we thus — and only thus —
obtain an      intelligible explanation of that alternation between the
resting      and the motile phase which is so frequent and so charac
teristic.      The inevitable               applicability       of this          to classification,   and
the light     it yields, will      be sufficiently obvious.                      Without prematurely
proposing a detailed classification,                      it will       be obvious        that we must
regard those       forms, which like Torula, exhibit only the resting state,
not as      primitive, but as exceedingly specialised, and those which
exhibit more and more of the cycle as less so.
     3.   Affinities    of    the Myxomyceles.             — Passing             to the Myxomyeetei,
it will at once be evident, that unless the present theory can be
entirely overturned, they have no place                               among the fungi proper —
where       it is the encysted          phase that predominates,                      the others being
greatly reduced or suppressed                        ;   but are in fact morphologically               as
remote      from these as are the monads.                            The Myxomycetes             must be
placed next         Protomyxa           ;    in fact, Protomyxa                   is simply     the least
differentiated         known Myxomycete.                       Their higher forms            are interest
ing —first, in very frequently showing                           less of the ciliated stage, and
secondly (a more important                         character^ since here              they are unique
among        living beings), in affording                      an enormous differentiation              of
their plasmodial stage             ;    the complicated forms which many of them
exhibit being simply those of their plasmodial froth, to which per
manent shape is then given by the formation of a cellulose envelope.
The resemblance             to fungi is thus as purely superficial and adaptive
             for instance, of Hydroids to Polyzoa, and, like
                                                                                          it,
as that,                                                                                  is    of physio
logical interest alone.

three main reasons,           — of which the first              is   that the proposal seems only
to double the difficulty,                   since    it   does       not enable us to distinguish

second, closely related to the first, that      Protista   are too heterogeneous,
and    do not admit of exact definition            ;  but the third and       most
potent reason has, however, simply been that excessive specialisation
which allows most otherwise competent students of the Protozoa to
remain in entire indifference to the Protophytes, and the even more
general   and deplorable ignorance of the Protozoa which prevails
among microscopic botanists.
   The present theory,          however,     does    away    with the    apparent
heterogeneity      of  the Protista.       On the view that Protozoa           and
Protophytes      alike exhibit more or less specialised and abbreviated
forms of a common life-cycle, the thirteen groups of Hseckel*                   are
seen   to  be   but forms of        one,   and there remains absolutely          no
morphological      reason   for their continued separation (nor for that
matter, any physiological reason either, were such considerations,
irrelevant    as   they   are   to morphological        taxonomy,     any   longer
admissible).      Nor is the objection of Huxley really valid. The
limit between Protista and Animalia remains simply that between
Protozoa and Metazoa       ;  and that between Protozoa and Protophytes
being given up; there remains no more difficulty of separating the
higher plants than there was before — a difficulty               which, however
undoubted, is not increased by uniting the lower forms.
   The thorough unity and naturalness of the Protista being                   thus
obvious, they naturally fall into a series corresponding to the stage*
of the life-cycle.      In   the   Schizomycetes and the Palmellaces the
resting and motile stages are almost equally prominent,                  while    in
Gregarines, and still more in Desmids and Diatoms, and especially
Saccharomycetes,      the encysted stage predominates.          The Protoplast*,
Foraminifera,      Heliozoa,     and   Radiolaria     represent   of  course    the
predominatingly       rhizopod     or amteboid stage, while the Infusorii
represent the ciliated, and the Myxomycetes, as has been said, the
plasmodial.
   It  may at first sight seem        as if the  old grouping of Protophyte?
and Protozoa       were   not seriously      modified, since the ProtophyU
always essentially corresponded to the series of generally encyst*!
forms.    And     so far true ; the encysted series         may still be termed
Protophytes      without    any serious harm.          But it must     be  clear!.'

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                             275
  observed that there remains not one morphological type merely, to
  be   discriminated as Protozoa, but three         — the ciliated,   amoeboid,     and
  plasmodial,   —all,     indeed, physiologically       analogous in exhibiting
  movements       (a phenomenon        of which pure morphology takes abso
  lutely no cognizance),       but  as distinct in form from each other as from
  the encysted       form.     The utter confusion which         has too long main
  tained as to the distinction         of plant and animal life is thus seen to
  be due to the want of that discrimination                of morphological       from
 physiological considerations, which is now happily nearly complete
 in the     study of higher organisms.           In short, though the encysted
 and usually non-motile cells or cell-aggregates              may be conveniently
 termed plants        by the physiologist, and though usually non-encysted
 and     motile    cells or cell-aggregates       may similarly      be grouped       as
 animals,    —yet     the morphologist,       distinguishing     form-history     from
 life-history, must recognise among the Protista                four main lines of
 differentiation,       or four series, which may perhaps conveniently be
termed       Protophyta,      IUiizopoda,    Oiliales,  and Piasmodiales.          (See
 Plat* IV. figs. 1-13 in first series.)
     5-. Phytogeny of Protista.— On this view            also there is no necessity
for the assumption           lately coming into view of the origin of the
Protista from several          distinct stocks, or for accepting, with Bergh,*
so    specialised      a form as Peridinium as a type of the primeval
Protozoon, for all are naturally derivable from a simple Myxomycete
or   Protomyxoid        ancestor.     Of course, this view by no means excludes
the possibility of the remoter and simpler Protamoeboid progenitor
assumed by Haeckel.
     6.  Relation of the Protophytes to the Higher Plants. — Transverse
division may of course occur in the encysted, amoeboid, or ciliated
stage     of the life-cycle of      a celL    When this      takes place    chiefly in
the encysted state the tough and coherent wall holds the resultant
call-aggregate      together ; this cell-aggregate     soon becomes moulded by
the force of the environment into some definite form ; and what we
term a vegetable organism (a Metaphyte                 corresponding to a Meta-
zoon) is the result.
     But the cells of our multicellular plant do not            lose their tendency
to cycle.      Alike in linear, superficial, or solid      aggregates, the cycle is

plainly seen    : and it is scarcely necessary to remind the reader of the
zoospores    of a confervoid Alga, or of the similar mode of reproduc
tion of an Ulva.         It  may be objected that here only two stages of
the cycle are present        ;   but a third, the amoeboid,         not uncommonly
occurs, for that the brief            quiescent state of the zoospore            before
re-encystment may fairly be considered amoeboid, is demonstrated by
such observations as those of Reinke,* who has lately figured                    a true
amoeboid     stage   in the settling    zoospore    of Bangia.
    In Fucus, again, the          ovum- cell has     rejuvenesced, in other word*
has gone through an amoeboid                stage, while other cells rejuvenesce
as    antherozoids into the ciliated           phase.     In the terrestrial    Arche-
goniata, too, we have the same phenomena; even in the Phanerogams,
condemned as all their cells seem to perpetual incarceration, there
remains one fleeting and imperfect recapitulation of the cellular life-
cycle in the embryonic rejuvenescence of the pollen grain and oium
cell (see fig. 15).
     7. Relation of Protozoa             to    Higher Animals. — If         transverse
division occur in the ciliated            state, the new cells must necessarily
almost invariably separate, must row apart, and thus it is natural
that only comparatively few and transitory cases of ciliated aggre
gates    are known.       In the      amceboid     state,   however, the aggregate
produced by division remains much more readily in continuity, and
it would thus       seem much more           probable that the Metazoa should
originate from Protista in which the amoeboid                   stage was   somewhat
 more permanent and more subject to division, than from the ciliated
 f.>rms, as has   sometimes been suggested,           particularly    for the sponges.
     8.  Common or separate           Descent and Affinities of Animalia and
  Vegetabilia.  —  If the preceding facts and deductions be accepted, it
 need    only be briefly pointed out, that the              affinities of plants and
 animals are far closer than botanists                and zoologists are generally
 accustomed to assume, since both are descended                 from a ProtomyxoiJ
 ancestor,    and may, in fact, from our present point                    of view,    be
 described not merely, as the common phrase goes, as amceboid or
 encysted cell- aggregates,         but   as aggregates      of Protomyxomycetes,
 variously    grouped and arranged indeed, but never so highly spe
 cialised  as to lose    all   traces  of their individual ancestral life-cycle.

     bequeathed      by the alchemists to the last encyclopaedist of Gesner's

     not of course been seriously adopted by any philosophical                  biologist
     of  the  century ; hardly the narrowest specialist among zoologists or
    botanists any longer seriously doubts the              validity of the classifica
    tion of natural objects into two groups only          — inorganic and organic —
    yet, at the same       time, the vicious    results of the earlier dogma still
    everywhere       survive,    and Indeed necessarily       so.   For the unity of
    plant and animal        life requires morphological demonstration, and that
   more precise       than has hitherto      been    afforded by merely separating
    off the lowest plants        and animals     into   a  third still   heterogeneous
   group of     Protista.       This deficiency is supplied by the present argu
   ment,     for   if the Protista, the Vegetabilia and the Animalia have
   indeed been correctly interpreted, as somewhat variously specialised
   cell-aggregates derived from an ancestral Protomyxomycete,                  their con
   solidation into      a single kingdom is a matter of course.          In  one edition
  of the Systemd Natura, Linnaeus clearly recognised the fundamental
  unity of plants and animals, by uniting them in opposition to the
  non-living world (Conserta) as Organisata, and this term it is accord
  ingly not only convenient, but necessary forthwith to revive.
      9.   Morphological Classification of Animal              Tissues.- — Histologists
 are    accustomed to recognise three main groups of animal tissues.
 Thus       Cornil     and Ranvier*       distinguish     (1) connective tissues, in
 which the cells are united and separated by a substance of charac
 teristic     form and properties; (2) muscular and nervous tissue, in
 which tho cells have undergone extraordinary                     modifications,      both
structural        and functional; (3) epithelial tissue, in which the cells
possess a       regular and constant evolution.
      In this classification, however,       as  in so many others, morphological
and       physiological characters are not kept distinct.                    In briefly
glancing at morphological characters only, it is evident                   we may best
approach the problem by first noticing some of those cellular trans
formations          made known         by the recent students of embryology.
Histogenesis          must underlie histology.
     An ovum is at first            a naked     amoeboid     cell, then assumes         tho
encysted state, then segments into an aggregate of amoeboid cells                   ;  thia

becomes perhaps a ciliated morula, this again a gastrula,                  with ciliated
ectoderm and amoeboid endoderm                ; this maysettle down       as  in sponges,
its cells re-cycling anew, the eotodermic                 layer becoming amceboid,
the endodermic ciliated (fig. 18).               The endodermic cells remain per
manently more or less amceboid, as the recently much investigated
phenomena of intercellular             digestion have         so clearly established.
The, amceboid       ectodermic cells, on the other hand, may give rise                     to
muscle    — and   a muscle is   but an amoeba elongated so as permanently
to contract along one line         ;  on the other hand, they may pass into
a quiescent     state, or throw out encysting material, which, may either
enclose     them    individually, as in Ascidians, or form                   a collective
external envelope, as in Arthropods.                   The mesodermic           cells  may
either remain unspocialised          as   aimuboid corpuscles, may specialise              as
muscular tissue, or cycle into the resting state, i.e., develop                         into
connective tissue (see fig. 19).
    And if the cell cycle persist thus long in the life-history of                       the
organisms,      why    should     it    disappear?          In reality, it       does    not
disappear completely.          The amoeboid corpuscles             of the perivisceral
fluid of an invertebrate — say an Echinus                — develop, largely        at least,
from the ciliated epithelium              lining of      the   coelome — permanently
exhibit, that is to say, one of the most characteristic phenomena
of the cycle.         And when under proper precautions                     we examine
a fresh     drop of the fluid, we observe               the   corpuscles     as   they die
running together        into a plasmodium,*            so perfectly similar         to that
of   a  Myxomycete        as  actually to have been described               by a recent
observer     as a  new genus and species,           f  And this     phase of the cycle
 takes place, in the so-called coagulation of corpusculate               fluids of inver
 tebrates generally.    J    Numerous other instances of the occurrence of
 some phase of the cell-cycle have               been recorded,     and    have     already
 been collected by the writer          in    a series  of papers which have led to
 the present one ;      it is unnecessary         to call attention     to others, save
 perhaps    the especially interesting announcement by Professor Had-
 don,§ of the occurrence        of a plasmodial union of cells during                    the
 normal histolysis of Polyzoa.

    Thus then       it will   be sufficiently evident that the            morphological
 classification of tissues must be based upon the cell-cycle, the various
permanent tissues being viewed as specialisations of one or other                           of
its fundamental           forms,     or  perhaps      sometimes     as  synthetic typos
between      them.      And, finally,      compressing     the gist of several possible
papers    into as many passing allusions, it is evident that the theory
affords   us a basis       for   the criticism      and compression        of the recent
literature — (1)       of intercellular        digestion (natural to the aina'boid
phase); (2) of that long dispute respecting the origin of the sexual
elements of Hydremia, from ectoderm to endoderm (the colls of both
of which sbow the cycle, and either layer thus develop ova or sper
matozoa);       (3) of the ccelome theory.
    10.   Physiological Rationale of the Cell-Cycle. — It is now time to
demand some physiological rationale for this cycle, which                          has been
hitherto      regarded      as  of morphological interest alone.                A    mass of
protoplasm         anywhere is under constantly               varying     conditions — at
one     time     receiving      abundant       energy    from    the   environment,          at
another     little or   none.       These variations are at least         of three main
kinds    — (1)    temperature,       (2) light, (3) food.       Thus,   then      a  rhythm
of more or less vital activity in definite relation to these conditions
of the environment is inevitable.
    It  is unnecessary        to remind the histological reader how often and
how easily the existence             of this rhythm is verified by actual obser
vation.        Every student is shown the intensification                of anueboid or
ciliary movement            by heat,     and    its depression     by cold        or  electric
shock,     and knows         too the influences of various reagents                  or gases
(i.e., of modification of         foal in     the general    sense) in stimulating           or
retarding       activity.      The dependence         on climate of the cell-cycle of
the lower organisms,           e.g., Protocoectis     or Amoeba, is familiar to every
 microscopist.        The amoeboid           state   varies   widely    with       food and
 temperature;        while the actual transition from the ciliated stage to
 the    amoeboid,       and     conversely, have been            repeatedly observed            ;
 witness the papers of Hieckel, Lankester, and others including the
 writer.*       They     can only be viewed            in fact   as distinct       from the
 morphological         point of view; physiologically,             they show but the
 extremes of one motile state.

      Vast importance       ha3 been     attached to the cellulose wall,           as   an
 assumed      characteristic of plants, yet not only the cyst of a Myxo-
  niycete, but that of an Amoeba, is now known to consist of cellulose.

      Contracting muscle evolves carbonic acid and water, with evolu
 tion of heat      ;  the quantity     of heat    and water       products evolved
  diminishes    as   contractile activity diminishes     ;  and this physiological
 common-place must hold true of every contracting                    cell, ciliated or
 amoeboid.       But contractility      implies    waste    of   formed      materials,
 diminution      of contractility   therefore implies diminution           of this dis
 integration of matter and dissipation of energy, of this combustion
 which     we term waste.       Cessation of contractility,      therefore,    involve?
cessation     of the combustion of some          product —of       some    fuel which
 was formerly         required   to maintain       the process.        The     cellulate
 wall which appears        on the assumption      of  the quiescent     state    is tkut
thj>,  equivalent of the carbonic acid and water which were being
formed       and excreted     during   the   slate   of contraction.        Being       no
 longer required      as fuel, it becomes itself thrown out         as a   waste pro
 duct — which simply by reason of its chemical and physical proper
 ties — its insolubility and coherence — acquires at once its morpho
logical permanence and its protective use.*
     The applicability     of this physiological conception to          a   new series
of problems can here only be briefly hinted at.                Without more         than

from cane sugar,! it may be briefly pointed out (1) that the occurrence
of cellulose in Ascidians, or in pathological cases in the human brain,
&c, is by no means unintelligible — the difficulty is rather the
reverse — to explain why it is not invariably present in resting cells.

   hypothesis      thrown out many years ago by M. Freuiy, our leading
   authority upon        the chemistry        of cellulose — that chitin and other
   analogous bodies        really consist of cellulose linked           with    a proteid,
   seems     well worth reviving.        On this point the researches of Kruken-
   berg,* especially      are promising light,      f
       1 1.   Origin  of the process   of Sexual Reproduction. — The plasmodial
  stage     which terminates the cycle, seems in the first place little more
  than      a mere    mechanical union          of cells exhausted by prolonged
  activity ; in all normal cases          it is soon followed by prolonged repose
  in the encysted         state, and    in  the experiment upon invertebrate cor
  puscles,     by quiescence and death.            In the plasmodia of Protomyxa,
 Myxomycetes,          and of invertebrate corpuscles alike, notably Echinus,
 the    union is followed         by a  brief but extraordinary intensification of
 amoeboid       activity %— the      cause of which, as passing from cellular to
 protoplasmic        physiology, must bo discussed in a subsequent paper.
      Some years ago considerable weight was attached                      by Sachs    § to
 the   hypothesis that the plasmodium formation of Myxomycetes might
 he   regarded as a process of multiple conjugation.                  This view    he now,
 however,       withdraws, || mainly on the ground that the nuclei have
 been     shown not to coalesce as in true conjugation.                    It appears to
 me,    however, that on the present theory the revival                   of that hypo
thesis, though         in  a  somewhat different form, is inevitable.
     No     one doubts that the sexual elements of plants and animals are
represented          by the very slightly           differentiated     conjugating     cells
of Spirogi/ra,         or the almost undifferentiated             cells of Mesocarjtus.
With       these the conjugation          of two Amcebse, two Actinosphreria              or
two Gregarines, are classified             as a  matter of course.        But the recent
observations of Gabriel              upon the multiple         conjugation      of Actino-
sphaeria, or       of Gruber upon that of Gregarines,               leave no doubt that
in these        cases    at least conjugation         may be multiple.           The only
difficulty is that offered by the non-coalescence                  of the nuclei.       But
even        if there    were     aQy  certain     grounds     for   supposing     that the
essence       of the   process lies    in  the  union of the nuclei, rather than in

the union of the protoplasm, we must expect on the evolution theory
an   incipient    stage     in which only the latter phenomenon should
occur.     That the nucleus is not invariable, much              less indispensable,
is of course evidenced by the existence of the Monera, or                  if their dis
tinctness be questioned, we may appeal to the recent demonstration,
apparently by the most refined histological appliances,                 that in young
Actinuphrys     a  nucleus is really absent,* and develops independently
in adult life.      Moreover, on the present view of the almost primordial
nature of the Myxomycetes, their Plasmodium is the only phenomenon
 which at all resembles conjugation, and since we have already viewed
amcuboid,    ciliated, and resting forms             as specialisations of the cor
responding phases, it is no great extension cf the theory to                       vievr
conjugation     as specialised from the plasmodial              phase.      This view
will  be strengthened when            in   the next paper we leave the cell-cyele
to consider the physiological            processes in the protoplasm itself.
    12. Relation       between     Normal and Pathological Tissues. — Unless
the   step  taken by Goodsir and Virchow — of regarding all patho
logical   variations       as  ultimately       expressible in terms of cellular
structure and function, i.e., of the cell theory, be deliberately                      re
traced,  we cannot avoid the application of the present re-statement of
the cell theory to pathology.               To do this in detail would, of       course;
require far more         than the writer's knowledge, but a few brief and
teutative suggestions may be put forward.                Pathologists are reducing
tumours to      a    common type — which             seems essentially that      of cell
multiplication     in the resting or encysted stage.            It is certainly more
easy to suppose, on the            present view, that the appearance          of  a con
nective tissue tumour has been due to the placing of ordinary cells
in new conditions favourable              to the assumption of that phase         of  the
ancestral cycle    ;   or from    a slightly different point of view,       to say that
that inhibition of the cycle essential to the permanence                 of the whole
organism has been locally removed, than, for instance, to suppose, with
Cohnheim, the existence of            a  long dormant mass of embryonic tissue.
    Again, we can easily modify the environment of living cells under
the microscope — we           can     accelerate    or diminish     the   activities     ¦!

  solution of the old dispute, as to whether the integument of certain
  planarians was      amoeboid     or ciliated, was afforded         by specimens       of
  Convoluta which had been kept           for many days in a shallow aquarium,
 scantily      protected at     nights    fiom    the cold of a severe            winter.
 The normally ciliated          cells of the ectoderm could be watched in
 actual progress       of collapse into the amceboid           state, and their cilia
 figured during       their passage into pseudopodia (fig. 24).               Here was
 a  definite    pathological    change,    in approximately known conditions,
 and    distinctly    in terms of the cell-cycle.           Why should not          a dis
 order of the ciliated epithelium of the bronchial               passages be at least
 partly     susceptible    of essentially the same          explanation    1   (fig. 25).
 May not the formation            of pus      be partly   interpreted in terms          of
 degeneration       to the amcBboid          stage, and may not         inflammatory
changes       be regarded as temporary and excessive               intensifications of
cellular activity,      indicating   a  tendency to reversion to the amoeboid
state?
    Whether       these particular       instances be acceptable         to professed
pathologists      or not is after all     a minor consideration, their aim has
been    merely to suggest          that    the phenomena         of the cell-cycle- — •
and    particularly of      those   changes     occurring under definite experi
mental       conditions   —may      be   applicable in their hands to fruitful
research, not      only in pathological histology, but in cellular                 physi
ology and therapeutics.*
    Its adaptability      to the treatment of physiological           speculations is
also    obvious.       Since the activities of the body are the aggregato
activities of its component            cells, not merely        such phenomena as
those of       varying ciliary      activity,   but those    of fatigue and sleep,
of muscular and nervous tonus, and               in fact every rhythm of increas
ing and decreasing cellular activity, become intelligible               when viewed
from     this    most highly generalised           standpoint     of physiology,        as
specialisations of that primeval cellular rhythm which lies before us
in this life-history of the Protomyxomycete.
    13.    Influence of the Environment upon the origin of Plants and
Animals. — One further physiological consideration may be briefly
indicated, from its bearing on general morphology.                     The cell-cyclo
in its entirety is only possible in a fluid medium.                   Without water
 cilia cannot play, without fluid the amceba and tho plasmodium must
         *
            This conception   is somewhat    developed  in the subsequent    paper.

284                     Proceedings      of tlie Royal Society
alike become stationary, and either                dry up or encyst themselves.
The cell-cycle in plants therefore is only found in its entirety in
algae.     Arehegoniates are indeed terrestrial, but their brief cell-cycle
during     fertilisation      is absolutely      dependent upon         the abundant
moisture, without access to which neither moss, liverwort,                    nor pro-
thallium     ever occurs.         Thus it    is that the higher terrestrial plants
have become restricted to the encysted phase.                 Only    to escape death,
has the dryad become thus shut up                  within  the   tree ; but once       so
protected the extensive replacement                   of the cryptogams by           tbe
phanerogams,         in all the less humid climates of the world, is readily
accounted       for.
    Passing to animal life, the vast preponderance                 of aquatic     forms
over terrestrial, is very similarly to be accounted                for by the     aid of
the present theory.            Only   the higher members of a few groups have
successfully emerged from their native element, and their                     existence
depends upon their differentiation of an internal fluid medium, of that
" milieu interieur" upon which Claude Bernard                 was wont to lay such
stress,*   this in turn depending upon the early differentiation of in
ternal cavities.        The interdependence of morphological and physio
logical theory will be sufficiently obvious from such considerations.!
    14.   Theory of Variation. — The more completely one accepts and
reflects upon the theory of natural selection, the more one feels the
necessity      for some view more           satisfactory than heretofore of           the
causes of variation.        J   The present conception of the cell-cycle          seems
to go far towards supplying              this.    On the ordinary        conception of
the cell theory, that of the plant              as an aggregate    of encysted     cells,
and of the animal          as an aggregate;     of essentially amoeboid       ones, the
organism cannot be credited                with any innate variability — its ob
served     variations       are  merely those which it receives, so to speak,
between      hammer        and    anvil — from the forces of the environment.
 The present        conception, however, of all cells, however varied                and
 specialised,     being essentially differentiations        from an encysted,          an
 amu'boid or        a  ciliated form, and of these forms as phases                  of   a
 single form-history, enables us to credit the cells and the resultant
 organism      with an innate tendency              to variation,    and    this   along

certain     definite   and investigable lines.        These modifications would
Btill of course     be largely determined by modification in the environ
ment, yet the change of view is considerable.                On the former view
the organism        is  a   plastic but essentially inert mass, yielding          pas
sively to the forces of the environment ; on the latter,              it is an active
community, of which some or many members, under the influence
of any favourable            change    of conditions,   or the removal of any
restraints,   external      or internal, immediately press into other positions
and functions,       which however apparently new, are either specialisa
tions of the existing,         or reversions to an earlier type.
    Variation and         disease   are   thus  most closely akin ; for since all
variations are ultimately            cellular, pathological   changes     are simply
definable     as those variations        which happen not to be conducive to
success    in the struggle for existence.          And thus we might          proceed
further and further with the discussion of aetiology.
     The preceding theory then, although its range of application, un
limited in the scale of organic nature, may at first sight alarm the
 specialist, is actually founded on a simple but solid basis of observed
 facts ;   it has     been seen     fairly to   meet and    co-ordinate     the   very
 numerous      and hitherto, for the most part quite unrelated problems
 which were enumerated             at the outset, and even to be applicable         t<>
 numerous      minor and unexpected           problems which these suggested.
  And thus, were it even viewed from the standpoint of mathematical
  probability alone,     it  has received   the most overwhelming verification.

                   II. An     Hypothesis of      Cell Structure.
      1. Statement     of   the Problem. — Great attention has, especially of
  recent years,    been paid to the problem of cell structure, and a vast
  body of observations have           been   accumulated.      Of   these many are
  generalised ;     many, however, still remain un co-ordinated, and an
  hypothesis     which attempts at once to unify these, to throw light
   upon the structural and functional aspects of contractile protoplasm,
   and to   unite all these with that theory of the cell-cycle above pro
   pounded, is therefore not untimely, and may, even             if not completely
   exhaustive or satisfactory, be at lea3t suggestive         of  a  better explana
   tion.   Let  us survey a few       of the main peculiarities of protoplasmic
   structure which any such hypothesis must aim at unifying.

286                  Proceedings      of the Royal Society
    The lowest amoeboid         organisms are simply          granular masses        of
protoplasm, but higher forms exhibit             a  differentiation    of  a  hyaline
zone of   "ectoplasm" around        a  more fluid and granular       "endoplasm."
The immense       variability of form, size, and general           appearance     pre
sent among     the   rhizopods has never been sufficiently allowed                for   ;
so  that there is ample reason for doubting whether great numbers of
described species       have   any real distinctness.         Yet the elongated
and reticulated, granular and circulating pseudopodia of the Fora-
minifera, and the radiating, clear, and far less contractile pseudo
podia of the Heliozoa and Kadiolaria            present    a most   vivid contrast,
which wo have        as  yet no means       of explaining.        The remarkable
changes    presented     by ova both before            and  during    fertilisation,*
and the      doubtless     fundamentally       similar     phenomena exhibited
during cell division, require to be accounted                for; while      the long
dispute as to whether          the    "granules"       of protoplasm are really
granules at all, or are the optical expression of the intersections of a
stroma   or network of denser protoplasm, cannot be omitted.                     Such
a  hypothesis must also aim at throwing              light upon the      mystery     of
muscular structure, and must also deal              even with such        apparently
peculiar and exceptional phenomena           as  that "aggregation of the proto
plasm," first described by       Mr Darwin       as occurring in certain cells of
insectivorous plants      f   (which,    when in active digestion, or when
subjected to chemical, electrical, or even mechanical stimuli, exhibit
an aggregation,      or rather segregation         of the protoplasm into two
portions — the outer      more    or less hyaline, but containing irregular
and constantly-changing         streaks   and granules of a more refracting
and fluid substance,       in which the colouring matter, when present,
became accumulated).
    2. StalimnU of       the Hypothesis.    — Darwin        soon   extended      these
 observations to the protoplasm of root hairs, and went on to indicate
 its wide prevalence        throughout     the   vegetable     kingdom.        His  re
 searches   were    verified and extended by             Francis    Darwin.J       who
 showed that these granules did not consist of sap,              as some vegetable
 histologists had suggested, but were essentially protoplasmic in their
 nature.    It is the object of the present paper to apply these facts               to

  the explanation of such problems of cell structure            and contractility
 as those  briefly enumerated above.
     On this view, the granules of such a low vegetable              organism       as
 Torula (disregarding, of course, sap vacuoles and fat globules) are
 aggregation    products, an assumption by no means excessive,                 espe
 cially when we bear in mind the activity of the chemical changes
 which are going on during its life and growth.              But if this    step be
 taken, we cannot resist regarding the Amoeba            in the   same way      ;  its
 granules   too are    aggregation    products,     and   the clear ectoplasm,
 when present,    may be viewed     as  protoplasm in which aggregation             is
 not occurring.      The variations of amoeboid         organisms in more or
less   granular   character (a fact familiar to every observer) is thus
brought into obvious relation with the state of nutrition, or with the
quality and quantity of external stimuli          ;  and its observed increase
when stimulated, and its diminution            during    the    resting state, are
thus    naturally accounted for.       In   the same way, in the granular
pseudopodia of the Foraminifera, aggregation is in progress, in tho
hyaline processes of the Heliozoon not so.             The granules of cells in
higher animals may be, at least to a very large extent, similarly
explained    ; while   the disputes as to the presence           or absence of       a
stroma become clearer when we bear           in mind the fact that Darwin's
aggregation-masses     are at least as often greatly elongated or spherical,
and that they may run       in any direction,    and unite or separate to any
extent.    The remarkable differentiations of protoplasm visible during
cell-division,  as  exhibited by ova (of course excluding yolk granules,
&c), may not improbably admit of the same explanation.
    3.  Contractile    Structures — Mtiscle. — The         excessively    difficult
problem    of muscular structure     has not as yet received any widely-
accepted    solution,   and even respecting matters          of observation the
widest discrepancies exist.        In  many invertebrates we cannot even
he certain    whether the muscles are striped or non-striped, so contra
dictory are the observations, while        in  a   recent   important paper by
Professor Haycraf t,* the homogeneity even of striated muscle is main
tained.    Brilliant light    has,   however,     been    lately   thrown     upon
the arena   of controversy by Professor Kutherford's recent              elaborate
demonstration t that the discrepancies in observation                 are   largely

283                     Proceedings       of the  Royal Society
if    not indeed altogether,           to   be explained       by     the   fact that       the
different observers        have     studied their specimens           in different     stages
of contraction.         When fully extended, and then              alone, the full com
plexity of the structure of striped muscle                    can    be realised; with
slight contraction Fliigel's granules disappear,               then Dobie's globules;
finally,     in completed contraction,           the heads        of adjacent        sareous
elements       come together,      and the fibril is momentarily homogeneous,
the former complexity reappearing on extension.                          So far Professor
 Itutherford's explanation — how              does this come        into relation with
 t he   present    hypothesis?         The    doubly     refracting      portions of        the
 mucle-fibrils      may, on this view, be regarded as aggregation                 granules ;
 for these must inevitably            exhibit    considerable regularity of form
 and arrangement,         when we bear in mind that,            if we admit the exist
 ence of muscle-fibrils at all, we imply that these possess a limiting
 surface,    — of  course tubular in form and ultra-capillary in fineness, —
 and still more so,       if we assume       with many histologists          the existence
 of fixed points afforded            by   Krause's membrane.*              In   short,    it is
 attempted      to compare     the aggregation-granules of a sundew, not only
 with those of an amceba, but even with those most complex and most
 peculiar differentiations of protoplasm observable                  in muscular       tissue.
     4.   Confirmatory Evidence. — The           present    hypothesis is thoroughly
 in accordance with recent researches               as to the nature and composi
 tion      of protoplasm.        Thus      Brass  f   distinguishes        cells into two
 layers,    — the outer      sensory,      the   inner     nutritive,       and    describes
 phenomena        which seem at least closely akin to aggregation.
      Our knowledge of the development of muscle                        also supports the
  hypothesis.       Thus, for instance, WagenerJ shows that muscular fibres
  at first differentiate from the protoplasm of multinucleate cells,                           as
  perfectly smooth fibrils         ("vollig glatte Faden"),            with interfibrillar
  substance.       Later there arises,        as  a secondary differentiation,               the
  refracting and non-refracting             elements     (" Isotropen and Anisotro-
  pen"), which can extend and diminish, also fuse together and                           again
  separate.       In young      heart muscles       these   come     and go under            the
  observer's eye.

      5.  Further     Study    of Aggregation — Cellular       Therapeutics.   — High
 as    is the     importance of observations upon preserved              tissues,   the
 present hypothesis          clearly     points towards the importance of con
 tinuous       observation of living cells when treated            with various re
 agents— aline of         research which Professor       Frommann* is       at present
 almost alone developing,             and with such remarkable results.            We
 must observe         the effects,    not of amnionic carbonate only, but of
 the whole pharmacopoeia,               and not upon the tentacles        of Drosera
 merely, but        upon vegetable        and animal cells and tissues from the
lowest to the highest ; noting the changes which take place in all the
structures       and functions of the cell, and this, under all variations of
temperature,        light, electric    state, and for various periods    of time.
     Of   the practicability     and interest of such an investigation          only a
single instance need be taken.               When  one treats an Actinbsphcerium
with dilute amnionic carbonate, the most striking change results; its
pseudopodia         disappear, its complex protoplastnic structure vanishes;
it loses its regular spherical shape,              and collapses     into an irregu-
gular granular amoeboid             niass    with blunt pseudopodia— (the very
likeness      of the   ancestral   amoeba),   — and then    soon breaks up.
    And similarly         there is  little doubt that such     a reagent   Would pro
duce marked effect upon the epidermic cells of growing tadpoles,                    —a
convenient means             of research.       Thus we    set  out from these re
searches        of  Mr Darwin upon            a general   investigation    into what
changes chemical           substances      produce upon Cells, — an investigation
which touches the general question of pharmacy and therapeutics in
the most direct way, and which                we may in fact speak of as cellular
therapeutics.          The interest of the admission           of  a  drug does not
end when         it has been conveyed into the stomach,            but really begins
there.        We must know what happens             to the component cells of the
organism,       — we    must, in short, observe         the therapeutic effects of
reagents upon the cells of vertebrates,           — an investigation which points
far.       Such observations would not require constant but only frequent
attention for long periods, and are thus perhaps especially suitable
 for the skilled pharmacist.!

   6.  Further CJiemical Considerations.           — It   is an observed fact that
when amoeboid       cells unite into a plasmodium, there takes place the
most remarkable intensification         of the activities of the mass.           The
compound amoeba seem possessed                 of all and more        than all the
activities of its component amoeba — pseudopodia of the most                   extra
ordinary length and size are thrown out, and motion                     is far more
rapid  ;  in short,  it would  seem that not only are the activities of the
component amoeba summed but multiplied.                     The coalescing   amoebae
may be regarded as serving as food to one              another — their    waste pro
ducts and their surplus water are squeezed out and got rid of, and
thus we can readily understand             the summation of their activities.
But how is this apparent multiplication of activity to               be explained    t
   We     have   seen    how   carbonate of        ammonia, an oxidised         body
isomeric with urea, is exceedingly stimulating                 to protoplasm;    and
Mr Darwin's      researches   have also shown that            other alkaloids    and
waste    products are excessively stimulating,              and set up the most
extraordinary aggregation       ;  and that a poison, for instance, may            act
by excessively exaggerating this normal                process.     Here then    is a
use, not merely for the protoplasm, but actually for the waste pro
ducts — the waste       product of one cell acting as          a stimulant when it
meets    the  protoplasm of       another.       And     from this    consideration
again new series of speculative applications radiate off in all direc
tions.     One may suggest that the use of the alkaloids               in  the coffee
or strychnine or Calabar        bean is not merely to protect the young
embryo from being eaten by animals, but as a stimulant to germina
tion.    Or  we may introduce        the same conception into our specula
tions as to the uses of manures, in which                 the most valued consti
tuents are precisely those salts which, like carbonate of ammonia,
produce great aggregation.
   Again, passing from the plasmodial union of cells to the probably
derived union of ovum and spermatozoon,               we cannot avoid imagining
the latter bringing      not merely     a  trifling   contribution    of additional
protoplasm, but a storo of substances              especially stimulating     to the
vast   mass of    the ovum.       And     the    identification    above suggested
of aggregation with the protoplasmic changes visible                  in the ovum
after fertilisation,   is thus seen to be by no means             so improbable     as
mi^ht at first appear.
   7.  Need of ati Explanation         of   the Phenomena        of Aggregation. —

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                 291
  How is it that     if we treat    living protoplasm with certain reagents it
  breaks   up into two substances 1 How are we to explain this
  observed fact   ?   Is  there   any case known to chemists or physicists
 where a chemical reagent          separates a substance,        at first   apparently
 homogeneous, into two distinct substances              which afterwards reunite ;
 or where an electrical or mechanical stimulus                temporarily separates
 a complex mixture         into its components       1   I am    not aware       of any
 parallel case ;     but the absence         of an explanation       underlying       the
 phenomenon       of aggregation itself is after all entirely outside, and
 subsequent    to both the main thesis and the speculative                  corollaries
 of the present paper.
                 III. As      Hypothesis op Contractility.
    If  we imagine a single drop of more or less fluid                 substance     sus
pended    in  a surrounding        medium with which it does not mix, its
surface-tensions tend to keep it in a spherical form.                    This    can   of
course be observed        in  a drop    of oil or   water,    most conveniently in
the  well-known experiment in which oil is suspended in                     a mixture
of alcohol    and water of the same               specific    gravity.     If   now wo
interfere and elongate this drop, its surface tensions at once enable
it to resume the spherical form, even against the resistance                      of the
surrounding       medium.         It   is   inevitable   to   transfer    this    simple
physical    conception       to explain       the function      of muscle.        If  the
elongated components of the muscular fibre be more or less fluid
(as we almost         certainly    know them        to   be,   whether aggregation
granules or not), they must needs                also possess surface tensions;
they must, therefore, also tend to shorten and broaden, and draw
themselves into       a sphere.       And if all   these multitudinous         elements
of the muscle are shortening and broadening, we have of course                         an
explanation of that general shortening                and broadening which we
term the contraction of a muscle.
                   just as the " contracting
                                                      "
    Moreover,                                            drop of oil overcomes           a
resistance, so    the   "                   muscle overcomes a resistance
                          contracting"                                              equal
to the sum of the minute             resistances   which     the millions      or thou
sands    of millions of simultaneously contracting                elements    can over
come.      Finally, an expenditure of energy must needs take place,
and    of this the " negative variation " of contracting muscle (perhaps
of the contracting oil-drop also          ?) may   afford the indication.

292                            Proceedings          of the Royal Society
   Be the latter suggestion                  valid or not, it is important                  to   observe
(1) that we have here (and for the first time so far as the writer is
aware) an hypothesis which explains (o) the shortening and broad
ening of        a    contracting       muscle,       (i>)   its overcoming a mass           resistance,
in other words, that                we have an explanation of the mode                       in   which
almost molecular                   movements          are     converted       into   movement*          of
masses, a solution long sought byphysiologists; and (2), that this
hypothesis depends simply upon the more or less fluid nature of the
essential muscular components, and is entirely independent of                                          the
acceptance            or rejection of the hypothesis                    of the preceding          paper,
which suggests the identification of these muscular components with
aggregation granules.

  In    columns            allotted to the four       Btages    of the cell-cycle (encysted, cili
ated, amoeboid, and plasmodial)                     are arranged         the corresponding        phases
of the form-history of a few typical Protozoa and Protophytes, as also a
series of diiigmms illustrating the normal and pathological form-history
of the cells of higher plants and animals.  All are thus seen to be refer
able to the Protomyxan or Myxomycete type.

(tigs. 10-) 3), and even with                 fertilisation in plants and animals                   (fig*.

      The_ following            Communications were read               :   —
1.    On the Change in the               Peltier Effect due to Variation of
            Temperature.           By Albert Campbell. Communicated by
            Professor Tait.
   The object of this short paper is to give the results of some
further experiments made with a view to determine the variation
in the       Peltier Effect        due to change       of temperature.         These experi
ments are the continuation                of   a set   of similar experiments described
in a paper read to the Society                 in summer 1882.
     The        arrangement        used   was      almost   exactly    the     same          as    that
employed in the former experiments — the                             measurements                 being
made        by   means of an iron-German-silver               thermopile bent into the
shape        of an     arch,    with the ends about         \ inch    apart, and placed so
as to       almost touch the junctions             of the metals whose Peltier Effect
was to be measured.
     The neutral-points             of the various          pairs of       metals    were          also
measured in the usual way by heating up a junction in oil, plotting
the temperature-deflection                curve, and from       it deducing the neutral-
point.          According       to theory,      the ratio     of the Peltier          Effect         at
temperature          to that at tv is determined solely by the values of
                      tx
tv    t2,   and the neutral-point of the metals used; therefore  was not            it
necessary        to draw the thermo-electric lines of the metals.
     As
      I         have no satisfactory measurement of the neutral-point                                of
Pb-Arg, in this                case the   calculated ratio in column                V.   is       from
Professor Tait's diagram.
     In the subjoined table, column                 I.   gives the name of the pair of
metals      ;   II.   and   III.   the lower and upper temperatures at which
the   Peltier Effect           was observed    ;   IV.   the ratio of the Peltier Effects

            2.   On the Problem of the Lathe-Band, and on Problems
                         therewith connected.         By Edward Sang.
           That of the lathe-band is       one of those simple-looking         problems in
       elementary         mechanics    which    present     serious difficulties     to the
       investigator.         The problem is this — " So         to  arrange    the several
       diameters on the fly-wheel and pulley cone of the turning-lathei, as
       that the same band may suit for all."              Thu solution consists of two
                             to each other, the one being
                                                                " to compute the length
        steps converse
        of the      band from given diameters," the other " to compute new
        diameters which may suit the length           so   found."
            If A    represent the lathe centre,       B the centre of the fly-wheel,
        and    if a circle be described round B, having its diameter            R£H    equal
        to the difference between the diameters of the wheel and pulley, the
        two tangents GA, Ag, together with the arc gHG, give the excess
        of the length of the band over the circumference of the pulley, while
        the same two tangents exceed the arc            GKg by     as much as the hand

 is longer than the circumference of the wheel.             Now, if    we write    i
 for the angle    GAB, and   regard   AB     as  the  unit of linear     measure,
 we  easily find
                                       H
                                     Fig. 1.
                    AG  + GH   = cos  i + (\tt + i) sin i=l,
                    AG  - GK = cos t - (Jir - t) sin     * = V.
    Since t  can be found     from the difference of diameters, or that
difference   from i, the two branches of our problem come eventually
to be "   to find I and V from   i," and "    to find  i when   I or I' is given."
The first question is solved by help of the               canon   of sines   ;  the
second    presents greater difficult}', we can get the value of            i  from
that of I only by       a series   of trials.     Yet, in truth,     there is no
essential difference between the two processes, both consist of
trials ; but the existence of the canon of sines, renders the trials in
the former     case so easy, that we come          to regard the operation as
direct.    If  we had a table of the values of           I corresponding     to  all
values   of i  from zero to the right angle, we would be able to resolve
both problems with like facility.

  In applying such        a table to the business                 in hand, we should                  have
to compute the circumference from the diameter, and afterwards
the diameter from the circumference.  This double arithmetical
                                                                   all
operation may be avoided by the simple contrivance of counting
in diameters ; for the length of the band, wo substitute the diameter
of the circle which it would gird.                  Writing them
                          W = diameter            of wheel,
                          P = diameter            of pulley,
                          B   = diameter for band, wo have
                    W   -P    = 2 sin t      ,
   From a table constructed according to these formula, the dimen
sions of the lathe may be got by little more tlian inspection.
   The actual tablo and the mode of using         exhaust the mechani it,
cian's interest in the subject, but, to the speculative mathematician,
some connected points may appear to be deserving of notice.
      Our ordinary tables, arranged according to the ancient graduation,
 are exceedingly inconvenient,                   because       the ratio—       L        expressed           in
 degrees        and minutes would involve,                    in each case,              a    troublesome
 division.        The decimal subdivision                of the gradient was                       therefor;
 preferred, and the computations                    made          for each thousandth                    part,

 The     canon    of "sines measured              in degrees" had               been          prepared,      in
 order to compile the table of circular segments, used for the compu
 tation of the anomalies of the                    planets        ;   the term                     was     thus
                                                                                             As-
 ready to hand.           In this way              the    construction              of   the       table    for
  lathe-bands was greatly facilitated.

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                              297
   to balance     each   other, or may happen to concur in one direction,
   hence there is a possibility         of error in the last place, proportional to
   the   complexity      of   the    work.       This error may, in the present
   instance, amount to 2 or even 3 units              in the last place.        Hence it
   follows that, in shortening from tm places               to the six places in the
   final table, an uncertainty in the sixth place must occur when the
   rejected figures     are  within the limits 4997 and 5003,                as happens
  thrice in the course of the work.               Hence the necessity for founding
  our working tables on more extensive ones.
      All   possible    cases    of the mechanical         problem      are   comprised
  between the limits i = 0 and            i = \ie ; while i passes    from the one to
  the other of these limits, the line            AG makes the quarter of         a turn,
  and we naturally inquire, What happens when the motion is farther
  continued     ?  or how was it on the other side of the zero             ?
     On changing       the sign of     i,  the expressions    for B  - P and     R  -W
  change     places ; the wheel takes the place of the pulley.                   This is
 clearly   seen in the second figure        ;
 the    change from       DC with its
 inclination       inwards,     to    D'C
 inclined     outwards,      is   accom
 panied by        a reversion in        the
sizes    of the circles.        Hence it
will    suffice for us to examine
the phases for values of             i   be
yond the right        angle.
     In  order to this, let the circle
described      with    the radius      AE,
fig. 3, represent the pulley,
which we shall suppose to re
main      unchanged         while       the
inclination of the band            varies.
When that inclination is zero,
as in the position D0C0, the
wheel is of the       same size as the
pulley; but when the band is                                  Fig. 2.
inclined, as in the position DC, the radius of                 the wheel has grown
to be    BD or BM, and the half length of the band is made up of the
three parts FD, DC, CE.               When t becomes a right angle, the points

 I)   and   C have come up E, and ths band                encompasses    the whole
 circle whoso radius is        BR
     Imagine now that the point of contact C lias passed beyond                    E
 into the position       c ;  the tangent takes the position dc, so that tha
 course of the band is from            F along the    arc FDMrf    and  back along

t/rE    to E  ;   the half-length    being still made up of the three          parts
Yd, dc, cE      ;  but in counting the length dc and cE must be regarded
as  subtractive.
    In tli is way    the imaginary band is shorter than the circumference
of the wheel, by        as   much  as,  in the symmetric position, the actual
band had been longer.
    Beyond the limits t=         ±£t, the mechanical         arrangement   fails to
illustrate    the properties of the above            expressions,   and therefore,
regarding them         as  purely analytical formula;, we may proceed to
examine their characters.
    Placing     the arc i, representative       of the inclination, along the line
of abscissa?, and setting up the values of              I and   V as ordinate*, we

to the origin           0   ; the one        curve being converse to the other.
     We may put             these formulae                in   a more          convenient form by trans
posing the origin of abscissa in the one caso to                                                    - \ir,   in the other

in this way confine our attention to one of the curves, whose equa

     In order          to determine the singular points in the curve, we must

each term being the derivative of that above it.
     On equating any one of these functions to zero, we                        get  (1st) the
intersection of its curve with the line of abscissa?, (2nd) the cul
minations of the curve belonging to the function immediately
above,       and (3rd) the points of reflexure of the curve of two                      steps
up    ;  hence we are mostly concerned              with the solution of the general
equation
                                       „Fx or    „<f>x
                                                       = 0 .
     The equation Fx = x.sinx = 0 is satisfied in two ways, by making
x   = 0    or by making einx = 0.              jSto\v   sinx becomes         zero for   every
value of x = nir, n being any integer positive or negative                           number,
and hence the curve, shown in tig. 5, crosses the line of abscissae at
equal       intervals of     t, counting from        the zero      point; and     since x = 0
coincides with one of the values sinx = 0, the curve touches the axis
at the origin.
     The conjugate equation             <£x
                                            =  x. cosx, is also satisfied        by putting
,;- =   0 or by cosx = 0, the latter condition giving for x any value                       of
tin; form             l)ir ;   hence,    besides    the crossing at the origin,           this
                (n +
 curve crosses the axis of abscissa) at points distant by the interval
7r,  reckoned from         Jjr  on either side of the zero.
     The solution of the adfected equations is somewhat more complex.
 Beginning with the            case   _,Fx  =  - xoosx      +  sinx, which is that of the
 actual lathe-band, we observe               that the function becomes zero when

 is satisfied.      "We have thus the problem          " to find an arc equal to its
 own tangenl"
     Having applied,         at the end of the radius         OA,   a   tangent to the
 circle,   let us suppose         two points thence         to set    out with equal
 velocities, the one q to travel along the tangent, the other p to move
 along the circumference of the circle, carrying with it an indefinitely
               O           B

extended       radius Op.       At first this    secant  will   precede the point y,
and by the time q has reached               the distance Ab, equal to the quad
rant   AB,    the intersection has moved off to an infinite distance along
to tangent.         After this     the point of intersection        reappears   on    the
other side and         comes    up to   A just when     q reaches     the distance Ac
equal to the half -circumference ABC.                The intersection now chases
the travelling point q and comes up to it at Q, somewhat before                           p
has reached the third quadrant.                  The first root of our equation,
that is AQ or ABCP, is below the value x = %tt.                     In the 6ame way
we readily perceive that the next root is when p has made more
than an entire revolution by nearly a quadrant, that is when it has
crime to P'     a   little before B   ;  the root, then, is rather less than       -jjir.
    The numerical values            may be found      by  a  very rapid approxima
tion.     Assuming        x=fir    = Aa, we compute the         arc  of which this is
the tangent       ;   we regard     the length of this arc as a new tangent,
compute the length of the arc thereto belonging, and so continue
until there     be no change        within   the limits of the precision at which
we aim.        Three or four operations exhaust the precision of seven-
place tables.          The   successive    approximations      are thus represented
by   the symbols
                                        tan -=(f,r),
and    so on, so that we have           x=  tan~ *(*ir) ; where      so  stands for an
indefinitely large integer number.

    The roots of this equation are actually

                        805-56 = 895-48 = 14-0662
    For the crossings  of the curve belonging to the function ,F.r,             we
get the condition
                                 ar =   -tanx,
and, in this case, the points        p  and    q must move        away from A in
opposite directions, and the first coincidence             will take place when p
is somewhat beyond the extremity of the                quadrant AU ; the phases
are so closely analogous to those           of the preceding case that it        is
unnecessary to detail them.
    The functions   $x   and          give the conditions
                        x = cotx and      x=    - cotx   .
    In  these  cases,  when    q begins       its motion       from  A   along the
tangent, the travelling point p must leave B, in the one case travel-
                                       Fig. 7.
 ling backwards towards       A, in the other          case forwards    towards C
 Thus the   same artifice serves for the detection of the roots in all the
 four equations.
     As  an  example of the other cases, we may take the function
 _jFx«=xco8x- 3sin.t      ; this, when equated to zero, become*

      We shall therefore         suppose      that the travelling     points p and     q
   leave   A   simultaneously        in the same direction,         but that p moves
  thrice    as fast as q ; here    we    see  that the radius    0/> must make moro
  than half      a turu before its intersection with the tangent can over
  take    q.    Proceeding      by the same method of approximation,                we
  readily find the arc       AP   to be 233° 40', its tangent        AQ being   1.3594
  in terms of the radius.              Each succeeding coincidence must occur
  after an interval         of rather more        than half     a  turn,  so  that the
  approximations         are    rapid.       The    second    coincidence    is   when
  x=   AP'PAF        reaches 428° 07', the tangent          AQ' being 2.4907.
     The     same method is applicable           to the other cases of the general
 problem.
     Thus the consideration of this elementary problem in mechanical
 construction       leads us to examine the properties of a whole class of
 functions, which,        again,   may serve to suggest further extensions and
 inquiries.

         Eobert W. Felkin, F.R.S.E., F.R.G.S., Fellow of the
         Anthropological           Societies      of London        and   Berlin,   &c.
         (Plate V.)
     The following       notes    have been compiled from my own observa
tion, when in Central Africa in               1880, from inquiries     I  made on the
spot, and from the information                I have obtained from       a native who
has been my faithful servant during the past few years.
     They treat of      a people    inhabiting a largo tract of country situated
5°    N.   lat., 30° 20' E. long, of Greenwich, of which the chief town
is said     to be Bengue.
     The Arab      customs,    which are being introduced among the races
in Central Africa,         are rapidly breaking down the boundaries              which
exist between         the tribes, and superseding their primitive habits and
customs, which in a few years               will  be things of the past.      For this
reason      I  have been induced to bring together all the information
it   has been my good fortune to collect, and whilst regretting that
the record is not        so complete as one could have wished,             I yet hope
that it may prove of          some value, or at       all events of interest, to those
 engaged in the study of anthropology.

     The tribe called Madi by the Arabs give themselves                              the   name        of
Mora, and must not                 be confounded            with   the Madis       on the east         of
the Nile, or with another so-called                     Madi tribe       on the west.
     I am    not able to give the exact population of the district, but                                     I
have ascertained             that it has diminished                 considerably during the
List ten years, owing to the fact that many of the people                                have been
taken away          as slaves,     while numbers of the young men have been
drafted into the Egyptian army, where they have obtained                                   a   reputa
tion for courage, fidelity, and veracity.
     I    will    commence        by giving a description of the way in which
the Madi builds his hut, so that you may first see him in his home,
and then follow him as he goes to his daily work, or enters into the
various pursuits of           a    far from monotonous life.
     Habitations. — The process of constructing                      a   hut is     as   follows: —
A circle         is marked on the ground by means of a string attached to
a    stick in the centre,            and in this circle poles are fixed into the
earth.       These poles are made from thick straight peeled branches of
a    tree    called    "pi," and           they       are    encircled    by rows of supple
saplings, which             are tied to them at intervals                   of about       li       feet.
Grass is then taken, cut the same length as the poles, about                                   6 feet,
and       placed    upright in bundles round the framework, after which
saplings are again tied round to keep the grass in position.                                         The
roof is made on the same plan, a strong circular foundation of wood
being first put together,              into which wooden rafters are fixed, and
being brought together in the centre,                          are secured         at their     upper
ends.        Circles of saplings are fixed on to the rafters, and then grass
is       laid on, and fastened             as    in     the case of the        wall.       The top
of the roof is formed of                   a    large       bundle of grass cut even and
bound firmly           together at the lower end.                    A     stake    about       4    feet
high is thrust through               it,   and then fastened on to the top of the
roof.       The     loose    ends     of grass are then bent downwards,                              and
secured to the roof, and              the free end of the stake              is    ornamented          by
an ostrich egg and feather.
     There are no windows in these huts, and only one entrance, about
    3£   feet high    and     2A    feet   wide;        a   door of wicker work            is       madi'
to slide backwards                and forwards inside across this entrance,                          and
is   kept in place by two poles fixed firmly in the ground, and                                      tied
at the top to the roof.

      Trenches        are dug round the huts before              the   rains set In at a
   sufficient     distance fur the water dripping            off the roof to fall into
   them.      A small channel from           the trench carries      off this water to      a
  convenient        distance.
     Furniture.       — These dwellings do not contain many articles of
  furniture.         The principal one is the bed, which is made from the stem
  of a plant called yougo, resembling the sugar cane.                      Narrow pieces
  of the stem are cut about               6 feet   long, laid side by side, fastened
  together      by strips of cow hide, and then fixed on to three wooden
  cross bare.        This is  raised from the ground ahout 3 feet upon six            thick
  round wooden legs,           to which the cross        bars   are tied, the     whole is
 then covered with           a  cow hide.
     A    large earthenware jar is an indispensable piece of furniture.                    It
 is about 4 feet deep and 5 feet wide,                 with   a narrow neck, and is
 placed on        a  wooden stand, generally formed of the forked branch of
 a  tree.      It   contains a good supply of semsem seed (Egnoir), which
 is   used      for making         porridge,   and from which oil is obtained.
 Another jar of the            same shape, but smaller, contains water, and is
placed near the entrance.
     The     bare ground, which is well trodden and beaten to make                  it firm,
forms the floor, and            a  wood fire is generally burning           in the centre
of it.       Jars of varying        shapes and sizes are placed round the hut on
the      floor,    or hung from the walls in string nets.                  They    contain
different kinds of dhurra, also honey, butter, dried sugar cane,
salt, &c. Baskets made of dhurra stalks are also hung round the
but,     more for ornament than use            it would    seem.      Bundles of arrows,
spears, bows, and knives serve the same purpose when not in use.
     Besides       the   principal     hut, each family       usually has      a   hut for
strangers ; and as soon             as  children arrive at the age of four or five
years, the father builds a separate hut for the girls and one for the
boys,       or several     neighbours club together in these                huts.    These
additional buildings              contain only beds,        a water     jar, and     a few
basket work ornaments.
     Granaries.       —Another       erection   is constructed     as   a storehouse     for
dhurra.          The circular wall is made like that of the other huts, of
poles and grass, but             it has a flat wooden roof upon which              is fixed
an upper chamber of basket work (literally a huge basket), in which
the dhurra is kept.              Over it is placed     a  roof similar to the one de

  306                   Proceedings       of  the   Royal Society
  scribed above.       This roof is kept in        place by three poles which           pass
  through its outer rim, and are fixed into the ground below,                          apart
 from the walls.
     The lower part of this building is used              as a  kitchen, and contains
  a number of large stones          for crushing corn, and jars for holding it
 Meat is also hung from the ceiling.                 The dhurra can only be           taken
 out of the granary from above.              The roof is pushed up with              a long
 pole, which when rested            on the ground keeps           it   raised  ;  a woman
 then ascends from outside by means of one of the three supporting
 poles,  which is     a kind of ladder, for it is          made    of   a tree   stem, the
 broken stumps of branches forming the steps.
     Gardens. — Flowers are cultivated              close round      the dwelling huts,
 but the garden, which seems to be an indispensable belonging,                          lies
 behind the hut, covers generally              a   large  extent of ground, and            is
 devoted to the cultivation          of fruits     and vegetables.         The beds      are
 circular and raised about 3 feet, falling abruptly to the ground all
 round.      Melons, gourds, and vegetable             marrows are grown on them,
 and creep      gracefully      down the sides          and along the         unoccupied
 ground beneath.          Some beds       are 3 feet wide, and of great             length,
 and are planted with sogo (yams?),              which twine up         a  double row of
 sticks about    12   feet  in height.
    A   poisonous bulb, in appearance            like our onion, is planted          round
 the dwelling, and its leaves are put about the huts to keep away
 serpents   and mosquitoes.          Arrows are also poisoned with it.
     Cattle. — Cattle    forms the chief wealth of the tribe.                 A rich   man
 may have as many as 200 head, a very poor one only three or four.
 The    average number possessed            by one man is from thirty to forty.
 A  large   enclosure (or kraal) is erected for them at a short distance
from the village, and cows belonging to different families herd
together in one kraal.          This is circular, with strong              wooden     walls
and no roof.        Inside    there are two smaller enclosures             — one for    the
calves, and one for the man              in  charge,    the latter having a roof of
wood and grass.            A   fire   is  made      between    these      two divisions.
Should     the rains be very heavy,             a  temporary roof is constructed
for the calves    ;  sometimes even, the people take them into their own
huts.     The  care of the cattle is not the             work of one man in par
ticular, but the owners take it in turns to sleep with them at night,
and    take them to grass by day.              Cattle are never let out to gra«

  till  the dew is off the grass            ;   eating wet grass is said        to cause   a
 plague.       They are milked            by men, and women make butter from
 the    milk in gourds.            The cows are called by names, either accord
 ing to their marking, or,             if favourite    ones, after some near relation
 of the owner.           They     are not branded or marked            in any way, but
 identified without.            If   a  cow is troublesome, a bell is put round its
 neck.
     In   the holiday season the cows are taken by young men and boys
 to a distance, for change             of air and food, and brought back after a
few weeks.            The    people     in whose district      the  cattle feed are per
mitted to use the milk, and in return provide the keepers with food
and shelter.
     There is      a special kind of black cow (sometimes red), whose milk
is kept solely for its master's use, or for its calf. A man usually
possesses       at least one such animaL
     It  is usual to      kill cattle    at the beginning      of the rains, when they
are needed for food by the people employed                     in sowing     the crops.
     Cows     suffer from       sore legs and serpent bites.            In the first   case,
they     are  killed and       eaten, but the       flesh of those bitten by snakes is
considered to be injurious.
     Food. — The Madis              consume      a large   amount of animal food, of
which there is a great variety, especially in the hunting season.
     The buffalo, tetel, wild boar, gazelle, and hippopotamus are all
commonly           eaten ; while       the elephant, rhinoceros, crocodile, eland,
and. fox are           partaken of occasionally.            Among     domestic animals
consumed are the cow, sheep, and gout, though cows are only eaten
at harvest time and at funeral ceremonies.                       Wild ducks,       pigeons,
fowls, and guineafowls may                    be added to the list,        and sometimes
ostriches      ;   but fowls        are   only eaten      by young children        and old
 people.          Several     varieties     of fish are found       in the rivers, and
eaten.
       Of the     vegetables    cultivated, marrows, cucumbers, sweet potatoes,
 yams,      peas,     beans,     and greens        are the   principal   ;  and the most
 common          fruits   are    figs,   nuts,   melons, and the fruit of the date
 palm.       Several       varieties of dhurra          are made   into bread,      as also
 occasionally        a  root called morako, but the bread is usually of the
 consistency of our porridge.                  A substitute for our butter is found
 in the      semsem        seed,     which     is roasted,   ground,    and    eaten   with

    melted and poured over the porridge.                                 Both cows' and goats' milk                 is

           There do not appear to be any articles                                  of food forbidden,            but
    some         people        do not    think it well            to eat liver, fish, sheep's head, or
    goats.          The earth thrown up by ants is sometimes eaten, but                                       those
    who do it are considered                      mad.
           Oil    is    made     from semsem                seed.       The seed is ground, boiling
    water        poured over         it,     and the     oil     squeezed      out with the hand on               a
    grinding stone, caught in a gourd, and poured into jars.
         No      spices are used, but redeb,                   a     stone fruit,     is   made into     a    pulp,
    and mixed               with porridge, when               the latter      is   boiled.       Salt    is   used,
    and      is     kept by some people                  for sale.           Honey and          deli    stem     are
    added to sweeten food.
         The       ino.st     expensive articles of food appear to be semsem, milk,
    cows, sheep, and goats.
           Cooking.         — The cooking           is   either dono           in the room             under the
    granary,           or outside       the      entrance        to the      dwelling       hut, where        three
    stones         are always placed.                Between these             a    fire   is   made, and the
    cooking vessels are placed upon the stones.                                 The women are the               sole
    cooks.             They have        a   superstitious practice of putting white                           ashes
    on      the        pots     before       placing anything                inside   ;    some    words         are
    muttered at the same time, and this                                is   supposed       to make       the food
    more         satisfying       when cooked.                   Small      cooking operations             are    at
    times done in the hut.
         Refuse         is   deposited       in heaps about             1   00 yards from the hut, and
    cleared away periodically.
         Meat will keep two days, but                        is   considered       at its best on the first
    day after killing.              It      is   boiled and also roasted over the fire.                       Meat
    and fish are dried in the sun for keeping.                                     Fresh fish       is   boiled   ;
    dried fish boiled or broiled.                     Fowls         and all kinds of birds are boiled.
    ]S'o    spit       is   used to roast meat          ;   it   is   laid across two pieces of               wood
    arranged over              the fire.         Meat    is    not fried.       The use of hot             stone;
    in boiling          is    unknown.           Porridge and bread are mixed in                   a     pot over
                                                                                                   "

      dokn flour,    with   a little butter added, is boiled with milk.            Vege
      tables are eaten alone,      bread being used       with meat
         The cooking vessels are         earthenware jars.       Mixing sticks   are the
      only cooking     utensils used besides         knives.    They are cleaned after
     use.    No vegetable broths or stews are made.              Farinaceous puddings
     are  unknown.        Meat very well cooked is preferred.             Preserving of
     fruit with sugar and        pickling of     vegetables  are unknown.
        The only beverages are water,             milk, and dhurra    beer.    This   beer
    is made
                by the women       in  large quantities, and kept       in jars in  a  hut
    set   apart  for the purpose.          To this hut the people          go to   drink.
    It  is common        property,    and not paid for.         They do not take the
    beer home,      or  drink it at   meals.
       There are three meals         in  the day — before     sunrise, at midday, ami
   at sunset.       No    ceremonies      are observed at the commencement of
   ¦Deals,   nor are there any religious rites connected            with them.
       When fine, meals are taken outside the entrance to the hut near
   the   cooking place.         It is customary for members of different house
  holds to meet        together for dinner, each family providing a bowl of
   food,   round which they sit, and eat from one bowl after another,
  using     their fingers as spoons          and forks.      They always wash their
  hands      before     and after meals,        a  jar of water being provided for
  the purpose,       but the water is not poured over the hands. The men
  and boys        sit in one group, the women and girls in another. The
  women do         not wait on their husbands, the food when ready being
 fetched by the children.                Any stranger who may chance to pass
 by is invited         to share the     meal.      Water is always kept at the door
 nf the hut to give to passers by.                   Wooden    stools are used outside
 the     dwelling, but it is not considered proper to use them at meals.
 The      gathering does not disperse directly                the meal    is over,    but
 digestion is aided by telling and hearing tales.
     No cannibalism           exists in the country, and the people express
 great     abhorrence of the custom            as  practised by their neighbours the
Nyam-Nyams.
     Fire.   —Wood         is used for       fire, and lighted      with dried     grass.
The fire is produced by friction of wood, one piece of wood about
the size and shape of a large pencil                  being rapidly rotated in a hole
in a flat piece of hard wood.               One man holds the hard wood steady,
whilst two others take it in turn to rotate the stick

      Smoking. — Tobacco ia used to                     a great          extent for smoking, but it
is not chewed,        nor used         as snuff,            The native name is tabba, which
is,    however, commonly used in other tribes also.                                      I       believe         the
tobacco smoked            to be indigenous, for none                         is   imported.           It   is   very
good,     but exceedingly              strong.           It    is   cultivated,         and the             leaves,
being sun-dried and broken up in small pieces, are then mixed                                                   vvitli
a     small proportion of dried cows' dung and urine, and moulded                                               into
conical cakes, weighing about                    J      lb. to      1    lb. each.      These         cakes       are
dried in the sun, and stored away in baskets hung up in the huts.
      Two kinds of pipes are used, both made of clay.                                        One      measures
about six inches long, with                 a   very thick stem and oval bowl                     ;    the stem
i*    not put into the mouth, but the lips are pressed round                                      the hole         in
it.     The other pipe          is   itself small, but has               a   wooden stem about three
feet long   ;    this pipe       is    rarely carried              about, but smoked               in or        near
the huts.        The pipe        is   ignited by burning                     charcoal   being placed              on
the top of the tobacco;                a    naming stick                is   never used.          Two small
sticks serve      as tongs to take the                  bit of charcoal from the                  fire.
      Water pipes are unknown, and                     I      have not heard of any substitute
for tobacco      ;   as    that plant grows in great profusion,                           I       should not
imagine that one would be required.                                The people smoke           a    great deal,
but do not carry the practice                         to any injurious             degree.        Other nar
cotics    are to the best of my belief unknown.                                     A   root, however,               is
sometimes        chewed,        which has the repute of exciting sexual                                passion.
      Agriculture.   —    A     large area of land             is   cultivated.         After         the forest
has been cleared away by                    felling and burning,                   the ground             is   hoed.
Hoeing and           weeding          are       the    only processes which                  it   undergoes.
There      is   no irrigation, but the soil                   is   prepared       for the seed             as soon
as the    first rain falls, after which there                      is   plenty of water.              The land
is    usually marked out in long narrow strips by large stones                                              placed,
at equal distances.              Each man cultivates his own land                            ;    and      if   it   is
of considerable           extent, and requires more hands than his family                                        can
give, he calls       in     the aid         of his friends and neighbours.                             On       such
occasions no pay           is   given or expected, but all are ready to give                                     and
receive help in this way.
      The hoeing     is    done by men,               and     the hoes          used are made of iron
with wooden handles.                    The process of weeding                     is   delegated           to the
women,      and      there       are three,           kinds of hoes used for the                       purpose.
Sometimes         they kneel down between                           the rows of corn, and use                        a

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                            311
   short one ; or    if standing,    there are two other shapes           employe d.
   The two first kinds      of hoe are made of wood and              iron, the lust
  solely  of wood.
      The married    women always carry a knife in their girdles, which
  they use amongst      other things for cutting corn.         Its wooden handle
  is either carved    or ornamented with iron.         These implements are all
 of home manufacture,          there heing a good supply of iron               in the
 country.      The   wooden handles are often ornamented, and differ
  ranch  in shape.       One very common shape             I  noticed was       much
 that of a tortoise, but apparently there was no design                  in it  ; and
 no attempt seems made          by these people to represent anything               by
 carving,   as  obtains in other tribes.
     Hammers     and anvils are often made of iron, but stone               ones arc
 also used;    there are no other stone implements.
     The weeds are gathered       together into little heaps, and left on the
 ground    until it is    prepared    for  seed again, when they are hoed           in
 with the soil.        Underwood       is burnt on the field.         Digging and
 mowing are dispensed with.
    No animals are used in the cultivation           of the soil.
    Six months of the year are dry, and six months more or less rainy.
At times the rains are very heavy.              The corn is sown at the          com
mencement        of the rains, and       some early   kinds    are reaped     in fino
periods between the rains.          Most of the crops ripen and           are reaped
when the       dry weather    sets in.     The soil is  so fertile that two and
three crops     may be sown in one year.
    There    are  four varieties of dhurra,       besides    dokn and telaboon,
which are species       of dhurra having very small grain.             The   seed of
some    of these kinds is mixed and sown together.                An early      and  a
late kind are sown        in different rows in the       same field.       After the
early sort (I61i) has ripened and has been reaped, semsem is sown in
its place, or sometimes           the ground is planted with a kind of
cucumber.        A  cereal called deli is sown       in   the gardens ; its grain,
however, is not eaten, but only kept             for  seed.     The   stems,    which
grow as high       as 20 feet and about 2 inches in diameter, are sweet,
and resemble        sugar-cane.     They    are dried,    peeled,   and eaten      un
cooked ; sometimes they are cut            in small  pieces, dried over the fire,
ground, and mixed with semsem.                 Dokn stalks       are  dried in the
huts, tied into bundles, and used as torches.               The dhurra stalks are

 312                              Proceedings        of   the      Royal Society
 used     as food           for the   cattle,      or made into baskets.                      Salt is also             ob
 tained from them.                   The women burn them                    to ashes, which are mixed
 with water and well boiled, the water is then skimmed, stirred,                                                      and
 boiled down, and the salt dried.                               Salt is     also     made from the root
 of a tree, from the stalk of                     a cereal      (yobung) grown for the                     purpose,
 and some is also obtained from salt springs.
     When the corn is ripe, the women cut                                 it,   and tie       it   into     sheaves,
 laying the stalks in                     opposite directions.                  The men collect                   these
 bundles, and carry them on their heads to the " langas." These
 "        "
   langas   are frames constructed for the purpose of drying the corn.
 They consist of wooden                       poles placed at equal distances apart, and
 supporting cross beams of wood, which are again crossed                                                by      others.
 On this frame the sheaves are placed; they remain for about                                               a   month,
and then the ears are removed to the granaries.                                         When        required for
use, the corn           is    thrashed by women, who beat                          it     with sticks           over   a
basket.           It   is   then winnowed.            Dokn          is   thrashed in          a   different       way   ;
the ears are placed                  in   a   tall wooden tub, and beaten with                               a    pole,
much like our dollying.                           The corn       is   ground between two                        stones,
like the Egyptian mohakka.                           One very large heavy stone                            is   place.l
on the ground and chipped with                                 a    small one          till   it   is     flattened,
then    it   is   rubbed smooth with another stone, the process occupying
two or three days.                   A    small oval-shaped stone                    is   used for grinding
the corn upon the large one.
     Land. — The acquisition                      of land       appears         to be an easy matter.
It   may be obtained from                     a   neighbour by mutual arrangement,                               or    by
reclaiming        it   from forest or jungle.                  A    piece of land once appropriated
descends      from father to son, and the chief of the tribe has no right
to any but his own landed property.                                  No definite boundaries                      exist
to mark the limits of villages or districts;                               but     a   sort of indefinable
understanding appears to obtain.                               Landmarks may be seen dividing
strips of land owned by different people in one village                                       ;    they consist
of large stones placed at intervals of about 100 yards.                                             Hedges            are
unknown,           and no corresponding protection                              is   found         necessary           to
                              •
ward off wind.
     Plots of land           are protected from depredation by watchmen.                                          Pits
and traps are also made to catch elephants, buffaloes, and gazelle*.
These larger animals are, however, not so troublesome                                              as   ants anJ
mice, which often eat the corn.                           It   is   also frequently injured                  by    tbe
intense heat of the sun, which shrivels                             it   up before
                                                                                          it
                                                                                          is       ripe.

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                            313
        Crops  are   grown on the same       plot   of land for several         years
   running, and often twice        in  a year.    When       at last the     produce
   yielded begins to degenerate,      the ground is left fallow       for  a year or
   two.
       Migrations are frequent, as the result of a discovery of good soil            ;
  sometimes a      whole village   will migrate    to a new place.          On such
  occasions    the people    may be seen   flitting by small companies           at a
  time, about ten men       leaving at once, making      a sufficient number to
 carry the wooden        framework of the roof of a hut, which they take
 with them.
      The only exportation       consists in corn being        sold    or given to
 neighbouring tribes when they are suffering from bad crops.

                                          — The hair is extremely frizzly,              fine
             (41
 in texture, and abundant, and grows in spiral tufts, the routs being
 equally    distributed      over the head,          but thickest at the        top.        It
 appears    to be     capable of         growing     to  a  considerable    length,        its
 growth being favoured            by a very free use of grease (without which
 it dries and comes out).              The men allow their hair to grow about
 6   inches,   i.e., when untwisted aud measured.                  The women wear
 their hair rather longer, and             with   them the    hair is trained to hang
 down    ; the men's, on the other hand, is more upright.                 When it        has
 grown to these lengths they shave               it entirely  ofr.   In shaving,       some
 people leave a     narrow ring of hair all round their heads like               a  crown      ;
 others leave three or four tufts, according to the tribal number ; others
 again leave      a great many small tufts growing.                This is     a   fanciful
 arrangement,       and has no particular signification.
    Dyeing the hair is not practised.                Baldness before old age is very
 uncommon.          The hair is rather darker in colour than              the     skin   ;   it
turns     grey    about middle         life.    Only women practise the art of
shaving ; they make           it a  profession, and unite with it the extraction
of teeth ; the four upper and lower incisors being extracted from
both sexes       alike at puberty.            A curved knife is      used for shaving,
the outer edge being sharp.                 Having     placed the man's head          in her
lap, the barber proceeds           to cut off the tufts of hair, she then squirts

  milk from her own breast on              to the     scalp, rubs it well      in,  and
  applies the razor.        Scissors are unknown.            The eyebrows     are also
  removed,    as is  all other hair found       on the body.      The hair from      the
  upp     lip and cliin is often pulled out by               the roots.    Sometimes
  very old men       will permit    a few white       hairs to grow on the chin.
 The women        are paid for their services       with   an arrow.
     Odour. — Notwithstanding           their frequent        ablutions,  the Madis
  have an odour         peculiarly   their own.          It  cannot be said to        be
  produced      by dirty habits. It is always present, is varied by
  the oil and fat with which they anoint themselves, and is much
  intensified by muscular exertion, e.g., running, carrying loads, &c
     Clothing. — The Madis do not wear any clothes, unless the word
 can be applied       to a string   which the women put round their             waists,
 and from which hang          a  few leaves before and behind.
     Physical Powers. — With          regard     to  the physical     powers of     the
 Madis    I  can only give some very general notes, as             I was not able     to
 put their strength to the test with any amount of accuracy.
     The following remarks will give           some idea of their strength       : —
     They    make     admirable    porters,   being very careful of the loads
 entrusted to them, and display no little forethought and ingenuity
 in preserving them from injury.              The rule is that no load should
 exceed     50   lb.  in weight, and that it should             be either square      or
 oblong, the latter being preferred.              They always carry the load         on
 the head, on a pad         made of grass, very rarely steadying         it with    the
 hand unless going over very rough ground.                     They strongly    object
 to carry loads over 50 lbs.;         jut if  pressed      will take them up     to 70
lbs.,  if the distance      to be marched is not more than three days, and
 extra food is given them.
     Loads of 100 or 120 lbs. are carried by two men, hung on a pole,
 which they balance on their heads            ;   but they do not like the work.
If   a very heavy load lias to be carried, e.g., a man, they place him
on   a native bed and carry him, two at                a  time, changing relays of
men at about each          mile.   This they prefer to carrying by four men
at once.      I  can   testify from personal experience that it is far better
to be carried by two men than four, for they go much more easily,
and do not run against so many trees or overhanging                         branches.
The relief    men march before those who are bearers, and cry out wh*n
obstacles occur.

                           of Edinburgh, Session 18S3-84.                           317
        As regards     distance,    they carry loads of 50 lbs. 20 miles a day,
     for eight or ten     consecutive days without showing signs of distress            ;
     but on the march        they appear to require     a great   deal of water, and
     will sooner burden themselves         with   a gourd    full than   go without   it
     for more   than two hours at a time.            If  they go by a road where
     water is scarce,     they generally take a few women or children              with
    them to carry     it.     When they arrive at      a stream,    all loads   are put
    down, and     they bathe       if the water is   deep,   or sit down and wash
    themselves    if it  be shallow, and then take a long         drink.     Europeans
    would probably        prefer to drink first !
       The Madis can scarcely ever be prevailed upon to march at night,
   even   in bright moonlight, on account of bad roads, which is strange,
   as  their eyesight      is remarkably good.       Neither will they start until
   the dew has disappeared,           from off the gras3, or     if made to do so by
   promises    of reward they tie bunches of grass or skins before them,
  to avoid as     much      as   possible being wet by the dew.          In crossing   a
  river    of four or five feet deep, they stand in the water in a double
  rjw, and hand the loads from one to the other.                   Should the stream
  be   very strong, they break down branches              which have broad forks,
 and placing       one     end firmly in the bed of the stream, lean against
  the fork,    and so get the needed support.
      They    march at        a  quick pace, but generally halt for 10 or 20
 minutes after each three or four miles.               Should heavy rain come on
 they like to stop and shelter themselves and their loads under                 quickly
 improvised shelters.
      In carrying the Egyptian post            these    men make long and quick
marches,       60 or 70 miles often being accomplished                 in twenty-four
 hours.
      Pathology. — The Madis are a healthy race, and do not suffer very
much sickness.             Coughs occur during and after the rains, but very
few people die          of pulmonary complaints.
      There   are   male and female doctors, but           the males      confine their
practice to wounds, accidents, and snake bites, and do not receive
payment, but have their food given to them when they are attending
a case.
      Wounds of the extremities heal very quickly.                  They    are washed
and covered         up with      a paste made   from the roots of shrubs, ground
and mixed        with     a little cold water.    Scalp wounds give more trouble,

chest      are not much feared,                  but when they occur in the abdomen
they are almost always fatal
     The people suffer from                 abscesses, which               are opened,         well washed
with water, and then                 dressed      with the above-mentioned                      paste.
     Hydrocele is not as common as among neighbouring tribes.                                              They
try to cure         it by long-continued                pressure of the hands, but without
much success.
     The treatment of a broken arm or leg is noteworthy.                                             "When it
is a simple fracture, the limb                     is pulled as straight as possible,                         an I

are     made, and cupping                  horns applied.                These horns are made                   of
cows'       horns.        If    when the swelling               has        been       reduced they still
cannot straighten the limb, they cut the broken bones out, and                                                 fix
on spliuts, applying                 a   powdered root to the wound.                           Hiemorrhai.i'
is   stopped by actual cautery.                    This operation               is   rarely successful,         as
most people who undergo                     it   die in   a   few days.
   The doctors impart their knowledge                           to young men, but their own
sons do not follow their profession.
      If       man   is   bitten by            snake,     the wound                  well sucked or
                                                                            if is

parts       scarified, and cupping                 horns applied                     handy,     and then         a
powdered root             is   freely applied.            This root        is    very expensive,          a   cow
boing often given in exchange for                         a   small quantity of            it
      Women          doctors treat          all cases besides               those      mentioned above,
and receive           one cow, two               sheep,    or   a    bundle of arrows for their
services.           They have but few medicines, and seem to make frequent
use of magic.             When         a   women doctor         is   called to visit           a   patient sk
brings with her           a     basket containing what              I      may call her magic wand.
It    is    a   kind of double tube about                       a   foot long,          each       tube    being
about       4   inches in diameter.               The one tube             is   partly filled with smal
stones, the other               is   empty, to allow of the doctor performing                                  her
manipulations             in it.         This instrument            is   painted red, and oiled                 all
over.          The doctor shakes            the wand, and mutters to herself for some
little time, then              feels the patient          all over and draws her wand                         over
him.           When pain          is     complained of in the abdomen                          or chest,       she
first rubs the part with oil, and then places                                        her wand over it-.

painful       spot, introducing            her hand into the empty tube.                                After
working about for some time she at last draws out a substance                                          which
she calls the disease,              taking care that the people shall not have any
opportunity of seeing               it closely.     If   pain is felt in the head, she cups
the patient on            the temples or nape of the neck by making small cuts
with a sharp stone ; an iron                      knife is not        used.       Cupping              is also
employed for very severe pain                     in other parts of        the body.
     These women doctors appear to be generally right                                   in their prog
nosis.         When        their      work is over they are always                       accompanied
home        by the head of the house                     (see    Odi for the treatment of
children).
     Medicine is given internally for fevers, which are generally caught
through bathing or getting wet after sunset.                              An infusion is                made
from a root after             it   has been   dried and scraped, and this is drunk
by the patient at frequent intervals.                           Profuse       perspiration             results
after a few doses.                 Toothache occurs in old people, but only rarely
are    caries        seen.         They do not extract             the     tooth        at        once,     but
loosen      it gradually by working it about                      a   little    each         day until it
comes out.
     Epileptic fits would seem to be of rare occurrence,                                as   I     could not
hear anything             of them.
     Small-pox occurs in epidemics                   ; great     numbers of the people                      die
from     it   ;   and     it is    rare to see a person pitted, as only                      very strong
constitutions recover.                 When       a man is attacked by            it,   he    is   placed     in
a   hut which has            a     sand floor, and       a   large fire    is   made         in   it   to keep
the patient very warm.                     Meat    is   never given him, and only                      a   small
quantity of food, such                thin porridge. When the pustules are well
                                      as
formed         they are       all opened with thorn, and then an infusion of
                                                        a
roots and leaves             is    given to the patient to drink twice                   a    day.
      The     people         are    very    particular       to rub       their    bodies all               over
frequently with oil, for               if   this be neglected         a   scaly eruption results,
which         is,   however, soon cured by an extra amount of oil.
      As yet there            is     very little syphilis         in the country, but                      it    is
gradually making its way from the north and east.
      There         are   very few         dwarfs   ;    they are considered                  to    be     great
curiosities, but are not ill-treated.                        Hunchbacks         are more common,
and occur            in about equal proportions among men and                                women,        so far
as  I    could discover.

  320                    Proceedings        of the Royal Society
      Marriage      Customs.    — The Madis         are not allowed to marry amongst
  their    own    friends,     but  generally obtain wives from neighbouring
  villages.     Just about      the time when a young man arrives at puberty
  his father makes         a  tour of the surrounding villages in search of                     a
  suitable bride for his son.            Having found         one to his mind, he ties          a
  twig of    a certain   tree round her wrist, usually the left one, and then
 seeks her father's          permission for her to marry the youth.                      If  the
 price to be paid in cows and sheep can be amicably settled,                          there is
 seldom any further difficulty in obtaining his consent.
      If a  young man meets          a  girl during his travels and she takes his
 fancy, he is at liberty to ask her to marry him, and                      if she  is willing
 he ties a twig round her wrist.                 She then goes home and tells                her
 mother what has taken place, and the mother informs the                                father,
 who sends for the young niau, and                  if  ho approves     of him, gives        his
 consent      to the union, at the same time stating the price he wants
 for his daughter.             The young man            has then to obtain          his own
 father's    permission.        He tells him of his choice, and the price                 to lie
 paid for her, and        as a   rule the father does not withhold              his  consent.
 The news is then published abroad that So-and-so's                        son is to marry
 So-and-so's      daughter, and         so  much is to be the marriage               portion.
 Should      the parents       not come to terms, the marriage does not                    take
 place, for the young people must always obey their parents                            in this
 matter, and runaway matches do not occur.                         Both young men and
 maidens      appear    to be    faithful     to their choice, and       I  have not been
able to hear of a case of          jilting.
     Before the marriage          takes    place, the young man may go and                   see
his fiancee whenever he likes.                   Meanwhile       he works hard         to get
together      as many cattle         and as much grain as possible, to enable
him      to  begin housekeeping.               When       he   has   passed     the   age      of
puberty by        a year     or so, the    girl being      also of a marriageable           age,
their friends are informed that the wedding will soon be celebrated.
    The girl's father builds her            a  new hut, into which she goes              a few
days before the marriage           ceremony       takes place.      The dancing ground
is also swept and made ready.
    The young man, on his part, collects together                       the    cattle to      bo
given for his bride.            His friends all make him              presents,   the most
substantial        help    coming      from his        father,   mother,      and    father's
brothers.        The payment must be made in cows of one year old,                            or

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                              321
   bulls of two or three years,            also  one   one-year-old fat cow       as   an
   extra gift for the feast to take place at the bride's village.
       On the morning of the day on which the ceremonies                 are to begin,
   a  band of youths proceed from the bride's village to the bridegroom,
   who hands      over to them the stipulated             number of cattle.        Each
   youth leads one cow by a rope tied to its leg, its neck being orna
  mented     by a garland of leaves.          Thus they     are taken to the bride's
  father.    A  group of unmarried girls, from the bridegroom's village,
  accompany the youths, and              the bridegroom's brothers and sisters
  make up     the party.        Should     he be an only child, two of his best
  friends or unmarried         relations join the band.         He himself remains
  behind.     On their arrival the cattle are counted before the bride's
  hut, and   if found correct       as to  number and quality, as is usually the
  case,  they are sent to the         cattle pen, but are not mixed        with cattle
  belonging    to the bride's father, which are previously removed to a
  distance.     Should the      tale not be correct,     a messenger    is sent to the
 bridegroom's      village,   if it  be near, to fetch the remainder        ; but   if at
 a   distance, the ceremonies        are delayed a day, or may be more.            This
 mishap, however,          rarely happens,      as care is taken by the bride's
 father that the      right number of youths          are sent, and the bridegroom
 is  particular to provide the corresponding number of cows, so that
mistakes are usually avoided.
     The fatted cow is        killed by the bridegroom's brothers in front of
the bride's hut, and their cooking operations commence                    and a great
feast    is held, after which dancing takes place.               Very often nothing
but water is     drunk     at the feast ; and    if  beer is provided   it very rarely,
if    ever, leads    to drunkenness.          During the feast and subsequent
dancing,     which lasts two        days, the bride is not allowed to leave her
hut;      but she is not left quite alone,            as  her future brothers and
sisters-in-law     keep her company, and expatiate meanwhile on the
virtues of her         future    husband, and the delights          of married life.
They also fetch her food, but retire while she eats, as              it is not proper
for them to see her at her meals.
     On the third day there is another feast, on which occasion the
bride's father provides the cow, and dancing follows as before.                  Then
the bride, for the first time, leaves her hut, and goes to the dancing
ground, accompanied by her brothers-in-law,                   who walk one before
and one behind           her.    They   proceed     to the centre    of the dancing

322                        Proceedings     of   the  Royal Society
ground, round which an assembly of spectators                         sit or stand under
the shade of the treos.              The brothers-in-law then retire to              a short
distance      from the bride       ; she is welcomed by a loud shout, and then
begins      to dance the particular marriage             step, which lasts a long time,
and is accompanied             by special    music and clapping of hands.                   The
longer she keeps on dancing the more creditable it is to her.                              It  is
a   proud time to the lady, and she takes great pains to show off                         well,
and to please the spectators.               Afterwards      she retires to her hut, and
word is sent to her bridegroom that she has acquitted herself well.
The next day she               rests   after her tiring        exertions,     and the       dav
following the bridegroom arrives, attended by his unmarried friends
of both sexes, relieves           his brothers of their charge, enters the                 hut,
 and claims his bride.
     The happy pair remain eight or ten days together                      in that    village,
 being supplied with food by friends, who also fetch them water                             and
 firewood,      in order to save them trouble.             During this time       the father
 of the bridegroom is engaged in constructing for his son                        a new hut,
 and on the eighth or tenth day the newly-married couple come and
 pay a     visit   to it.    A  sheep    is  killed    at the   door, after which they
 enter     over     the body and blood of the animal.                 The bride is        then
 only presented           to her father and mother-in-law, and remains                   there
 two days, but never eats in the presence of her husband's                           parents.
 The young couple             return to the lady's village, re-occupy               her hut,
 and    remain       there a   variable time — until, in        fact, the lady is in an
 interesting condition.             As  soon     as  this occurs, they return to             the
 husband's hut, and settle down to their usual pursuits.
     Divorce is not common,            and   if  a  woman is barren it rarely          occurs.
 It  may, however, take place             if  a  wife makes herself disagreeable              to
 her husband, friends, and relations, and also                     if   she   should     prove
 unfaithful      ;   but this is  a rare occurrence.         Should divorce take          place
 for any just        cause, the wife is sent back to her father, and he refunds
 the greater part of the cattle, the number varying according to cir
cumstances.
     If  a  wife wishes to visit her friends or relations at                a distance,      her
 husband accompanies her, and fetches her back at the end of the visit
     Polygamy         is permitted, but is not very common,                  and   seems      to
 be regulated more             by a man's         wealth than anything           else.      The
 greatest number of wives allowed appears to be four, and                              a long

                                                                                                           niin

 period       (two years       1)   elapses     between each new marriage.                         Each wife
 has a       separate hut, and the husband passes a definite number of days
with each in rotation.                   This is regulated                as    circumstances may re
quire,        but each wife expects                     her    full allowance.               When      this   is
granted,        as     it usually        is,   the wives live on good terms with one
another.
       Should          woman who has                 child        be divorced,           the divorce has
                                                                                     it if

husband        ;   but    if   she    should be divorced from any other cause,                             she
keeps the          child.      In    either case, the father and mother can                          visit the
child, or       it     may go on        a      visit for       a   few weeks to either parent
Women who have been divorced              may, but seldom do, marry again                                     ;
should       they do so, they are to be had cheap, and the children, there                           if
be     any, from the previous marriage remain                                  with the grandfather.
The Madi             women generally make very good wives, and married
life   is    apparently        a    smooth one.           Prostitution in            a   general sense        is
unknown.               Before marriage the girls are very carefully looked afU-r,
bat as marriage                usually takes place                very early, there           is   not much
cause       for them to go wrong.                 This        also applies to the men.
     Reproduction and Birth,                    <J"c.
                                                        —Early       marriages         appear      to be the
rule, and, as           before mentioned, polygamy obtains only to                                 a   limited
extent.         It   is   very difficult        to give facts as regards                     the number of
children born, Sec, but                a   few notes may be of interest
     Four children would seem to be                           a   fair   average      family.        Few die
directly after birth.                 Twins occur             at times, and are considered very
lucky both to the parents and to the village at                                 which they           are born.
Many         congratulations           are offered,           but no special ceremonies                   take
place at       their birth.         I   could not hear of                 a    single case of triplets,
but one woman was                      said to have had four children                           at   a   birth.
Girls and boys are equally valued, but                               a   boy    is   generally preferred
as     the first child.
     As   a   rule, labours are very easy.                     As soon as       a    woman thinks that
she     is   near her time of delivery, she abstains from meat, but eats                                      a
good deal          of vegetable food.                She gets       a    neighbour to help to clear
out her hut, sends her children, should she have any, to friends, and
when labour commences,                     she walks round her hut, while her friends
place     a   deep layer of dry sand at                       a   short distance from the door.
Sometimes two good-sized                       stakes are driven into the ground, about

324                       Proceedings           of   the    Royal Society
2   J   feet apart ; and the sand is banked up near them.                              The woman
then sits down on a skin placed on the sand, puts her feet up against
the stakes, and clasps her ankles with her hands, her arms                                        being
inside the knees.           Her friends take it in turn to support her                            back,
and at times aid her by pressing or rubbing the abdomen.                                     Another
friend squats down before her to receive                         the child as soon           as born.
The         sand, of course, moulds           itself to the woman's body, and                    being
pushed down in front, might almost be said to support the perimeum.
A       fire is kept burning in the hut, and a very thin porridge is                             given
the woman at short intervals.                        She keeps        remarkably        quiet,     and
often never moves           from her first position until after the child                            is
born, her friends keeping up all the time                        a   low kind of        chant, and
doing all they can to encourage                      her.    When      the child is born,           the
cord is cut by a stone                  knife   as a rule, but sometimes               it   is bitten.
Should the cord bleed, the woman who has received the child                                       takes
the cord        in her mouth and             squeezes       it with her    teeth, so stopping
all     haemorrhage.      They never tie the cord.   The placenta is buried
in      a   hole dug outside the hut — that of the boys on one side, that of
girls on the other.          Still births        are very rare.
        When all is over, the mother is gently moved to the side of                                 the
fire, where she lies down on a bed made of dried grass covered with
a   skin.       As soon   as the   child is born, it is         cleaned    by gentle rubbing,
and then smeared with oil and wrapped up in                                a     soft skin,       after
which it is shown to its father, grandfather, and other friends.                                    In
about an hour after birth it is put to the breast   The mother                                     gets
about again in three or four days.                           She then sits with her child
in the 'door of her hut, and                     receives      the    congratulations of           her
friends.         The woman is not allowed to eat meat for about                               a week
after her confinement.
        On the occasion of a child's name being given                      it,   a   fowl   is   killed
by the father and grandfather before assembled                            friends.          They cut
off the animal's head, apply some of the blood to the child, and
pronounce the name.                It   is   not at all uncommon for children to                    be
named according to the season in which                          they are   born — e.g., Kran-
obu = famine        ;   Kradaru = hunting             season.        At other    times they are
called after their deceased relations, rarely after living ones.                             Family
names         do not obtain, but         a   son bears his father's name              in    addition
to his       own;   more frequently,          however, pot names are used.

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                            325
        In tliis district women do at times bring forth their children on
    the march,     and then continue marching ; but this is by no means a
    frequent    occurrence,   and is guarded against       as  much as possible.        I
    have known       it happen   on two or three occasions,        but the result in
   one case     was fatal to the mother.
       When a hard labour occurs, and a woman remains a long time
   undelivered, so that her strength begins to give way, a man is sent
   for to deliver       the child.    He, however, uses no instruments            ;  and
   should he fail, which,        I  am told, hardly ever happens, mother and
   child as a rule perish,       for abdominal section is not practised             here.
   Barren      women      are  uncommon.       Very few births          occur out of
  wedlock, but         I was  not able to obtain much information              on that
  point.
       The women suckle their children           about two years, but the period
  of their     separation from their husband is only six or eight months.
  If   several mothers are suckling          at the same time,      it is not uncom
  mon     for them to suckle each other's children;              and  I  have once     or
  twice seen a       small child, who did not find sufficient milk in his own
  mother's breasts,        toddle off to another sitting by and commence to
 suck     away     without rebuff.      DuriDg    lactation the breasts are of an
 unusually large size.           After  several   children    have been born they
 liecome     very flabby, and hang down like long flaps of skin.                A cord
 is then      tied round the chest to prevent them flapping about and
 causing inconvenience.
      When born, the babies are of a reddish tinge, and they get dark
gradually.          The women carry their infants in skins which            have been
dried in the sun and scraped              clean   and smooth with a stone, and
softened with butter.            The skins of goats, gazelles, sheep, and calves
are used, the         legs being tied together and strung over the mother's
shoulders.          The baby is placed in the skin under the woman's                arm,
with its head          behind.     Sometimes    a  gourd is placed over the head
to protect       it from the    sun.   When older the child is carried           on the
arm.       Infanticide is unknown.
      Education       of Children. —A    good deal of attention         is paid to the
instruction of children           in matters of conduct.          They   are taught to
liehave well at meals, not to put their hands into the dish                   till after
their elders have helped themselves, to rise as soon as finished, and
having washed their hands, to remove                  to  a  little distance.      They
      vol. xn.                                                                T

326                   Proceedings of the Royal Society
are also taught to be quiet when older persons are holding                 a   council
or chat.     They are made to salute           people     in  passing, and to show
kindness to the aged and to the sick.
   The girls are taught to cook, to sweep out the huts (with bundles
of fine dried grass), to show hospitality to strangers, to fetch water
and firewood,     to elude   arrows at     a   fight, to dance, and to perform
" Ionian "     movements.       The    boys are       taught to shoot,       to fight
(blunt arrows being used), the proper way to treat an enemy, &c.
   The education of boys and girls is not considered to be com
plete  until they      have   travelled.      When about         ten years     of   age
they are sent away from home to visit                    friends and relations        at
distant villages or among        neighbouring tribes.           They remain       away
during the     fine months of the year.            The girls may return at          any
time, but the boys are usually anxious to remain away                    as   long    as
possible,  in order to learn      as  much      as  they can from contact with
other people.       Should   the girls wish to come home, the boys will
bring them, and       as  soon   as  they    have     seen them     safe with thoir
relations, they start off again.           The boys must,          however,     return
home when the rains         begin, and remain during           the wet months, to
help their fathers in agricultural work             ;   whereas the girls,     if  they
choose, may stay      away; if    wanted, they are sent for.           When out       on
these visits the young people take part in the hunts, dances, or what
ever   else may      be going on.        Sometimes a father will take his
children   a  round of visits.
   Both boys and girls are taught to find their way about,                 so that if
the   path should       bo lost   they are not long in discovering their
whereabouts.
   Family Gatherings. — There            does not appear         to be any special
occasion    for family gatherings,       but from time to time all the            sons,
daughters,     and grandchildren meet at the father's house.                The    love
for children causes great interest to be expressed                about  the babies.
At   such    family   gatherings the father directs the thoughts of all
to grandparents and old friends who have passed away, enforcing                        at
the same time the duty of attention and care to relatives and friends
when ill, and of mourning for them                 when dead, as they then           are
beyond the reach of help.
   Tribal   Signs.  — Each division of       the tribe has a number,        by which
those   who belong to it are known.                Persons are said to carry          so

     many stones,        but this           ia   merely           a   form of speech,         as   the stones        are
     not literally carried.             The lumps of earth thrown into                             a man's grave
  correspond to his number of tribal stones,                                     and in this way also             will
  a man        often regulate the number of tufts of hair to be                                          left   on his
  head after         shaving.
       Burial       Customs.      — Immediately it is known that                               a   man is fatally
 wounded, the news is sent to his wife, who hastens                                                to him, taking
 their children              with     her.        A     touching sceno is witnessed when they
 reach        the    dying father.                    The little children               are   placed upon his
 knee, and           the others stand round about him, while he gives them
 his     "               "
             blessing        by putting his hands on their head and moving his
 mouth as           if spitting.             After telling them                      to be good, and not to
 grieve too much              for him,           he solemnly addresses his eldest son,                          giving
 into his charge his mother, brothers and sisters                                       ;   also the fields and
 cows.         He also is careful                 to tell     him through what tribe                     he has met
 with death,            in order that his son may                              some    day revenge          him by
killing one or two men of that tribe.                                          Then follows             an affecting
farewell        to his wife.                If   he is a well-known                   man, and not far from
his home, a great company of his friends and acquaintances gather
round to take leave of him.                             While the body is being carried to his
hut, a drum             is sounded               as   an intimation that he is dead.   This is
also done at the               hut     if    a    man dies at home, and is repeated                             at the
buriaL          The body is usually buried                                  one day after death, close               by
the man's           hut, but        sometimes               by his father's.
     A   deep round              hole is made in the ground, and at the bottom of
this     a deep recess           is scooped out.                      In   this recess the corpse is placed,
being        laid on the right side with the                               head leaning on the right hand.
Lumps of earth are then thrown                                    into the hole by the children, first
with their backs towards                              it,   and then their faces, the number of
lumps         coinciding with the number by which the                                       deceased's       tribe   is
known,          the     girls throwing                      one       less    each    time    than       the boys.
A    pole or tree            trunk      is       then fixed in the ground at the bottom of
the hole,           which     is      not filled            up, but covered by two large stones
placed against the pole.                          Sometimes there                is   no pole,     if      stone can
                                                                                                    is a
be    found large enough to cover the hole.                                           Over this            erected    a
conical mound of earth, three or four feet high, which                                             is   stabbed by
flat stones.            If   a   pole has been placed in the grave                            it   projects above
this mound, and                  is   surmounted by the horns of cows killed by the

grave.         Four           cows         are killed     by the friends out of respect for                         the
departed,        and the eldest son often kills his favourite ox.
    If    a     great         man          has   died, friends and relations                        come     from        a
distance to the burial, and stay           few weeks (four?) mourning for

the dead.            For the first four nights they sleep on skins by the
grave,        and during the remainder of                                 the time        they pay frequent
visits to it and make lamentations.                                      The deceased's widow resigns
all household duties to                          a sister     or friend, and gives herself up to
weeping during                     a   month.
    At    the end of this time a lamb is                            killed    ;   it   is subsequently eaten
by the friends, as were                            the    cows          killed on        the       day of burial.
The son leads the lamb to the grave, but it is killed by                                                   a man of
a semi-priestly order (whose office it is to perform such like duties
on various occasions).  This man, after killing the animal, sprinkles
its blood on the people and the grave.                                     After speaking            at length on
the virtues of the deceased,                             he       sprinkles       the    people       with       water,
exhorts them to put away their sorrow, and to show kindness
towards each other.                           The friends then take their leave, but                          a year
after the man's death all his relations and friends who live near                                                 meet
again      and       celebrate               the day by a feast and dance                      ;    and on        these
occasions the dance is never followed by a fight.
    If a      woman           die her friends mourn her loss also for a month, hut
for children the time of mourning is only                                    a    few days.
    If   a man           should be killed at                  a    fight or hunt, and the place                    and
manner of his death be unknown, his friends go and search for                                                       his
body, and if they cannot identify                                 it,   they bury any bones they                   may
find about the place of supposed death.
    As     soon          as    the period of              mourning for             a     father      is    over, the
children        (if young)                 are taken to their father's family, and                     a   consulta
tion     is    held       as       to what       is    the best         thing to be done with                    them.
They are usually placed                            inside the circle of consulting relations,
and      if   old enough                   are asked whether they                 will    stay and live with
their father's people, or go with their mother.                                         The mother          is   urged
to remain            in the village, but she usually prefers                               to go to her own
relations, and                as       a   rule the children go with her.                          Sometimes        the
eldest        son,   if        he       is   old enough,          will remain            on his       late father's
property and look after                          it,   the mother with the rest of the children
going, for           a   time at least, to live with one of her brothers.                                        Later

        Treatment       of   Superiors.    —There          appear to he no rules of precedence
     nor any difference         in   the treatment of rich and poor.                      The poor are
  generally those whose               parents have died when they were young, or
  those whose        father's cows have been stolen by an enemy.                            In this     case
  the      children are adopted by relations, and when they marry,                                a   small
  number of cows are given to them as presents                             to start them          in life.
      Each village        is   quite independent, having               a   president or sub-chief
 at    its head     ;   only in time of war must the men from each village
 assemble,          under the head chief, who resides                      in the largest town.
 The village head-men and even                             the chiefs are treated with great
 familiarity, no spirit of subjection or fear apparently existing.
      Hospitality.       — Hospitality          is    inculcated and universally practised
 to   kinsfolk, neighbours, strangers and enemies.
      A    passer-by     is    invariably invited to share any meal which                         is    pro
 ceeding, and a refusal to partake of the proffered kindness                                       is   con
 sidered as an offence.               If   he    is   in   a   hurry, and does not wish to bo
 delayed,         politeness requires him to dip his hand in the dish and
to eat        a   mouthful       before     proceeding on his way.                   At   a   meal      tho
guests sit on the ground, and help themselves out of the common
dish.         Water      is   brought them to wash their hands, children                                per
forming this duty.                   Water      is    always at hand to offer to passing
travellers.          Every family          has   a     hut for the special           use of visitors,
and    if   guests arrive unexpectedly when the hut                         is   already occupied,
the children are turned out to sleep at                          a   neighbour's, and their hut
appropriated to the visitors.
      Treatment          of    Women,      —Women              are   treated with respect               and
politeness          by the     men, who always show them preference,                          resigning
to their use the best places, and paying them such                                   like    courtesies.
They eat at the same time, though not out of the same dish as tho
men; but associate with them on equal terms, being consulted and
honoured. Any insult to woman revenged, and frequently the
                                           a                is                   is
cause of war.                very little known, but in the case of
                          Drunkenness           is                                                           a
man becoming intoxicated, and in that condition insulting   woman,                            a
he    is   punished by being tied up until perfectly                        sober.
     Treatment          of   the Aged and         Infirm. — In        the training of children,
obedience and great respect for parents and elders are inculcated.

330                    Proceedings     of   the  Royal Society
Great care and attention            are   paid to the aged,       and counsel      and
teaching from them is considered of special value.                   The sick      and
infirm are cared for and nursed with much solicitude.                  Much      affec
tionate care is exhibited by husbands to their sick wives.
    Communications.        —The     construction     of the roads is very simple,
a track of some two feet wide being formed by merely cutting down
the underwood of the forest.               More than this is not attempted          ;  a
network of small paths in the forest being made by use.                     Swamps
are usually passed by wading, although occasionally a way across them
is made by filling in with stones, sticks, and grass.
    Rivers   are crossed      by swimming, an art which is learnt very
early, as is also an       acquaintance with the haunts of crocodiles and
hippopotami         and the shallow parts of the rivers, so that should                a
man be carried down by a swift current he is quite at home,                        and
 knows    where best to make for land.                  Boats and even rafts         art-
 unknown,      but bridges are occasionally constructed over rivers,               and
 are made as follows       : — Trunks of      trees are firmly fixed  in  the bed of
 a  river in the dry season, being supported by stones,                 and having
 forked tops along which is laid a single row of logs — thus forming
 a simple kind of bridge.
    No accommodation is provided for travellers between                     villages;
 they rest where rivers or wells supply them with water,                   and then
 continue their journey        till a village is reached.
    On a journey,       if a man cannot find        a stream, he digs for water in
 the ground     ;   and the wells thus formed last for        a time, and   serve for
 tho use of other travellers.
    When     a    village is reached      there is no lack of accommodation,
 hospitality      being universally      shown alike to friends and         enemies.
 Immediately a stranger is seen, he is asked how many stones                          h.1
 carries (see Tribal Signs).          If   the man who accosts       him is of the
 same number, they fraternise directly;              but in any case, the stranger
 is escorted     round the place to       see   all there is to be seen, and a hnl
 and food are given him.
    .No vehicles of any description             are used, the only mode of con
 veying persons who are too old or too                ill to walk is by   means of       »
 kind of litter        made   of branches laid side          by side, and fasten.
 together on to cross pieces of wood.                 Upon this rude     contrivance
 the  individual lies or sits,      and is carried by two or four men.

                         of Edinlnirgh, Session 1883-84.                               331
     Horses are not known,           nor     are any animals used          as  beasts    of
  burden; but their need is little felt,            as  the necessaries       of life are
  very few.      Heavy weights, such          as  animals or fish, are often slung
 on a pole,    and carried between two men              ;  while trunks of trees are
 transported by the simultaneous efforts of men,                 pulling   to the sound
 of their voices.
    It  is customary for meeting travellers to exchange greetings,                        a
                            our " How do you
                                                           "
 phrase    answering to                               do     beginning tho conversa
 tion.    The young are carefully instructed by their elders to show a
 friendly spirit even towards an enemy               if met on the road, unless         he
 should appear to be bent on insolence,             in which      case high words are
to be   returned, and they are frequently followed by violenca
    It  is not necessary      to obtain permission           before   passing through
the territory      of another tribe    ;  and even    if travelling among       a hostile
tribe, a man      is unmolested unless         he himself provokes attack.
    When a man encounters            a   stranger on the road and is accosted by
him, he stands        in the usual position of          ease (the right foot resting
on the      left calf), with his bow and arrows in the left hand, and
talks    to him in a friendly manner, at the same time on the watch
for   lurking    enemies.      If  the traveller     prove to belong to a hostile
tribe,     and     become    insolent,       the   pleasant      tone     must   not     be
maintained       (it would   be taken       for cowardice or fear), but          he must
be met       with "flashing      eyes and angry         expostulation;" should           ho
wax more angry, and use           insulting language about the            man's mother,
a   fight is unavoidable.           In this      case    it is possible that others
(friends     of the stranger) will be in ambush near,                  and at    a  given
signal    will surround the       man, so that for a long time he must                  try
by great agility to avoid their arrows.                    There is    a  leaf which is
believed      to possess peculiar virtue, and           if any of it is at hand        tho
man     will endeavour to      seize some of the leaves and rub himself               with
them.       He then aims        at the stranger who accosted               him,    and    if
possible Bhoots him.          If  he is successful       in killing his    assailant,    he
may escape        if he please; but to          do  this is considered a disgrace
unless he has       killed his   enemy,     or at least one of his tribe.         Should
the     man be completely outnumbered, but contrive                       to escape, he
summons        assistance   by means of his horn, and then, reinforced by
others, returns to the scene of conflict, and should                     the enemy still
 be there, the fight is renewed.

332                     Proceedings     of  the  Royal Society
    It   is usual for young persons             to travel   over the surrounding
country often to considerable distances,                and   thus they acquire              a
 practical knowledge of the country, and without                  the help of mile
stones, sign-posts,       or other landmarks (all of which            are unknown),
they become expert in finding the way from place to place.
    Salutations.     — The modes of salutation coincide almost exactly
with our own — greeting being expressed by shaking of the hand
and kissing.         Members of      a  family kiss, but the boys shake hands
with their father         and  each other.        Husbands kiss their wives            and
 female     relations, and friends kiss each other.            Matutinal      greetings
are usual.       Great joy is manifested at the return of             a member of a
family from        a long absence, the brothers and sisters running out                   to
welcome       him;    and frequently a lamb is         killed  as   an expression of
joy, and great virtue is believed to be in the blood, some of which
is put upon the returned traveller.
    Swimming.      — Swimming        is practised by both men and women in
the   Madi tribe,      and tho art is acquired very early in life.            It   is put
to practical use by crossing rivers, fishing, &c.               They do not       take a
header     into tho water, but simply walk or jump in.                  Diving      is not
practised.       They swim      as a   rule hand over hand, and splash              about
and make        as   much noise      as  possible    to frighten     away   crocodiles.
Sometimes they carry children              on their backs when          in  tho water.
They      have   a habit     of taking in mouthfuls of water and                spitting
it out forcibly      when in the act of making a stroke.              On coming         out
of the water they rub themselves                all over with their hands,         to get
rid of    as much water as possible.           If  near home they rub themselves
witli oil after bathing.
    Bathing and Cleanliness.        — The Madis        bathe   each    day in    a rivtr
or other water near their homes            ;  small children wash themselves              at
home in largo        earthenware jars.        ~So   soap is used or any substitute
 for it.     They    have    no sponges.       They    always rub oil over            their
 bodies after each bath.          When they cut their nails, they             bury      tho
parings in the ground.
    Division of Labour. — In            the    division   of labour the       woman's
sphere is at home.          She may help at times in the lighter field               work
in  tho cool of the morning, but must return home before the middle
of tho day, the men continuing at work.                 If, however,     a woman Las
a  family of young children to look after, she seldom leaves                   home at

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                              333
all     Her duties are domestic         ; she  lights the fire, sweeps out tlio
huts, fetches water twice a day from the river or well, makes butter,
stores    the food in jars, and cooks, &c.         Children are early taught to
be useful    in helping their mother; and should she be ill, the husband
fetches the water, lights        the fire, and a neighbour         is called in for
aid, as the father cannot cook.            No    one is paid for such services
any fixed price, but some present           is  as  a rule given.       The women
attend sick persons with much solicitude.
   The man's work consists in hunting, fishing, agriculture, procuring
wood for bows and arrows, and firewood,                   lie partly makes the
bows, milks the cows, and sometimes               helps in making the butter.
The men also       build   the huts.      When removing from           one  place  to
another the men carry all the heavy things, as well as the roofs of the
huts, and fix them before they fetch the women.                 In hunting     expe
ditions the women carry water           in small jars for their     husbands.
   Riilhjion. — "With     regard    to the religious beliefs of the people,          I
have not been       able   to ascertain    much, their ideas being so vague
that a much longer sojourn             among them than        I   made     would be
necessary to discover what is really or partially believed by them.
They appear       to have an       undefined belief      in  a great     Being who
made     the  world and     men.      They also believe in       "isa" = the     soul
or thinking      part of man, which however perishes               with his body.
There is no belief       in  a resurrection     or after life for man, though
ideas and speculations on the subject are indulged in.
    The first man is said to have come from the sky, but departed
friends are thought of as being under ground, and their bod ies are
thought to turn into white ants, or to grow up as grass, mushrooms, &c.
    I  have been told that sometimes           people   imagine they hear their
departed friends speaking to them, and that when                  they look to    see
the   familiar forms nothing is visible but smoke.            When this     happens
there is a general lamentation           among the friends of the departed,
and a    lamb is killed and its blood is sprinkled on them all.
    One man, tradition says, dreamt that his " isa
                                                                 "
                                                                     (soul) left his
body sleeping, and went up to the sky.                It is a common thing for
lost friends to be seen       in  dreams, and to seem to turn into lions or
some     other object of terror.         However     vague   their notions      of a
Deity or of themselves as spiritual            beings may bo, they teach and
 practise very sound principles of good.

    A    good man          to them          is one who is brave and not afraid to fight
or die, who seeks the welfare of others, and is always ready to                                          show
kindness to them, who respects the aged, helps the sick and infirm,
and gives to those who are in need.
    Superstitions. — Among the superstitious practices in vogue in                                           the
Madi tribe, is the detection of guilt by ordeaL
    Three means of trial                      by ordeal are used, through                      which it       is
believed guilt can be detected.                           If   a man is accused of an offence
and denies          it,   he goes      with his      accuser to have the matter settled                       by
ordeal.
    In    one mode             of trial they both receive                   a     red feather of         great
value,       and have            to    bite     it   through.           This      is   considered          very
dangerous,          for after     a    few weeks the guilty one will fall                      ill   and die.
Unless very sure of their own innocency they rarely try this ordeal
    At other times              seed   is   given to be eaten, which will be innocuous
to the innocent,                but fatal to the guilty.                    Another       method       is     by
throwing        down small sticks of equal                          lengths.         In the    case     of    an
innocent man, the sticks                      will fall against            each    other, standing            up
like     the legs of       a    Gipsy table, whereas               a   guilty     man's sticks fall flat
Before any of theso trials the men look up and solemnly invoke
some       invisible           being to punish              him      if    guilty,     or help him            if
innocent.
    If   a   man     is    seen committing an                  injury and        does not deny         it,   the
injured person challenges                     him, and they fight until one                    is    killed   or
badly wounded.                  Sometimes the men of the village come                                together
and separate              them, and then             a   kind of rough trial takes               place, ami
the defaulter         is    obliged to make               restitution in kind, e.g.,            a    cow and
a   goat for    a    cow injured,           a   hut and        a   cow for   a    hut, &c.
    There are three classes of men who possess authority in villages
and districts.             Class A. preside               over ordeals       ;    class   B.   possess       the
power to try persons                      accused        of murder or any great crime                  ;    and
class     C,   perhaps         the most important of all, consists of the men who

    a   similar notion.
        Omens          are believed in.            One of the most common is sneezing ;
 it appears            to forebode good or evil, according to what is being said
 at the time,            producing a contrary effect to what is expected.                         Trip

the same               foot twice on the same day is a bad sign, once on each
foot is a good one.                    Some people consider one of their feet lucky,
one          unlucky.          It   is thought to be unlucky to return by the same
road          that a man goes by, both for long journeys                         and short walks ;
a    different route is always chosen when possible.
        Odi. — There appears              to be a belief         in the    existence      of elves or
spirits, though this would seem to be an invention of the female
doctors to gain a hold on the people.
                                      " Odi " is the name by which
these         beings are known.                   They arc supposed          to live underground,
and their help is sought                     in   cases of illness among children.
        If   a   child is ill, the lady doctor first examines                   it,   and then retires
to      a     quiet spot at          a    distance from the hut, where she erects                    a
miniature hut of sticks and grass.                           She   is   followed      to this place by
the mother              and     one of her        little boys, laden with       a     pot of food and
a   live fowl.                She then proceeds          to invoke       the Odi to appear, but
often gives             out that they cannot            come     till the next day, being busy.
At last they make their                       appearance       inside the small hut, but are
visible to none but the                           doctor, others    only hearing them speak.
Two usually appear,                   a   male and       a   female,     more    than that number
refusing to come at once.                     The doctor says they have human faces
and serpent's bodies.                     She pretends to give them food to eat out of
the pot, and asks their aid towards the sick child's recovery, shaking
all this time her magic                           wand or rattle.         When they have had
enough            food they vanish, and the doctor falls down right over the
small            hut      She strikes the ground with her hand, and appeal's to
have          a   fit, unconsciousness lasting               a   few minutes.           Before falling
she tells the mother and boy to run homo as fast as possible, and
shut the door.                  A    strong women         is   always present at this incanta-

    The Custom of      Killing a Lamb. —A remarkable custom is observe                    1
at stated times — once a year,        I am    led to believe.          I  have not been
able to ascertain what exact meaning is attached to it.                       It appears,
however, to relieve the people's minds, for beforehand they evince
much sadness,       and seem very joyful when the ceremony is duly
accomplished.
    The following is what takes         place   : —A     large concourse       of people
of all ages assemble, and sit down round a circle of stones, which U
erected by the side of a road (really a narrow path).                      A very choice
lamb is then fetched by a boy, who leads it four times round                          the
assembled      people.    As it  passes they pluck off little bits of its rleeco
and place them in their hair, or on to some other part of their body.
 The lamb is then led up to the stones, and there killed by a man
belonging to a kind of priestly order, who takes some of the blood
and sprinkles      it four times over        the     people.       Ho then applies      i:
individually.       On the children he makes a small ring of blood over
the lower end of the breast bone, on women                    and girls he makes         j
mark above the breasts, and the men he touches                       on each shoulder.
He then     proceeds    to explain the ceremony,           and to exhort the people
to show kindness, for example —
    If rich, not to deny a cow or sheep to a poor man that asks one.
If  eating,   not to appear unaware of            a   passer-by,     but invite him to
sharo   in  the meal.     If  children    see   a stranger,       they should run to
their mother for water to offer to him             ;  or  if they    see an  old woman
fall, they should not laugh, but give her              assistance.
    When this discourse, which is at times of               great length, is over, the
people rise, each places      a leaf on or by the circle of stones, and then
they depart with signs of great joy.               The lamb's skull is hung on          j
tree near     the stones, and its flesh is eaten by the poor.                  This cere
mony is observed on        a small scale at other times.               If a family is in

     any great trouble,            through illness or'bereavement, their friends anil
  neighbours              come together     and       a    lamb is killed; this is thought to
  avert further            evil.     The   same custom prevails                     at the grave of de
  parted friends,            and also on joyful occasions,                     such     as the return of a

          Harvest Feasts.         —Aharvest feast is held as soon as the corn has
                          and placed on the " langas
                                                     " to
  'wen reaped                                             dry.  It is then too that
  the general          holiday time commences                  ;   there is very          little work done
  from this          period until the rains begin, hunting, dancing, and fighting
  occupying the interval.
      The harvest feast is held                 in   each village, and is only attended by
 the       inhabitants of the place.                      It   takes      place      on the open           space
 which is            usually found in the centre                   of the village.               At   the con
 clusion        of the feast speeches are made.                           It   appears        that one man
 presides, and             after an opening speech by this president, women as
 well as men              address the company.                 The old people                 are listened    to
 with great respect,                and give advice to the young.                        The belle of the
 village is          reserved to make the last speech, after which all disperse.
      The enthusiasm evoked                 by       a favourite          orator or palatable senti
 ment is expressed                 by clapping of hands             ;    but weariness or impatience
is merely            shown by sullen looks, only those who are rude covering
Their faces           with their       hands.
      Music      — The Madis             are very fond                  of music, and have several
kinds of musical instruments                     — drums, harps, horns,                   and flutes.
      There are large and small drums.                             The small ones are made out
of    a   tree, the        trunk of which is              more      than       a   foot in diameter, and
their length              varies from 2 to 3 \ feet.                The block of wood is either
hollowed             out by fire, or more rarely by the knife.                                Pithon or goat
skin is          usually       fixed    over one           end      by means            of wooden pegs.
Sometimes,                however,      both ends          are covered,             and then the skins
are caught             together by long laces of. hide.                            The larger drums are
very different both as regards                       size and shape.                Logs of wood about
12    feet long are hollowed out, and placed on four wooden legs,                                           four
handles also               being cut out of the wood (see fig.                            1    3).    A   narrow
opening         is    left along the under surface of the block, and not covered
in.        The drum          is   beaten by large sticks, having                    a   somewhat globular
end.          All     drams are well wanned before use, and near the larger
one       a   fire   is   kept burning during its use.

      The    harps are made                as follows              :   — The half of              a    large    gourd
is     taken        and      two     round              holes          made       in    it,     into which          are
fitted two upright               6ticks, which                diverge         a   little from           each    other.
They are united above                     by   a    cross      bar, from           which strings made of
sinews or fibres are carried down, and passed through                                                   small holts
made  in the gourd, on the inside of which they are fastened to small
bits of wood. "When in use the gourd        placed against the belly      is
of the player, and so acts as                       a   kind of sounding                board.
      The flutes         are made out of hollow canes, having                                   eight holes and
a    mouth holo.           They are held as in Europe.                                 They also        use     rattles
made        of gourds, partly filled with dried dhurra or small                                                stones.
Small bows            are used as musical instruments.                                 They     are strung with
hair from        a   giraffe's     tail
                                      ;    one end of the bow                          is   placed against the
teeth, and then the string                     is   struck with           a    switch.
 I      fear   it   is   beyond my power to describe the music produced by
these instruments, but              I      can testify that on                    a     moonlight night the
melodies they give forth are very weird and yet sweet, and at times
fantastic.
      Dances.     — The harvest           feast      is      usually followed the next day by                         a
dance     — this being the first               danco of the season.                         One of the larger
villages     is   chosen as the scene of the dancing festivities,                                       which      are
held in     a    large open        space outside the                     village.           Great numbers           of
people assemble from the surrounding country                                      ;     and      as most       of the
inhabitants have to be present on these occasions,                                              often    only the
old and very young people are left behind in                                    a   village.          The holiday
makers aro accompanied by their cows, and these are left to graze
outside in the forest, boys remaining in charge of them.                                                   This     is
done as      a    precaution, for         if    the cattle were left unprotected,                               raidj
might be made on them by enemies.
     The band consists of                 a     large drum and several                          small ones sus
pended on         a   pole ;     horns and rattles are also used.                               The musician*
are    placed in the centre of the ground, being encircled                                                 by the
dancers.          The old         people present stand round                                the       ground,     and
clap their hands in time to the music.                                   The young           men are grouped
together and the young women placed opposite them.                                                    The married
women dance               together, and the married men in                                  a   group by thea-
selves.
     The dancing           is   chiefly from side to side,                         not forwards.               Some

    tim >, however,       a young woman dances across, and invites                  a young
    man to advance       into the centre and perforin          a pas seul     ; and when
    he has    finished, he    in his turn asks       a young woman to           exhibit her
   skill, hut they do not dance            together.     The men paint themselves
   with various colours        for these occasions,      and the women are adorned
   with brass necklaces, rings            on their waists, arms, and ankles, anil
   flowers    round their necks.
       Fights.   — These    dances are usually ended         with    a  fight  ;  in fact,  it
   seems     that the dance would           not be     supposed to havo gone               off
   properly without some such finale.               The fight is begun in this way           :
   A man shoots        an arrow high in the air, so that            it falls among the
  (lancers,     who immediately cease dancing, and range themselves into
  different sides,      according as is their division            of tribe.       Then the
  yame begins         by  a shower of arrows.          Ths women remain with             the
  men,    carefully eluding the arrows          ;  should,a man be hit, some of his
  female     relations rush up to him, carry him to a place of safety, and
  wash    his wound.         They    do not  try and    stop the bleeding, for fear of
 causing       inflammation.        Should    inflammation       occur,    light incisions
 are    made to     allow the blood to run freely.             A  special knife is used
 for this purpose.          Should     a  woman be killed, there is great excite
 ment,      and the fighting       becomes     desperate.      War     goes on between
 the    tribal divisions,      until  the offending one is considered to be suffi
 ciently punished, and pays a large indemnity                   in  cows.      If  no fight
ing is desired        at the dances, all the bows and arrows are hidden.
      Boys     are early taught by their fathers the art of war, especially
how to elude an enemy's               arrow.      This requires great dexterity and
much practice,         and young children are trained from very early days,
shooting at         their father with blunt arrows.              The young men          also
instruct large classes of boys, and mothers train                    their daughters in
 the art of       eluding   arrows.
      A3   in Europe, women          at times take a      dislike  to one another, and
very occasionally even come to blows.                   If they   do, a very fierce and
bloody encounter takes place,              for the women, before fighting, put             on
iron bracelets        with spikes both straight and curved projecting from
them; with these they tear one another very badly.                               The Arab
slave dealers do not appreciate these                  bracelets,    and when in their
raids they see a woman             with them      on, she is generally shot down at
once, for at close quarters the Arabs are no match for them.

 340                         Troceeaings         of the Royal Society
      Weapons.          — The     weapons       employed      in hunting are bows,                    arrows,
 and spears         ;   arrow heads have various shapes.
     Arrmcs. — The heads are made of iron, and are barbed and                                           orna
 mented.            Sometimes they arc poisoned for killing lions, &c.
     The shafts of the arrows               have a hole           made at the top by                   a red-
 hot iron      ;    into this the head is fitted and kept in place by fiat                               iron
 wire    ;    similar wire is also used to ornament the shaft.                              The       arrows
 are notched, but have no feathers.   The arrows used in war are                                        made
 of the hard wood of the " pi " tree. The barb is also made of                                         wood
sharpened           at both ends and fitted into the shaft.                      The end of               the
shaft is bound round with red string to prevent it splitting.                                              In
withdrawing             the arrow from a wound the head is left behind.
     Spear Heads.-— These               do not vary much in shape, but different
sizes        are made.           Very   large     heads      are used      for elephants.                The
women,         if    on a long journey,           carry small spears with ornamented
handles.            The spear shafts are tipped with an iron spike; both                               heads
and spikes have             a hole made          in them,         through which iron wire                  is
passed to fasten them firmly to the shaft.                           No blunt-headed                  arrows
are used, save those employed to instruct the children.
     When hunting or fighting, the left hand is protected by                                     a woven
string "gauntlet"; it                covers      the     palm of the hand and                     fingers,
the thumb being left free.
     Bows are made               of several       species     of wood.           The     strings          are
formed of twisted tendons.                       Sometimes         the bows are made quite
plain, others           are ornamented           by rings of crocodile skin, but                          the
middle of the bow is always left plain.                             One side of the bow                    is
generally flattened, and there is enough difference                            between          them for
each man to know his own.
     Animals        speared      or caught in pit-falls            are    as   follows      :   — Rhino
ceroses,       hippopotami,         giraffes.      Animals         shot   with arrows             :    lions,
gazelles,      wild     boars, leopards, foxes, elands, tetels, ostriches, buffaloes,
baboons.            Crocodiles are killed by            a barbed     spear, the iron head of
which has           a   line attached      to    it,   and   is   readily detached              from     the
handle       as soon as the        beast    is   speared.         Baboons are only attacked
by   a   number of men together;                 it    would be unsafe for a single                     man
to attempt it.            No     nets, palings, or trenches              are used      in   capturing
game.         There arc no firearms              in    the country.            Clubs are used;             a
favourite pattern           is   egg-shaped.

                               of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                     341
           Animals. — The jungles abound in                 wild animals,    the number           and
       variety of which afford a wide field of sport                    for the hunter, and          a
       choice    abundance of food        for the whole tribe.
           The following         animals    are     hunted,      and all except leopards,
      baboons, and       foxes are used as         food : — Elephants,      buffaloes,      gazelles,
      rhinoceroses,      hippopotami, crocodiles, wild boars, leopards, giraffes,
      elands, baboons, tetels,          rabbits,    porcupines, ostriches, guineafowls,
      wild ducks, pigeons,         and various other species             of beasts and birds
      which     I am   unable to identify.
           The animals        in a state of domestication are cattle, sheep, goats,
      dogs,     and fowls.        Fowls     are    fed    with   semsem      and dhurra.             A
      conical    stone house is made              for them     close    by the dwelling-hut,
      hut no porches           are provided.        The people keep         bees.          The hives
     are      made     of basket-work,         and fixed on the branches of                    a tree.
     The man who takes                 them up makes at the same time a sort of
     whistling       noise,    which    seems      intended      to be a call to the bees.
  A hole is left at the bottom of the hive to allow of the bees getting
  in, and        of the honey being subsequently taken out.                       To accomplish
  this a basket is pulled up, filled,                    and let down again, the use of a
  branch as a          pulley being evidently unknown.                   Sheep and goats aie
 kept in large numbers.                  Their     sheds have wooden walls             with thorns
 fixed on them, as a protection from hyenas, and they are roofed                                    in
 like the dwelling-hnts.
       Gazelles        and tetels are tamed              when caught young, the former
bsing fed on goats'                milk and the latter on           cows'   milk.       The tetels
are        kept for the purpose of milking.                   Eabbits     are tamed,        but not
very           successfully,      as    when      they are    full grown they generally
manage to escape.                 Eirds    are not kept        in captivity.       The domesti
cated dogs are                all smooth, and        do not vary much             in   size,     being
about as large as our fox terriers.                      In colour they     are    either white,
black, or brown, or black or white.                         They   are intelligent,        and show
much           affection and fidelity to their own masters.                    They are liable
to     hydrophobia,            and when seized with it are at once killed.                       There
i.s   also a         kind of wild       dog,   of smooth skin, reddish-brown                    colour,
and        a    fox-like head and long              ears.     Dogs are the only animals
which are trained.                 They prove of great             use in    hunting         gazelles,
buffaloes, and some small animals.
      Horses         are unknown,          and only very recently have                 a   few asses

342                       Proceedings    of the Royal Society
been     introduced by the Arabs.             There are no mule animals.             Cas
tration is not practised.
     Two kinds         of migratory     insects   visit  the  country.     When the
dhurra is ripe, green flies about              1£  inches long arrive in swarms;
many are caught and eaten, and the remainder take their departure
in the opposite direction from which they came.                  Swarms of      locusts
follow     them.       These are also eaten.
     ¦\Yhen    they leave,     a species    of small red bird takes possession           of
the    fields.     They build their nests in the trees near the fields                   of
th,e   dhurra, and remain until the com is too dry for them to                  eat.
     Once    a year the      white ants swarm      ;  when this is expected    a fire is
lighted near        the ant     hill,  the   ants are    knocked   down,     gathered,
preserved      in jars, and much relished          as food.   Fleas and mosquitoes
are very abundant.
     There is no worship of animals, and the people do not believe in
the interchange of souls between                men and animals.       There     exists,
however, some sort of superstition concerning one small bird                      called
" dadir."       It   is caught     when young, and small rings are            fastened
to its legs, after which         it is set freo, and no one is permitted to harm
it in any        way.       They think that it is unlucky          to hurt it      ; ami
should      a man     by accident break its leg, they expect one of his              cows
to got its leg broken.             The feathers      of another highly-valued          red
bird are used to try by ordeal persons                accused  of falsehood.         It   is
considered       to be a bad omen        if a gazelle crosses   a man's     path   ; and
if it should       occur, the man         usually turns back and gives up his
project, whatever it may bo.                 The lizard is known, and no          one is
 allowed to      kill   it.
     Various curious legends prevail with regard to animals.                      I   will
 mention one       as a specimen.
     A   monster      lion is said to have shaken the earth            by his       roars.
 The shock was           so great   that all the people fell to the ground,           and
 the lion proceeded          to oat them.       One   man, however, entreated           the
 Being, who had created              both man and beast, to make            the lion       a
 little smaller,     as he was too great       and powerful for men     ;  his  request
 Wits granted,      and the lion forthwith was reduced in size to his                 pre
 sent dimensions.
     Among numerous fables, the following may be given                   : —

  enjoy      themselves.            Soon,       however,       they       found           that    they were
  encircled       by men, who set fire to the grass on                          all   sides.      The rabbit
  was most        officious    in proposing plans of                 escape.          One of his sugges
 tions was that         the weasel          (?)   should make         a   hole in the ground, into
 which they         might all flee for refuge.                 When the danger                    came quite
 near, he forgot        every one else in his endeavours to save himself, but
 without avail,        for they          were     all burnt up except the                  weasel (?), and
 a   small bird who had been on the watch, and who, as soon as bo
 saw the danger,         warned his friends, and then flew away.                                  The rabbit
 came     to his end as follows                 : — The    weasel         (?)   had taken his advico
 and dug      a   hole in the ground, into which he entered, but the rabbit
 bit off his       tail and pulled him out, getting into the hole himself.
 In revenge, the weasel                 told the men where the rabbit was, and as
 they looked          for him the           weasel      managed           to make good bis own
 escape.
     Hunting. — The hunting season                        is   a    very important               time in the
Madi country, for               it      immediately follows              a   period of agricultural
labour, and finds              the people ready for the enjoyment of                              a   holiday,
and     of   a   sport which they keenly appreciate.                             When the corn             is   all
dried and          stowed away in the granaries, the hunting begins, and
continues         for several months — that                    is,    until the rain             commences
again.       Very large hunting parties                   are formed, people from numerous
villages assembling together, and being sometimes                                      joined by parties
from other         friendly tribes.
     The following            is   the way in which the notice of                     a   hunt   is   given   : —
A    man     is   sent round to all the villages, and as he passes by each
hat he strikes          with        a   peculiar stick one of the stones by the door
of the hut.           This signal          is   followed       by    a   formal declaration that                  a
hunt    is   arranged for           a   given day, and that all who wish to take part
are to     meet at     a   given place.              When the time                has arrived, and the
hunters assembled, they divide into companies,                                    and encircle         a   tract
of   country often several                  miles in extent.               One company takes up
its position on the side from                       which the wind blows, and                     sets fire to
the long grass; as             it    is   burnt down, the animals rush towards the
other companies, who stand in long double rows, shooting their
prey as they pass by. If buffalo happens to be amongst the fugi
                                            a
tives, he        usually proves           an awkward customer, as instead of                           running
straight forward he                 will    rush into the ranks of his foes, and cause

344                          Proceedings of the Royal Socicti/
no little commotion, often             killing or wounding several of the hunts
men.        When        an    animal is killed, it is the prize of the man who
first shoots      it,   though its death         is   probably accomplished by                      others.
     The right of possession                does not appear             to be decided               by   dis
tinguishing       arrow marks, but great care                      is   taken to identify                 the
shooter,      and quarrels often arise                   about       it,    and are          frequently
only settled by          a    fight.   It   is   virtually     a   case     of mujh ado              about
nothing, for this right, which                is   so   jealously guarded,                concerns only
the tail or the horns of the animal, which are kept as                                        a    trophy.
Any     one who has taken part in                  a    hunt has        a       perfect    right     to his
share in the booty, which              is    shared      alike by all, each man getting
an almost      equal part of the spoil.                  Even should one party                 be more
successful       than another,         the unlucky             hunters get the              same      share
as   those who have been successful.                      Should an animal be first                      shot
with    a   borrowed bow and arrow, the lender gets the trophy                                       ;   but
such transactions only take place between                          brothers or very intimate
friends.      Successful hunters are long                      kept        in    remembrance,            ami

     The Madis          do     not appear        to have any            special           ceremonies or
dances connected              with their hunting expeditions, but in subsequent
dances, those who have been distinguished in hunting, or                                           women
who have been very active in giving water to the men and won
special renown, are celebrated                in      song.     No      great      feast takes place
after   a   hunt, but friends are sometimes                     invited in small parties                   U>
eat buffalo,     &c.
     Before going to the hunt               the men paint their faces in stripes                           of
different colours, and put iron rings on their necks, arms, and                                     (some
times) ankles,          and    the white tail of some animal round their neclis.
They carry their arrows in              a    goat-skin bag, hung over the shoulder
or by   a   string which passes round the neck.                          In      the left hand they
hold the bow and two or three arrows; in the right hand they                                          carry
the spear.       They start very early,               so as to reach the            hunting ground
soon after sunrise, and they hunt all day.                           The women              start     later,
carrying water on their heads in earthen jars, in the neck of which
bunches       of leaves are placed               to     keep    the water           cooL      A       small
gourd floats on the top of the water to keep                               it    from spilling,          and
serves as    a   drinking-horn.
     These large hunting parties                 are only undertaken in the                       hunting

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                             34.'
  season,    but individuals hunt at other              times.    Young    peoples  and
  children     hunt rabbits,     gazelles,   &c,    not,  far from home.       Women
  catch    guineafowl by driving them about, as they soon get tired and
  cannot     fly far.     Sometimes large       companies of boys undertake            a
  hunt for the old women.             On their return they all walk together in
  regular order to the huts where the old women live, laden                   with  the
  spoil,   and for this good work they are always invited                   to dinner.
  Should      the old women have too much meat brought to them, they
 make      presents to their friends.
    All the wild uninhabited land surrounding                 a tribe belongs to the
 tribe as a whole, and may be hunted               in by   anyone.     Individuals or
 parties may also hunt         in  the country which belongs to a neighbour
 ing tribe,     if that tribe is friendly.        Should a man go alone to hunt
 in an     enemy's country, he will not         be interfered with,     if he behaves
 well    ; but   if he be insolent, the people will fight with him.
    The      chiefs    do not    often take part in the hunt; possibly              tho
 people do not        like them     to be needlessly exposed ; and there is a
 tradition of a great chief having been killed in a hunting fray, and
his body having been lost
    Gazelles are hunted as follows            : — Some of the       dogs run   in front
 of the animal to distract its attention, whilst two or three creep
 quietly up from behind, and seize it.                  The dogs are kept by indi
viduals, and not in large packs.
    All     large animals     are cut up when        killed, and not carried away
whole.         There is much waste, as what cannot be easily taken away
is left.       Small    game is carried home on the head, or slung on a pole
and carried by two men.
    The Madis are very skilful with bow and arrow, and can hit
birds on the wing.              No tribute is paid in game. Water only is
drunk while hunting.              The meat is dried over a fire to preserve it.
    The      people    are not influenced       to migrate by the habits of the
animals they hunt           ; good land is their great desire.
     Traps. — The various         modes    employed for entrapping animals are
of interest.
     Hippopotami and rhinoceros are caught in pits.                    Deep holes are
dug in the ground, into the bottom of which wooden                   stakes are driven
witti      spikes   projecting from the upper end, and then the holes are
covered        over  with sticks and       grass, strong enough to bear          a man's

weight, but unable              to sustain large                animals, which, falling in              are
often killed by the spikes, or at least badly wounded.
      Buffaloes are caught by means of                      a    skin rope attached             to a pole
which is stuck into the ground                      ; at    the end of the rope there                   is a
noose, which is arranged                 round a small hole dug in the ground                       ;   the
rest of the rope is hidden by twigs and leaves.                                 The buffalo puts his
foot into the hole, and in getting it out the noose is drawn tight,
and        the animal has to            drag    the heavy pole.                 He is thus         easily
tracked and speared.
      To trap guineafowl,           a   string is made of hair from                     a cow's tail, a
noose is placed             among       the small branches of a low plant in                        then-
run, into this they run their heads and are held fast.
      Another     trap is made of a long basket with                        a    narrow opening at
one end.         It    is placed        on the ground in one of the narrow paths
running        through the high grass;                   small animals find their way into
it,   but cannot get out again,                as    the twigs           of which       the basket        is
made are so arranged               inside that they fly back from the sides and
prevent the animal retreating.
      Birds are caught in the following ways                         —
                                                                     :
      1.   A   noose   is   attached      to   a    bent bough, and so arranged                     as to
spring back and snare any bird that touches it.
      2.   One end of       a   flat stone     is   placed on the ground, and the other
supported by a stick to which                       is   tied   a   piece of string.         The birds
being attracted          to food placed underneath the stone,                         pull   the string,
and the stone falls on them.
      3.   A   number of sticks are driven into the ground, and                                    nooses
fastened        to them     ;   dhurra    is   then scattered about, and as the birds
scratch the ground they get their legs caught.
      String traps are arranged                at the doors of the              fowl huts        to catch
the    wild     cats when they try to steal the poultry.
      At night boys         are very fond of catching rats by firelight                      ;   they lie
flat on the floor, very still, holding                     a     round pan with dhurra in                 it,
the rats come to eat, and as soon as near enough an inverted jar                                          is
quickly put over them.
      Finhimj.   — The Madis adopt various methods of fishing.
      Sometimes they dive into the water and while swimming under
neath stick the fish             with     an iron hook           ;   a   line   is   fastened    to this,
the one end of which              is    wound round the fisher's hand, with which

 he also holds the        wooden handle.            The hook     looses from the handld
 and remains       in the fish, the man then swims to land and hauls it in.
       Sometimes they fish at night               by firelight, shooting the fish with
 iron-headed arrows.            Nets     are also used.       They       are drawn across a
river and held at both              ends.         Men   go up stream,          and then swim
down with a splashing             stroke driving the fish to the net                    In this
way large       numbers are caught, and a general distribution                      of the spoil
takes place.
     These are the methods employedin catching very large fish. A
smaller kind of fish is caught by the women in shallow water.
They use a poisonous fruit, about the size of a gooseberry.    This
fruit they grind          into a coarse powder, and carry to the'water in
baskets.        They then scatter it on the              surface,        and the fish eat          it,
and soon        die.     They   are afterwards collected            in   baskets,     and   as    the
poison     is   not injurious to men, they are good for food.                   Children also
fish     by   shooting with bow and arrow, and swimming                         after the fish
they    hit; many lives        are lost through boys venturing into rapid rivers.
     Sometimes         in small rivers, instead of       a   net,   a    wickerwork         barrier
is     constructed across         the stream; another movable                    one    is       then
introduced up stream,              and gradually         carried down until             a     short
distance from the first barrier               ;   the fish thus brought together are
then caught        by hand, and thrown on to the bank.
     A   fish trap       is   also made of wooden            latticework,           several feet
across    at one end and narrow at the other                 ;   this     is   placed beneath
waterfalls or below rapids.                   Sometimes nets like our landing nets
are     held under waterfalls,           to    catch the fish as they come                   down.
"Wooden dams are also erected across rivers.                        Poles are fixed in the
ground and cross beams fastened                   to them, holes being left of such                 a
size    that the fish in trying to get through stick fast and are collected
each     morning.         These dams are left until the river gets swollen by
the rains, and washes            them away.
     Fish     are cured    by being dried by the fire or in the sun, and keep
good     for considerable        time.
     Manufactures
                  — Woodwork. — Numerous                         articles       are    manufac
tured from wood.                Ladles, stools,      handles for agricultural               imple
ments, bows, arrows, and walking-sticks.                      Nails       are not used,           bu
the articles       are either cut out             of blocks of wood, or tied together
with      string, leather thongs, or iron wire.                     The instruments               em

ployed are — knife, axe, and                   a   kind of              plane.     Fire is     also used    to
hollow out wood and to harden it.
     Smelting. — A hut or shed is set apart for carrying on smelting
operations, several men working in the same hut.                                           A    number      of
fires are kept going, and the bellows                             are used as follows:           —A     large
earthenware bowl            with        a hole at                 the    side near the bottom               is
placed near the fire, and a clay pipe is constructed from this hole to
the fire.        The top of the bowl is covered with                               a   soft skin, in       the
middle of which            a hollow            stick         is    fastened.           This stick       being
moved       up and down,          and tire top being closed                            by a finger      when
moving down, causes the draught.                              The anvils and hammers                    used
are of iron, the hammer being flat in shape.                                     They are thus       a little
in    advance     of the surrounding                tribes, who only use stone.                         Some
few stone anvils and hammers                           are, however,              still in     use in the
Madi tribe.        Very good knives, hoes, and bracelets are constructed,
as well as arrow-heads.
     The smelting furnaces are conical in form, and about                                      5 feet high,
layers of iron ore and charcoal                    being placed alternately.                      Six   pairs
of bellows are often used, each man working                                       two, one with         each
hand.       There is not very much beer drinking during the smelting,
but     a good    deal   of singing, the men working in time to the                                     song.
Relays of men work at this tedious operation.
     Banket   Work.    — The manufacture of baskets                              is carried on largely.
Various       shapes     and sizes         are constructed                     of open       wickerwork          ;
they are made by men much after our own manner.
     Baskets of dhurra stalks are woven by women in the following
way :— The pulp is removed,                    the stalks opened out flat and cut into
the requisite lengths.            The bottom of the basket is first made,                                and
the sides worked up from            it,   being woven very close.                         Some kinds        of
baskets are so closely made that they                             will hold milk, and small              ones
are made to servo          as    cups     on       a   journey,           as    they are lighter than
earthenware,      and less fragile than gourds.                                The shapes vary, being
round, square,         or otherwise, and of different colours, according                                    to
the kind of dhurra stalk used.                         Sometimes the various colours                       are
blended.        Women      also    make            baskets         of young doleb palm               leaves,
l'ots   are covered by    a     loose wickerwork                   for carrying.         Spring baskets
are made       by men.      Thoy arc chiefly used for ornamental purposes,
and not of much practical               use.

 women.          A   grey clay having been freed from stones is mixed                                     with
 water       to the consistency of dough;                    much care is taken that there
 should be no lumps                 in   it,   and that    it   should not be too wet or too
 dry.        This dough         is   left in     a   hut for      a   day, being placed on and
 covered       by leaves.            The women then commence to make the jars,
 forming the bottom first on                     a   wooden tray, working the sides up
 with their hands and moulding                         it    into shape.           No wheel          is   used.
 The vessels made vary very much                             in   size     and shape.          Some are
 round and open            like our basins,            some have narrow necks widening
 out again         at the top.            When formed they are ornamented by lines
made     horizontally and at right angles                         below the top rim, which                   is
often made to curve over.                         This marking            is   done with     a    sharp bit
 of   stone such as        is    for cupping, or with sharp pointed stick.
                                used                                       a
The jars are           then painted black, or black with  red neck. They          a
are    left in     a   hut for day or two to dry, then put in the sun for a
                                     a
day or two more, and lastly they are fired.                                Quite   a   trade     is   carried
on      by   the makers of pottery, who keep                          a   store    of their goods for
sale.        Some very large               sized jars are made                 for holding        semsein     ;
these are      made by men, and in forming them                              a   grass mould         is   used.
     Painting.     —The         Madis      decorate their bodies               with paint for         dances,
washing       it   off again when the festivities                 are over.           Red, blue, white,
and black paints                are used.         The red       is   oxide of iron, the black                is
made     from charcoal.               The paint       is   applied with the finger in stripes
about half         an inch broad on the face, arms, shoulders, and chest.
Women paint their faces, chest, and upper part of their arms, and
some     confine the paint to one part of the body only.                                     The designs
vary    with     taste.        No application          is   made to the eyes.             They        do not
stain their nails.
     String.   — String         is       made    from the fibrous bark of five or six
different      trees.      This       substance       is    first dried in the sun for                 a   day
or two, then wetted, and buried                        for two or three weeks, at the end
of which time             it   is   taken out and heaped                  up under       a   tree.        Here
the men        work, beating the fibrous pulp with piece of wood on the   a
smooth        trunk of tree which lies on the ground. They then work
                           a
the fibres      into string by rubbing them into                         a   twist with their hands
on their thighs.
  To make cord, they fasten two                            pieces of string to their toes, and

350                     Proceedings of tlie Royal Society
twist tliom together           with their hands, repeating           the    process until
the cord is of the required thickness and                  length.       In  making     rope
a cord     is tied between        two trees, and others wound round it in                     a
spiral manner.
     String is made of various other substances               — of  the hairs from the
cow's     tail, of animal skins cut into stripes and twisted (these                        are
very strong, and are used for trapping buffaloes); also from                               the
tendons       of cattle and wild animals           ;  this kind is made very             finp,
two men being needed                to work it.        It  is used     for bow      strings.
 String is also made from doleb palm leaves.                   Fishing      nets are made
 with fibre strings, which             is tied into knots by the hand, forming
 diamond-shaped meshes like our own netting.
     No   dye is used        in making string, but it is sometimes of a                    red
 colour, because        made with ted fibres.              No wax is used in              this
  manufacture, but the string is sometimes nibbed with                         grease.        A
 lump of fat is taken            in   the hand,     and the string drawn rapidly
 through it.       This    is also done      to the bow strings and nets, but not
 to the large       ropes.      As  a   rule, men make the ropes, and             nets, and
  bow strings; but women make fine twine, and small nets for holding
  gourds,    and for forming bags on which to hang up                   fruit, &c,    to dry
  in the sun, or from the rafters of the huts.
     Money. — A regular system               of exchange     is carried on       in  arrows,
  beads, bead necklaces,          teeth necklaces,      brass   rings for the neck and
  arm,    and bundles of small pieces of iron in fat, round, or oval
  discs.     All  these different articles are given           in  exchange       for  cattle,
  corn, salt, arrows, &c.
      The nearest approach           to money,    in   one sense, is seen in the flat
  round pieces of iron, which are of different sizes from                      i to   2     feet
   in diameter,      and     §  inch     thick.      They are      much employed               in
   exchange.
      This   is the form in which they are kept and used as money, hut
   they are intended to be divided into two, heated and made into
   hoes.    They are also fashioned into other implements, such                   as knives,
   arrow heads,     <fcc., and    into little bells to hang round the waist                   for
   ornament,     or round wandering cows' necks.
      Ready-made hoes aro not often used in barter                        ; iron as     above
   mentioned      is preferred,        and   is taken to      a   blacksmith       to   finish
   a xording to the owner's           requirements.

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1883-81.                           351
     Any tools may be obtained ready made from               a smith, and may be
   used  in barter when new.
     Compensation      for killing   a  woman or for any serious crime must
  be paid     in cattle.    No cowries      are used    as coin  in this district.
  Xo drawing or writing is known,              but certain marks are used to
  distinguish    between arrows, pots, and the like.
     Measures.   —A     year is made      up of twelve months or divisions,
  but the number of days        in  each   division    is said to vary — I could
  not make out how or why.
     A  day is from sunrise to sunset.          The year begins about      the first
 month of harvest, when the grain is quite dry.             Distance is reckoned
 by time.
    If you    ask the distance to       a  place not very far away, they will
 often point     to the sky and say — " When the sun is at that spot
 you may be there."
    No measure of weight, quantity, or length is used.
    The number of cows given to           a son,  or the number of things lent
 or borrowed, is remembered            by  means    of small lengths of grass,
 bundles     of which     are  kept in     a  basket on the wall of the hut.
 Dried beans are sometimes          used for the purpose.
    The Madis count by tens       ;  hundreds are known, but not thousands.
 Sticks are sometimes notched to remember numbers.
    Astronomy. — The twilight in this district is very short.           The Madis
divide the day into three parts — morning from about 5.30 to 10 A.M.;
mid-day     10 to 3 p.m.; and afternoon         from 3 to 6.30     p.m.   So that,
roughly speaking, sunrise and sunset begin and end the day.                    The
names     for sunrise and sunset       are kadro-ersa,   kadro-lobo.     There are
names too for several of the stars             (calu).    The Pleiades,     Minge
Minge.       The larger    star  by which they tell the time, Toru.            The
milky way, Guguree (road).
   Their study of the stars does not seem to go further               than giving
names to       some   of them.        The winds     are   called Bluku.      East,

    I consider that     these notes would be far from complete           were    I to
 omit some mention of the Madi language.              I  have, therefore,      given

 rich and melodious, and apparently lends itself well                to  oratory and
 song.     It  belongs   to the Negro group of languages,           for the Madis
 are pure negroes.
     Note. — I Lad at first intended to illustrate this paper with drawings from
 objects in my collection, which are interesting as being the only ones that
 have yet found their way into Europe.            Finding, however, that somewhat
 similar articles may be found depicted in Ocschkhtc dor Waffen, Band iii.,
 Berlin und Leipzig, 1877, and in Schweinfurth's Artes A/ricaiue, Sampson
 Low, 1875, this has been deemed unnecessary.

that some of them, and more especially the Comatulce,                     should be
briefly noticed before the larger report can be published.
    My friend Professor L. von Graff               has  kindly   sent   me a short
account     of the  Myzostomida, from which it will             appear     that four
species    of these    parasites     have    been   added    to the    two already
known in the British        seas.

    The detailed zoological results of the preliminary dredging expe
ditions of the
                    " Lightning " and the " Porcupine," in the years
1868-70, have been so completely cast into the shade by the mag

35-4                   Proceedings      of (he Royal Scci"ty
nificent collections of the         " Challenger," that little      is known about
many of the deep-sea animals obtained by these expeditions beyond
the first references     to them      in tho reports of Sir Wyville Thomson,

    The    Annelids, Corals, Echinids,          and Mollusca      soon   found their
way into able hands, and have been fully described in the publica
tions of various learned societies.            But  as regards most of the other
groups    no detailed results have ever been published.                This  want of
systematic information          about our earlier expeditions          is not to be
wondered at, when it is remembered                that tho "Challenger"         sailed
                                                                                       :'
but little more than two years after the return of the "Porcupine
from the Mediterranean, and that Sir Wyville                   Thomson, in      whose
hands the collections mostly remained,              was  in   bad health, with his
time much occupied by his professional duties and by the                     prepara
tions for his four years' absence.             When    he returned the "Porcu
pine" collections were entirely dwarfed by those of the "Challenger;"
and it is only now that they have been examined by Mr Murray
that specimens       dredged      nearly fifteen years      ago are     coming    into
the hands of specialists,         who are working        them up together         with
the "Challenger"         material, and with that of the           "Knight Errant''
(1880) and     "Triton" (1882).
    Nearly the same thing has taken place on tho other side of                      the
Atlantic, little being       yet   known about many of the types obtained
by the U.S. ships "Corwin,"             "Bibb," and "Hassler" (1803,             1869,
1872)   ;  and they are now being described by those specialists,                     in
                                          the larger collections of the " Blake

no means complete,        as   regards either the list of species obtained            or
their geographical distribution          ;  and in the following pages      I propose
to partially     make    good    this deficiency.      When our knowledge              of

   which were      new to European         seas and also       new to science,   while
   one represents a      new generic type altogether         ;  and among the seven
   Comalula species were         three or possibly four new forms, one repre
   senting a genus     which, up      till very lately,   has scarcely  been    known
   to occur  outside the limits of the tropics.             Sir Wyvillo Thomson's
  list embraces       only   seven   species    of Crinoids altogether ; whereas
  eleven    different types were really obtained, 6evon being Comatidir,
  and four    stalked Crinoids, the latter including three additions to the
  four species then known.
      These facts seem to me of sufficient interest to merit being treated
  separately,     so that    they may not be lost sight of in the general
             of the Crinoids which will appear in the " Challenger

    Remarks.      — So     far as my information goes, this widely distributed

                                         in    1869.             But according            to    Sir Wyville. f
"   several    occurred      attached              to the beards of the Hultenice off the
Butt of the Lews."               This would                    be at Stations 47 and 90, both of
them      close to No.          xii. of       the       "Lightning"             cruise,        which        was     the
original Holteuia-gvound, and was described                                 by Sir Wyville                 as being
in the Faeroe            channel.         There           is,    however,        no mention of                 Rhizo-
crinus in      the accounts              of the dredgings at these stations, either                                   in
The      Depths     of    the     Sea,        or    in    the Royal         Society Report                 ;   and   I
suspect therefore          that Sir Wyville was speaking from memory                                              only,
and confounded the dredgings of the two years.   At any rate,                                                  if   the
" Porcupine " did obtain
                         specimens on the Holtenia-groxmd in                                                      18G'J,
they have since disappeared.
  Sir Wyville mentioned individuals of considerable size as having
been dredged by the
                     " Porcupine " in 862 fathoms off
                                                       Cape Clear.
They really belong, however, to the species which three years                                                      later
was met with off Barbadoes                     by the

      Remarks.     — These four       specimens,     as  already indicated, were really
  the first   discovered examples           of R. rawsoni; but they differ from
  R. lo/otevsis      far   less than the Caribbean            individuals     do.*    ,Thoso
  from    Station 42 were noticed by Sir              Wyrille      at the time they were
  obtained, and described as unusually                large examples of       R. lofotensis.
  But   I  am not aware that he ever made a closer examination of them.
 After reading Pourtales'              description      of the Caribbean       R.   raicscmi,
 I   came    to the conclusion that the              "Porcupine"         specimens    should
 really be referred to this type            ;  and this view was confirmed when
 the    originals      of Pourtales'      description were sent to            me last year
 (1882), as      I  have pointed out in my " Blake" report.
      The two young            individuals     from Station 43 seem to have been
 altogether       overlooked      ; for   they are       not mentioned either in the
 Royal Society's Report, The Depths of the Sea, or the paper on
 "                  " Crinoids.
     Porcupine                         They did not come into my hands until
 August last,          having     been    discovered by        Mr Hurray among Sir
 Wyville's       collections      at the   University.         They     are the    youngest
specimens of this type which                 I  have    seen.     Each has 28 joints in
the stem, from the calyx to the                 root  ;  but its length, which is only
20 mm.       in the smaller, is         24-5 mm.      in the larger individual.           The
majority of the joints are cylindrical and elongated,                          only a very
few at the           base    of the stem showing            the characteristic      dice-box
shape     with expanded           ends.    The length of         the calyx is almost the
same      in both       specimens,     1*8 mm. ; though          its diameter across the

  radials is greater         in that which has the longer stem.                It  is mainly
  composed of the basals, which                 are   1*2   mm.     in height,     and form
 a   nearly cylindrical         tube,    at the top of which are the short radials,
 having       a more     decided upward and outward slope.                 This   causes the
 calyx to appear            slightly    constricted at the level of the basiradial
 suture,     a   feature     which    is very marked         in   some    varieties of       the
 adult form.
      As    compared        with   equal sized      specimens     of Ii.  lofotensis,     these
 young individuals of R. rawsoni are distinguished by the relatively
 great     height of the calyx in proportion to its width, the length of
 the basals, and the expansion of the calyx at the basiradial                          suture.
 The basals         of   R. lofotensis (uppermost stem-joint, Sara.) have a
 smaller share in the formation of the cup, and it expands uniformly
 upwards from the stem to the upper margin of the radials.
      It is noteworthy that even these two young individuals                        from tbe
 same locality present differences               in the shape of the calyx such               as
 are more distinct in adult specimens                 from different localities in          the
 East and West Atlantic.                 Perrier's genus     Democrinus *       is founded

                             of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                         359
     "Porcupine"         Crinoids.     This, however, is not quite        accurate,   for
     there is no    mention of any calyx-plates below the radials, the lower
    portion   of the head being said to consist         " of  a gradually    expanding
    funnel-shaped piece,         which   seems to be composed of coalesced        upper
    stem-joints."        Subsequently,      however, Sir    Wyville found that in
    B. aldrichianus, from the Southern Sea, there is               " a series of basals
    which are soldered together into a small ring, scarcely to be distin
    guished    from the upper stem-joint."*             The existence of basals       in
   Ilycrinus {Bath ycrinus) carpenteri was also recognised by Daniels-
   sen & Koren, t who were fortunately able to see the interbasal
  sutures    in young individuals,         though they entirely disappear in the
  adult ; and there is a similar basal ring              in B. gracilis, intervening
  between      the radials and the numerous thin 'joints at the top of the
  stem.
      The two outer radials and the two lowest brachials of B. gracilis,
  and also of         B. aldrichianus,      were  described by Sir      Wyville   as re
  spectively united          by  syzygy,   while Danielssen and Koren made the
 same     statement respecting B. carpenteri.              In all    these cases, how
 ever, the      supposed syzygy is really a modification               of the ordinary
 bifascial      articulation      permitting lateral movement only, which is so
 common        in the Comatula, and is           also characteristic of four species
 of Pentacrinus           ; for  a third and smaller bundle of fibres is inserted
 into a deep pit at the lower or dorsal end of the vertical articular
 ridge on each joint-face.             Externally, this form of articulation looks
 very much         like    a syzygy, as the    joints are brought      into closer con
 nection      than when they are united by a pair of muscular bundles.
 But a glance at their terminal faces is sufficient to show that the
 plainness        of     Pentacrinus     or Rhizocrhius,    or the striation    of  the
 Comatula-syzygiea is altogether absent,                and that they are marked
by distinct ridges and fossa;.
     According to Sir Wyville's description, there are none of these
                               "
so-called " syzygies in the arms of B. gracilis beyond that between
the first        two joints      ; while   in B. aldrichianus     there is    a  syzygy
between the fourth and fifth brachials, and at irregular intervals
                           but the  " alternate syzygies in the     arms, which form
beyond them            ;

their descriptions.         In  the    nine lowest brachials there are alterna
tions of a pair of joints united trifascially,                 and a single joint with
muscular attachments at each end                 ;   while beyond the ninth brachial
the two forms of articulation alternate with great regularity.                            The
presence of this trifascial articulation,                and its peculiar distribution
may therefore be considered as characteristic of Bathycrinm ; and

them have little stumps on their terminal joints, which give                            them
the appearance      of bifurcation, just as at the growing points of the
arms of young Couiatididx               and Pentacrinidx         ; and      I see no reason
 to doubt that these stumps are the commencing pinnules.

 type,   and probably, therefore,           to be referred to the Mediterranean
 variety of Aid. romcea.              It  is    impossible to state now the              exact
 depth from which           they were collected, but               it  was probably         not

Bay of Benzert, specimens of all ages coming up on the tangles in
great numbers,      though unfortunately            in  a   very   much mutilated
condition.      These were noticed by Sir Wyville Thomson in                            the
following     passage   :
                           * — " Many      examples     of the     form       known       to
Continental naturalists under the name of A. mediterranetu, Lam.
sp., were    dredged    in    the   Mediterranean off the coast of Africa.                 I
do    not feel satisfied       that this is identical with AnteJon               rosaceiu
of the coast of Britain, though the two specific                 names      are usually
regarded    as  synonyms.         There is a great difference      between them in
habit, a difference which it is difficult to define."              It   is curious that
 the extreme     length of the dorsal cirri of these individuals did                    not
 lead   Sir Wyville       to identify them       with Ant. phalangium             (celtica,
 Barrett), of which this is one of the special marks,                   as   he himself
 points out.      But  I   am strongly inclined        to believe that he is right
 in differentiating the common Mediterranean type from the British
 Ant.   rosacea.    As pointed out          above,   however, the "Porcupine"
 only got a very few young specimens              of it on the African         coast.
    It is singular that while no parasitic Myzostoma occurred                       among
 the numbers of Ant. phalangium dredged                on the Tunis coast, some of
the individuals     obtained in the Minch in 1869, and                   at Station       13
in  1870 (off Mondego)            proved to be the hosts of           a   new      species,

further on.       A single example of another new species, M. pulvinar,
 was also found attached            to the   peristome     of one     of    the     Minch

host to the same species of Myzostoma as occur on Ant. rosacea.

identity of the two can hardly be doubted.*                                             The adoption of his
specific      name       thus     becomes            inevitable,         however undesirable                           this
may seem         to European             naturalists, who have been so long accus
tomed to associate              the type with the name of a deservedly honoured
Norwegian zoologist.
     Sir Wyville Thomson                   gave       no definite list of stations for this
species, though           he mentioned the occurrence                               of more or less com
plete specimens or fragments                         in nearly every               one of the deep hauls
of the dredge from the Faeroe Islands to Gibraltar.                                               So far      as   I    am
aware, its southernmost                 limit in the East Atlantic, and                           also its lowest
bathynietrical           range     are at present united in Station                                     17a    of the

fathoms       in the "cold              area   "in      the previous year; but the U.S.

New England coast.
     Sir Wyville Thomson                 stated       that one or two small examples                                    of
the pentacrinoid           were      procured in the Faeroe channel.                                     Only      one,
however,        has come into              my hands.            It       is    a    trifle more advanced
than that       represented             Ly Sars in figs.             9   and        11    on Tab.        V. of his
classical     Memoires.           The       arms       are longer, with                       the first pinnule
on    about the twelfth                 joint.        There      is,     however, but one cirrus,
which seems to be the only one as yet developed, though                                                   it       is   of
considerable       size, reaching up to the level of the radial                                          axillaries.

    Sir Wyville Thomson stated that considerable numbers                              of this
 species     were      obtained      in many        of the   cold area hauls; and             he
 noted their small size as compared                   with more northern         specimens.
 No. 57, however, is the only station of which any record                           has been
 preserved; and it is interesting as being by far the greatest                           depth
 at which       this species has yet been met with.                   Its usual      parasite
 Myzostoma        yi;/<rs}   Liitken, MS.,       was also obtained at this station.
    Two pentacrinoids besides               that of Ant. dentata were dredged in
 the   cold area       ;  but     I  do not     think that either of         them     can     be
 the one       referred to         by Sir Wyville         Thomson      in the      following
passage:     — "A single example of                  a pentacrinoid in an early           stage
was found associated              with-il^/. eschriclitii.     It  resembled     closely the
larva of Ant. xarsii but the specimen                   was not sufficiently perfect for
 a critical examination."              Neither of the larva? which           I  am about        to
describe      is at      all   like that of Ant.        dentata,   and   I fear,   therefore,
that the one mentioned                  by Sir Wyville        Thomson        has somehow
been mislaid.
    No.   1.    In this larva         there   is   no trace of cirri, the anal            plate
 separates two of the radials, and                  the  arms    are  just beginning           to
sprout from the radial axillaries.                  There are five discoidal joints            at
the top of the broken stem, which is much                       more    robust than         that
of the corresponding stage of Ant. rosacea                   ; while the       head, which
exceeds     1   mm.      in    length, is nearly twice         as   big as that         of   tlie
rosacea      larva.       The orals which rest directly on the radials                   recall
those of Ilyocrinus,            having   a deep    median groove, only more           marked
than    in that type, with the lateral edges folded over somewhat
strongly.         This interesting larva may perhaps belong to Ant
phalanrjium,         but     I   rather doubt such being the             case.     For     that
species is almost the nearest ally of Ant. rosacea;                     and from what I

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84                                    365
     hare seen of the condition           of  the youngest unattached            individuals,
     I should judge       that the larva was not very different from that of
     Ant. rosacea.
        I think it much more probable,               judging      from the robust nature
    of this larva, that     it  belongs either to one of the            Arctic  species, Ant.
    eschriehti,    or Ant. quadrata, sp. n., or to Ant. hystrix, sp. n., which
    is as  yet only known          from the cold area.            It  is very  likely only     a
   younger stage of the larva next to be described.
       No. 2. The stem, which is broken some 20 mm. from the calyx,
   forms an      attachment to       a  hydroid     tube   at about its 30th        joint, and
  is continued       downwards half a dozen joints further.                   There are five
  discoidal      joints below        the   rudimentary centrodorsal,            which bears
  the sockets       of five short cirri.          Only    one of them remains,             how
  ever,    reaching up to the top of the basals, which make up about
  half the height of the cup.                The second        radials and axillaries are
  well developed,         as are also the arms,        which are unfortunately broken
  at   about the tenth       joint.       But even under these circnmstances                 the
  head has a       length of      4 mm.       A slightly bifid       plate, having a some
  what worn         appearance,       stands     up in one of the interradii of the
 disc.       It   may be one of the            orals, or    as   I  am more       inclined to
 think, the anal plate          ;   for  I cannot make out anything correspond-
 iug to     it in the    other interradii, which are, however,               but imperfectly
 visible.        A   striking     feature of this very robust larva, and one in
 which      it  resembles      Ant. dentata        rather than Ant. rosacea,             is the
large development of the arms                    before the appearance of            the   cirri
 The radials and brachials are much larger than those of a recently
detached          individual of Ant.           rosacea.      This is     also the case in a
 "Challenger" pentacrinoid from Ascension, which has a robust
appearance like the one under consideration.                              The latter must
certainly belong to one of the three Antedon species already men
tioned as occurring           in the cold       area, though further identification is
impossible.

long-jointed     cirri, which vary considerably in appearance.                  One of
the largest reaches        36 mm., and consists of forty smooth joints, of
which all but the basal and terminal ones are longer than broad,                      the
fifth to the tenth being especially            so.    The cirri attached round        the
upper edge of the centrodorsal are all of this smooth type, and                     may
be observed      in every stage of growth.               But   those attached    nearer
the dorsal pole       are somewhat different             in  appearance.    They      are
more slender,     and their component joints are relatively shorter                than
in   the other type      ; while the joints have slightly expanded distal
ends, so as to overlap their successors.                  This  is especially marked
on the dorsal side, which is produced                into a sharp forward project
ing spine.     I  have reason        to believe that these characters       gradually
disappear    as the   joints   increase     in  age,  and that the mature cirri        of
the two types      are not very different in appearance,             especially   about
what might be called            the equator        of the centrodorsal.       But    the
smooth    young cirri all round its edge are totally different from                  the
spiny ones nearer the dorsal pole.
    Traces of the first radials may be seen at the angles of the calyx                   ;
but there is no constancy          about their appearance even in individual
specimens.      The second radials are short, even at the sides, and                  are
often not visible at all in the middle line of the ray, owing to their
being very deeply incised to receive the strong backward projections
of the axillaries.         These      are quadrate      in form, with their        sides
curved, especially the anterior pair             ;  and they are distinctly longer
than wide, sometimes          almost seeming         to overlap the centrodorsal          ;
but much less than half the length is in front of the line joining
their lateral angles.         The first brachials have long outer sides              and
very short inner ones,            but (Uke the second radials) are               almost
invisible   in the middle line of the arm, owing to the very                     strong
backward projections of the irregularly triangular second brachials,
which nearly reach the axillaries.               Both on these joints and on          the
rudely oblong third brachials, which are much wider than long,                        the
pinnule-socket is placed much nearer the dorsal surface than                      usuaL
The next following           joints     are short     and quadrate,      with   curved
proximal and distal edges           ;   and the pinnule is on the shorter           side,
the longer being marked by a backward projection.
    There are syzygies        in   the    3rd and 8th brachials, and then               at
intervals of three or four joints throughout the rest of the arm.                    The

lower brachials are           triangular    and slightly       wider than long       ;   but
 they slowly become quadrate and finally slightly elongated                        towards
 the arm-ends.
     The first pair of pinnules (on 2 and 3 br.) are much longer and
 stouter than the next pair.              They reach nearly 15 mm., and consist
of some       thirty smooth joints, the first six of which                  are short and
nearly      square.       The    second     pair    have    but   eighteen     or twenty
slender     joints, and        are only     about    6   mm.    long.      The following
pinnules      increase gradually, both in length and stoutness,                   reaching
15     mm.     in the outer parts of           the    arms.     The two basal joints
become      slightly   flattened     and the succeeding ones elongated.                They
have a somewhat glassy aspect, especially                 in the later pinnules, while
their     ends present the usual dead white appearance.                         The     same
difference      presents itself in the joints of the younger and more spiny
cirri    round the dorsal          pole, and also       in the pinnules and cirri of
Ant.      dentata.      It   recalls the contrast between the hyaline                     and
porcellanous        types      of Foraminifera,        though     due    to   entirely    dif
ferent      causes.        The     ovaries   are    long    and fusiform,        extending
over the greater part of the length of the lower pinnules                             ;   and
the disc     is naked, or rather closely           covered    with irregular polygonal
plates.

     Remarks.     — The foregoing description            is based upon the characters
preseuted by three examples of                    the   type,   two    obtained     by the
"Porcupine" and               one    by the      "Triton."       They     all  agree     very
closely in        their    general     features,    and especially in the           curious
dimorphism          of    the   cirri,   which     recalls that     already noticed in
Ewliocrinus          varians*        The shape       of the axillaries        and of      the
second       brachials is very striking,           the great     length of the former
being much more marked than in Ant. eschrichti.                       It  is the characters
 of the radials and three               lowest brachials which            principally     dis

       Centrodorsal     hemispherical, roughened at the dorsal pole,                 and
 bearing about a dozen slender cirri which reach nearly 30                      mm. in
 length.       They have about fifty joints, of which the first three                  or
 four are quite short, the next three much longer, and the following
 ones longer than wide, but gradually diminishing                 up to the fifteenth
 or twentieth joint.          From this point (or earlier) to the end of the
 cirrus the joints have a well-marked dorsal spine, which is slightly
 less distinct     in those  just preceding        the terminal claw.       Ten   arm?,
 or     (rarely) two distichals       not united        by syzygy.      First   radials
 scarcely     visible except    sometimes       at the angles of the calyx.          The
 second      short and trapezoidal, with a strong median ridge, which                   is
 continued on to the axillaris.                These are just pentagonal with
 slight backward projections into the second radials, and their                    sides
 are much flattened.           This  is  still   more marked on the outer sides
 of the first brachials, which are longer than their inner sides.                   The
 second      brachials    project more      or    less backwards into        the   first,
and the third is         a syzygial joint, the next three squarish, and              the
following ones more elongated with very oblique ends.                     The  second
brachials       bear   moderately long pinnules            of about fifteen      broad
joints.       The lowest have very prominent dorsal keels which                      are

    Remarks. — Nearly          all the individuals obtained had the arms
broken at the syzygy         in the third joint beyond      the radial axillaries ;
and    it is therefore quite possible that the epizygal of this joint
might sometimes have been a distichal axillary.               In  one example, at
any rate,    there are two distichal series, each consisting of two joints,
the   second     of which     is axillary.    This   species, therefore, seems to
be   dimorphic      like Actinometra pidchella, and        to constitute   another
exception       to the general rule        that ten-armed types are sharply
distinguished from those in which the primary arms divide.                      The
length     and spiny character of its cirri, and the peculiarities of its
pinnules, readily distinguish it from all the species of Antedon hitherto
described.        But it   has many points of resemblance         to some of those
dredged      by the "Blake" in the Caribbean Sea. It is a type cf
 some    interest for two reasons : it is the only European Comatula
 which is    in the condition of        the so called recent Cystid,     Hyponome
 tarsii, i.e., with      a  plated disc and the ambulacra converted into
 tunnels    by the folding down of the           plates at their sides ; and    it is
 the only European Antedon with more than ten arms.

Caribbean            Sea.         It       was dredged by the " Blake   at a very large
number of stations                     ;    but the depth was nowhere over 300 fathoms,
and rarely exceeded                          200         fathoms;         so that          its discovery in the
"
     Porcupine" collection                     increases           both its bathymetrical and its                      geo
graphical range.                  Except                 the two species          of Rhizocrinus, it is the
only Crinoid               common to the European and Caribbean                                             seas ;   while
it    is the        only European species of Actinoraetra.                                           This   is an essen
tially tropical            genus, a few species                      only ranging to the parallels of
35°, such           as those               at the Cape             of Good Hope, Yeddo,                        and this
Gibraltar           specimen.               The depth too, 477 fathoms, is much                                  greater
than that at which the genus usually occurs                                           ;    so   that this "          Porcu

pine          specimen          which, like Rhizocrinus                      rawsoni, was obtained in
European            seas    long before                   its discovery on the other side of the
Atlantic, is of interest in                          every way.
     The "Porcupine's" discovery of Actinometra pulclwlla in the East
Atlantic        has been recently confirmed and extended by the dredgings
of the telegraph-ship                      " Dacia,"         a few dismembered individuals having
been obtained              in   lat. 34° 57'               N.,    long.   11° 57'         W.,   at a depth of 533
fathoms.
     All      the    primary arms divide except one                               ;   but the number                  20 is
kept up by the fact that                             a    palmar axillary is present on one of the
secondary arms, a point which                                 I
                                 do not remember to have met with

 backward           projection of the second                          brachials.              The "Porcupine"

 robust appearance                      than is generally presented                      by this species, and
 looks altogether as                    if its habitat        were in the cold area.

    A small but singularly interesting                example      of this well-known
Arctic    type.    The cirri are small and comparatively                     delicate, not
exceeding      20 mm.      in length     ;   and the arm-bases          are but slightly
tubercular.      All   the arms      have     been broken         either at the      second
(8th) or third syzygy (12th or 13th brachial).
    One can therefore study the appearance presented                         by the     new
arm-joints in various stages of growth.                   The lowest and          therefore
oldest of these new joints are most like                 those of the corresponding
part of the arm in the adult, i.e., triangular or very slightly                       quad
rate,   but    relatively     long    in   proportion       to    their   width.      These
characters,    however, do not disappear            as  they do in the adult,         where
the joints     gradually become shorter and shorter,                  with    a markedly
triangular outline.         But throughout          the remainder of the restored
arms the joints are quadrate and relatively long                ;  while the two     lowest
 pinnule-joints    show but few traces of the flattening and peculiarities
 of outline which are so characteristic of the adult.                  It is just in the-*'
characters (besides the smaller size of the third pair of pinnules) that
 Antedon quadrata          (No. 7) differs from Ant, esckrichti ; and it is
 therefore    to be regarded as a permanently immature form of the
 latter species.

                                                      have little doubt that it was also
obtained       by the      "Vega."              The "  Willem Barents" met with it in
1880 near the locality of the Tegetthof                                      dredging.                  Fielden's             speci
mens were well and               carefully described                         by Sladen,* who identified
them with        that dredged            by the               " Tegetthof,"                   so       far    as        he could
judge from von Maronzeller's description of the latter.                                                            Thanks           to
the kindness of          Dr    von Marenzeller,                    I   have been enabled                           to examine
his    type    for myself, aud            I     am satisfied                  that Sladen was right in
identifying      it with        those     dredged              by the "Alert."                               After        writing
his description of them Sladen saw for the first time some                                                              examples
of Ant. celtica, Barrett sp., and recognising that these were totally
different from the Arctic specimens, he inserted                                              a note to that effect,
but did not rename the latter.
      Barrett's type now turns out to                              be the                 long but little known
Antedon phalangium of the Mediterranean                                               ;    and     the specific desig
nation ctiltira being therefore                     unoccupied,                   I       thought at first that                     it
might conveniently be retained for the type described under                                                                     this

has seemed undesirable for many reasons                                       ;       and        in compliance with
the wishes      of both         the above named                        naturalists,                I    propose              to give
it   a new name altogether.                   I    have, therefore,                        chosen one indicative

  surface arched and            the ventral one hollowed, with a small muscular
  prominence         in the centre.         It   is unprovided          with    cirri, and    not
  transparent         at   the     margin.     Mouth      ventral       and    cloacal    papilla
  dorsal    as   in M. glabrum.              Colour     dirty    yellow.        Parapodia ex
  tremely     short and reduced             to annular folds, from the                middle of
  which there          project the brownish-black              points of well- developed
 booklets.        These      are closely grouped         around the central            muscular
 prominence        ;   while the        round   suckers lie near           the    edge    of the
 ventral surface.
      A fully grown individual,                4   mm.     in diameter,        was    so firmly
 attached      to the disc of its host near the mouth that the hooklets
 remained       in  the perisome when          it  was removed.           On its back was       a
 young one        measuring         1   mm. in its longer diameter.                This differs
 from the adult            in the presence of distinct papillaj on the dorsal
 surface, separated          from one another        by considerable         intervals.

     This species         has a very singular form.               It   is transversely oval,
3-2 mm. wide and 2-7 mm. long;                      and it is thicker than any other
free-living species.             The dorsal     surface is flat, while the ventral one
is raised     like    a  cushion, with the parapodia projecting round its edge
at equal distances           apart, as wide and blunt processes, at the points of
which powerful hooklets are protruded for some distance.                                   There
are no suckers ;             while     the  mouth and         cloacal     openings,      usually
situated on the same side                as the parapodia,       are placed on the dorsal
surface.        Both this and the ventral surface are of                     a   strong yellow
brown colour.             The only specimen obtained was closely attached                      to
the perisome          of its host.        Xo other Myzostomida but M. pidvinar

    I  .have dedicated       this species to my friend             Dr P. H. Carpenter.
 It  is of a dirty yellow colour,        2'3   mm. long, and of slightly greater
 width.     Twenty short cirri appear at its margin,                     which is without
 a  transparent rim.          In  fact, the    whole disc          is tirm     and opaque.
 The form of the ventral surface is most unusual,                         and   there is no
 trace   of the muscular prominence which is so generally present                           in
 its centre.    This would indicate that             the parapodial musculature              is
 very weak.       The parapodia        themselves        are   extremely       slendur   an-i
 short, being lodged in shallow pits close to the edge of the ventral
 aide, and almost on the same level with                  the equally feeble        suckera.
 Both mouth and cloacal             opening are terminal.                 Attachud    to the
 dorsal surface of one of the two adults was an immature                          individual

 hollowed          out into        a   funnel-shaped pitcher, with                      two   largely     de
 veloped wing-like                expansions,       and    with    a    remarkably ciliated lid,
 whose base extends round                   fully   one half of the orifice of the pitcher,
very much as             in Sarracenia, and very unlike                       the condition in the
adult Nepenthes, where the annulus occupies                                  almost       the whole        of
the pitcher-orifice, the base of the                       lid being narrowed into                  a   very
small space.             Our seedlings also exhibit, what Hooker has described,
the convergence              of   the lateral wings towards each other above, and
their union           in the middle line, forming                  a   transverse        ciliated mem
brane below the orifice of the pitcher.
  As regards further                     details, our      seedlings         differ somewhat            from
those described              by Hooker.         In     the first place,            Hooker describes
(Belfast address) the inner surface of the pitcher                                  as    wholly gland
ular, while in our plants its upper half, or so,                                   is   eglandular and
conducting,           being thickly studded with the characteristic down
wardly directed              cresccntic     ledges.        This    difference       between the two

  382                   Proceedings     of the Royal Society
 seedlings    may     be easily   accounted      for, inasmuch as there              are some
 species of Nepenthes        in which the entire inner surface of the pitcher
 is glandular (e.g.,     N. amptdlaria and N. Hookeri),                   and his seedlings
 may have      belonged     to some such       species.         The occurrence,        indeed,
 of such a large conducting surface in the pitchers of our hybrid, is
 somewhat      surprising when its origin is considered.                     In   the female
 parent,   N. rafflesiana, the conducting surface is limited                    to an incon
 siderable area below the hinge of the lid                    ; which area, when         traced
round the upper part of the pitcher, is seen to be reduced to                            a very
 narrow stripe, just below the Hue of inflexion of theannulus                          ;  while
 in the male parent,          N. Chelsoi/i,   there is practically           no conducting
surface     at all, there     being nothing left of it but the merest                     trace,
 running     along below the said line of inflexion.                      The only     sugges
tion   I can   make on the subject is that there may here be a reversion
to some ancestor of the cross-bred            N. Ckehoni.              The following       table
represents     the rather complicated genealogy                   of our seedlings,      so far

It will     be observed       that the     male      parent      of N. Dominii         has not
been    recorded.       On examining this form (which closely resembles
N. rajjlesiana       in the limitation of its conducting surface), I have
been struck with the great breadth and almost horizontal expansion
of the reflexed        portion of the annulus             ;   and   I  would suggest        that
perhaps      N. Veitchii, which        seems      (I   only know of this             plant    by
figure)   to exhibit     this character to      a  still      more     marked degree,       may
have been the parent in question.
    In  the second place, Hooker describes                  the first developed pitchers
of his seedlings        as destitute of annulus (Linn. Soc. Tram., xxii. P-
4  IS, footnote)    ;  while in ours this structure is very readily recog
nised, even     in the leaf immediately succeeding                      the cotyledons,      by
its epidermis of iuibricately         disposed        glassy cells, and        its  inflexion
within     the pitcher-orifice.      As    to this,     I    should almost be         inclined

                                                                                             38;;
                        of Edinburgh,        Session         1883-84.
 to believe    that the supposed absence of annulus was the result of an
 oversight,    so    distinctly     developed      is   it in my         specimens   ;   not to
speak of its      universal occurrence in the adult Nepenthes plant.
      Regarding      the anatomical      structure of these pitchers, there are
several interesting       points to note.
      A. The Pitcher-lid.         — This exhibits ciliary           processes each tipped
with a cell-group         resembling     that of a glandular hair.               These pro
cesses,   however, seem to be somewhat                  more than mere epidermal ap
pendages,      at least containing ground-tissue,                   as   evidenced       by the
occurrence      of the curious spiral cells which are developed so exten
sively in the ground tissue            of these plants         ;   and possibly they may
represent     prolongations of the entire leaf substance, like the tentacles
of Drosera.          Furthermore,        there is no          trace of the honey-glands
which are to be seen on the            lid of    the adult form in both its parents                 ;
and in    connection with this, it is interesting to note the absence of
lid-glands in the adult of           N. ampullaria, which                species may thus be
considered as exhibiting the undifferentiated or embryonic character.
    B. The Annulus.         — This      is quite distinctly marked,             and may        be
traced    by its characteristically imbricate epidermis from just above
the transverse        membrane       joining     the wings up to the pitcher-orifice,
where     it is inflected    as a    slightly crenated margin.               The most inter
esting feature of the annulus,             however,          is the presence, just within
the   inflexed margin, of small cushion- or button-like glands, resem
bling in general character the glands of the secreting surface in the
lower part     of    the pitcher-cavity.          In    the first leaf and those imme
diately succeeding          it,   these glands are usually three              in number (in
one specimen        I   have seen only two).            In   the subsequently developed
leaves    they become more numerous, and in our seedlings now about
a   year old, as many as twenty of these glands may be counted                             along
the margin of         a            an inch long.
                          pitcher about            They form     very                    a
pretty circlet — or rather semi-circlet — reminding one of the row of
ocelli    in an Actinia.          The presence of these glands in the annulus,
coupled       with   the absence of lid-glands, at once arrested my atten
tion, and led me to suppose that here we probably had structures of
greater morphological             significance    and of more universal occurrence
than the glands of the lid, since                 these glands — physiologically              im
portant as      they undoubtedly are — are not                  necessarily    present in the
adult plant.        I   have accordingly examined the annulus of                     a   number

.'J   84                      Proceedings          of   the     Royal Society
of adult forms, and in this                  I     have         to acknowledge much valuable
co-operation            from my assistant,     Dr J. M. Macfarlane. The result
has almost surpassed                 my expectations. In all the species examined
there       is    to be seen, immediately                  above        the      edge of        the indexed
margin,       a    single line of small orifices alternating with the ridges                                       of
the corrugated            annulus, and with their tooth-like prolongations when
these are present.                  These orifices             are    the    openings of canal-like
fossa?,      from the bottom of each of which                          a    cellular nipple-like             pro
cess or      mammilla projects.               These mammilla?                   are the apices of what
may bo            termed      the    Marginal Glands.                      The      glands       are   of very
large size        ;   the    smallest   I     have        seen — those           of    Ar.     ampnllaria—
being              of an inch in length, while                        in    some other forms            — e.g.,
N. destillatoria,              N. phyllamphora,                      and an         undetermined            form
(apparently allied             to the   hybrid N. Dominii), for which our Garden
was indebted to the late                    Miss Hope of Wardie, they may reach                               the
enormous          length of        ^   of an inch.              The nipple-like              apex just men
tioned       is   never more than about                   7Jn of       an inch in length, and                      is
the        only portion        of    the.    gland which              is    free,     all the rest       beini:
immersed           in the parenchymatous substance                            of the annulus.                The
cells      composing these glands are of somewhat small size, and                                             are
very numerous.                Those in the immersed                        portion are, in         a   general
way, disposed in lines which pass obliquely inwards and towards                                              the
apex, the peripheral cells having                     a    more or less transverse                  direction,
while the central ones are longitudinally                              disposed.             The   superficial
cells      of the mammilla exhibit                    a   beautiful columnar                   arrangement,
being        elongated        at    right angles          to    the    surface.           In    some     case:,
especially         in the larger forms, there                   seems to be           a   tendency     to the
formation of             a   central cavity from disruption                         from each other            of
                                                        in the axis              but                           b1
the longitudinally             disposed       cells                         ;         I      should    not
inclined to attach any physiological significance to this                                      circumstance.
In     shape       the    marginal glands vary somewhat.                              In N.      ampullar"'
the shape          is    ampullate, the nipple-like apex representing the                                neck,
while the immersed                   portion, somewhat                 pointed at the              base, aw
broadening upwards, represents                        the       body of the ampulla.                   In    thi
more        elongated        forms the        shape         is   more        or less         cylindrical      o:
sausage-like.
      The marginal glands,             it   will   be seen, are remarkable not only                          loi
their large size, but still more for their immersed condition— tin

                             of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                 385
other glands of Nepenthes                  (lid-glands     as  well as peptic onus) pro
jecting     entirely free from the surface, eovered                   in though they       may
 lie by a    pocket-like flap, or sunk at the bottom of                    a surface   depres
sion.     In their      immersed       character,     the marginal glands are perfectly
comparable to the immersed                    glands of the secreting         surface of the
piteher of Cephulotus.                As  to the function of these marginal glands,
I   cannot as yet speak              definitely.      Sir Joseph Hooker         says (Iielfast
Address)        that       the    pitcher-margins        of   Nepenthes      always secrete
honey;      but from his making no allusion to these very remarkable
glands,     I  am doubtful whether he refers to them or not.                       Probably,
however, they are honey-secreting, and all'ord                      to the    insect the last
drops,    just   as    it   is on the   brink of destruction.
     C.   The Condmtiivj surface.              — This    agrees essentially with that in
the     adult forms.            I  have   here     to note    that each crescentiu        ledge
 consists of        a single        semilunar cell,      which     overlaps a lower         and
 smaller      cell.      Occasionally these            two   cells  somewhat puzzlingly
 resemble deformed                stomata,     but   I  have   not   as   yet been able to
 trace a   more definite relation in this direction.
     D.   The Secreting           or Digestive surface.      — The epidermis        cells here
 are    remarkable           for their wavy outlines, differing             from the       more
 angular form exhibited                in    the adult plants of the           parent    forms.
  The     glands,       moreover,       are     in   the   tirst-formed     leaves    entirely
  exposed, although             in the later ones the rudiment of the protective
  pocket-like       flap may be seen.              In this connection Dr Macfarlanu
  has   pointed out to me that in N. phyllampliora                       the   peptic   glands
  are   only to a very slight extent covered                    by flaps, so that in this
  plant we have           the persistence        of an embryonic character.             In   tin:
  first pitchers      of the seedling         the peptic glands are few         in number —
   about   ten;      hut      in   the  later developed          ones   they become        very
   numerous.

      In   the progression of fractions here used, each new term is got by
 corresponding            multiples of the three preceding                                     terms, thus:
                                 rB + gC + pD = E,

 this mode of formation being applied                                             separately         to the numerators

    The asymptote             of every progression            of this kind is shown to           be
the root of a cubic equation                  ;  while, for every cubic equation with
integer coefficients,             such     progressions       may      be     found.     Thus  the
corresponding theorem in quadratics,                      which was thought to exclude
periodicity from all higher equations,                      becomes only one case of a
general law.

             2.  The Researches of M. E. de Jonquieres on Periodic
                  Continued Fractions.          By Thomas Muir, M.A.
           1.  During the     present year there has appeared at intervals,        in the
       Comptet Rendus of          the   French Academy, quite a series of com
      munications      by M. E.     de Jonquieres, on the subject of those periodic
      continued      fractions which are the equivalents of the square roots
      of integers.      These communications have attracted attention, both
      on account of the number of results given in them, and because, as
      a  writer in the Bulletin, des Sciences Maihimatique*                says, of their
     interesting and profound             character.   To any    one really intimate
      with the bibliography of the subject, this cannot but be a little sur
     prising.       It  is true that the number of so-called        theorems is great ;
     but the very special          character   of a number of them, the fact that
     they are     just such theorems       as may be    obtained by experiment and
    induction,       and the want of demonstrations of them            as evidence   that
    the author was in possession of a mathematical theory of the subject,
    are    points that     have been too much overlooked           Further, and what
    is more important, many of the theorems are not new, and there is
                                                  "
   a sense in which the epithet " new                cannot fairly be applied to any
   of the earlier           ones, because of the     existence  of a widely general
   theorem         in which they       are directly included, or from        which they
   may      with    readiness    be deduced.
        2.    It is to this    general   theorem   I  now wish to direct attention,
  making use of it for the purpose indicated, viz., of giving scientific
  order and unity to M. de Jonquieres' work. The theorem was given
  in the year 1873, in the first paper I had the honour of communi
  cating to this Society, and is to be found at p. 234 of vol. viii. of the
  Proceedings.             It, as well as several other theorems given in the
 paper, was originally accompanied by a good deal of detail of the
 same nature as M. de Jonquieres' theorems; these special proposi
 tions, however, were struck out, when by request an abstract of the
paper was prepared for printing. A special case of the theorem has
been rediscovered twice at least since 1873 ; the latest appearance
being in. Grunert's Archiv, lxix. pp. 205-13, where the writer,
        22. Hoffmann, says regarding it :

ratio 2a          :   d remains constant, because of a varying as d, is no altera

from actual observation, knows                                          as     well      as      any one that              if   merely

in extent, and that                                the     case          where           it    does       not       vary        (M.     de

Then, again,                   M.     de Jonquieres                      forces         into his service              facts which
are manifestly                      against           him.           He says theorems                         I.,   II., III.         bear

                                 Hoggan, M.B. (Edin.).                                                       Com
         municated by Professor Turner.
                                                             (Abstract.)
     The new forms have been                                   found in the palms of the                   raccoon,
the Proeyon lotor,                 so named                  from its habit of dipping its morsels                 in
water before eating them.                                These forms are three in number,                        and,
in order        to prevent any morphological                                or physiological         appellation
being applied to them,                              they havo          been      named,      for purposes          of
description           and     differentiation, after three                         ladies respectively,           the
Browne,          the    Hoggan, and the                             Blackwell      bodies.          The    Browne
bodies occupy the apices of the dermic papilla, exactly where                                                     the

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                             401
    Meissner    bodies     are   found      in  man,   monkeys,      and marsupials     ;
   otherwise    they     have     no resemblance       to  these   bodies.    Properly
   speaking, they are not bodies, but only forked terminations of the
   nerves,   formed generally of two or three                prongs,   and these are
   twisted   and intertwined           in  an intricate    manner.     Nor    do   they
   possess any capsular envelopes, the presence of which differentiates
   them  from the Hoggan bodies, that being the only distinct differ
   ence between      the two.
      The Hoggan bodies in their external aspect resemble the Pacinian
  bodies, being provided           with    a greater   or less number of capsular
  layers, according to the greater             or less depth at which they lie in
 the dermis.        The nerve terminations within the body are, however,
 quite distinct from anything yet found in the Mammalia, being in
 general branched immediately after the nerve has become enveloped
 in the capsules.         In their branched and contorted form              the nerve
 terminations resemble            the    Browne bodies      plus the capsules      they
 have received.         It   is probable     that the Browne bodies        are formed
 by rupture of some of the non-medullated nerve fibres forming the
 subepidermic plexus,           a  little beyond the point where a medullated
 nerve has joined the plexus.                These ruptured     fibres  contract upon
 themselves,      and thus         form the Browne         body.      As  the Browne
 body sinks       more      deeply into the dermis it seems to receive the
cellular envelopes        which characterise        the Hoggan body.
     The Blackwell        body is a modified subepidermic nerve ganglion,
still attached to the epidermis,              but of which all the cells get com
pressed     into   a more      or less globular or oval form, and are all in
connection        with a very thick            medullated     nerve.    It  is indeed
a   modified Meissner body within the epidermis in its most complete
form, but a subepidermic ganglion in its simplest forms.                       It   is a
midway       link  between      these two organs.
     The Browne and Hoggan bodies seem to be homologous with the
forked nerve endings on the hair follicles, and so far they support
the author's       previously published views that the Pacinian                  bodies
are only modifications of the forked endings.
     In most of the           sections    the   sweat   glands seem to be greatly
deficient in number, and as the author has in other animals, especially
rodents, observed          Meissner bodies to be only developed              where the
sweat glands were           enormous       in  size and number, he argues          from

402                      Proceedings   of the Royal Society
this — first, that moisture is necessary               to  give proper sensation         ;
second,     that      the deficiency    of sweat        makes  the animal dip its
morsels     in water      ;  and  third, that this continual wetting of               the
hands has modified the nerve terminations.

                       By Professor W. A. Herdman.
     This paper     deals    only with the Ascfdioe           Simplicee        collected
  during the cruises      of the "Porcupine"        in the summers            of 186S-
  1870.    The Asciidce Composites will he worked up along with the
  "              "
    Challenger      forms, and will appear in the second part of the
  Report upon the Tunicata of that expedition.
     Eleven species of simple         Ascidians    were     found     in the      " Por
 cupine" collection.       There are no Clavelinidai,          hut the other three
 families   are   represented   — the Ascidiidse by           three      species,     the
  CynthiidaB by five species, and the Molgulidae by three species.
     Three species (all belonging to the genus Polycarpa) seem new to
 science ; the remaining eight are most of them common British
 species.    Some     of them, however, possess          an interest apart from
 their   morphological      peculiarities on account of the             localities and
 depths from which they were obtained.                  For   example,      several    of
 the stations are in localities of which the Aseidian              fauna had never
 been investigated, and the        depths of which exceed              100     fathoms.
 Styrla grossularia, van Beneden,           a common       British    species,    which
 is usually regarded     as a littoral or shallow-water form, was obtained
 in the North Atlantic between          Lewis and the Faroe Islands (Station
 54), at a depth of 363 fathoms          !
 6.   Arrangement of the Metals in an Eleetro-Frietional Scale.
                           By A. Maefarlane, D.Sc.
    While, in    recent years, the progress       of the science of electricity
has been    very rapid, few investigations         have been       made    in the    old
province of frictional electricity.          It cannot be doubted, however,
that the    laws connecting electricity          with friction,      and    with     the
nature of the substances         rubbed, are of great importance            ;   and the
acquisition    of more detailed knowledge in              this   department         may
throw some light on the          still imperfect theory of        the    voltaic cell.
.Several electricians have expressed         an opinion that the development
of electricity by friction is only a modification of the developmei.t
of electricity     by   contact — that friction      is   contact in which           the

number of points        which come together is increased by sliding the
one substance       over the other.      But whether friction is         a  form of
contact, or contact      a form of friction, or the two co-ordinate to one
another,    it is interesting     to  inquire   whether     the   metals can be
arranged    in  an electro-frictional   series similar   to the electro-contact
series ;  and if so, to observe the relation of the former to the latter.
   What is      the   present state of our knowledge on thus subject                  1
Experimenters have used ono or other of two methods,                    either rub
bing the metal      with   an insulating    substance,   or brushing it with         a
metallic powder.          Observations cannot be made, or at least have
not as yet been made with          success, by rubbing      two metals directly
against one another,       as their high conductivity     allows the generated
electricities to combine too quickly.          Information      on this subject is
contained in the treatises of Reiss and Mascart.
    Haiiy,* rubbing with        a woollen cloth, found        that the following
metals became        positively electrified —
                  Silver, lead, copper, zinc, brass, bismuth       ;
while the following became negatively electrified —
    Platinum, palladium, gold, nickel, iron, tin,         arsenic,   antimony.
    Faraday,   f  on the contrary, using the same material for a rubber,
found that silver and copper became negatively electrified.                    When
these two are taken out of the former list, the           four left — lead, zinc,
brass, bismuth      — are metals which     are easily disintegrated      ;  and that
we shall find is the reason why they become             electrified in the oppo
site manner from the others.
   Uessaignes,J      also  rubbing with     a woollen stuff, gives         a  wholly
indefinite result, — that gold, platinum, silver,        copper,   iron, bismuth,
zinc, tin, antimony, lead, are sometimes            positive, sometimes         nega
tive, and sometimes        neutral.    He considered that the season of the
year, the prevailing        wind, the barometer,     and the thermometer,          all
had an influence on the result.            Fortunately,    the subject is not so
complex as this experimenter would have us believe;                  I  have found
that,     provided    the   insulation   and the    state    of the surfaces       be
attended to,       the season of the year,       the barometer,       the    thermo
 meter, and the prevailing wind          may be left out of account.            It  is

 possible,    however, that the state of the air             as regards    moisture may
have some influence.            If   the surface      of the metal is moist, or the
rubber moist, the amount of electricity produced by a rub is not so
great as when both are dry.               This   difference    is due, in part at least,
and   it may      be entirely, to the worse          insulating power of the moist
or moistened rubber.
   Cavallo,* with sealing-wax             as the   rubbing material, found all the
metals     he tried      negative   ;  but Singerf found iron, steel, graphite,
lead, and bismuth           positive,    the others negative.           The iron, how
ever,   was      positive only when rubbed with smooth wax                        ; it   was
negative when rubbed with tarnished (soft T) wax.                        WilsonJ found
with a silver plate, that when he rubbed the wax on the surface the
plate    became      positive, but when he rubbed it on the edge the plate
became       negative.      Some    experiments which            I   have   made     throw
light  on these anomalies.
   With sulphur          as  the   rubbing       material, Davyg found that lead
having     a  fresh surface became negative, but when it had                  a  tarnished
surface became positive.            While Wileke found all             the metals nega
tive excepting lead, Faraday found iron, copper, brass,                        tin, silver,
and platinum         positive.     The     contradictory       results in the case of
sulphur appear to be due to the presence                   or absence of abrasion in
the   rubbing,      and to the presence           or absence      of  a  charge     on the
sulphur.

   lead or   bismuth to become positive.           Hard rubbing         was doubtless
   the cause    of his anomalies also.
      The method        by metallic powder was employed             by Singer*       and
   Becquerel.      The former experimenter allowed the powder to fall
   through     a sieve   of haircloth,    flannel, or muslin.          He found       the
   powder always negative,        whether it was of copper,           iron, zinc, tin,
   bismuth,     antimony, nickel,      or graphite.       Here    the    friction    was
  gentle,   and   in  consequence    no anomaly.       Becquerelf       experimented
  with filings     of copper and of zinc.        He allowed       the tilings to      fall
  on a    slant plate (in connection with the earth), and to drop into a
  metallic receiver attached to the knob of an electroscope.                   He found
  that the copper filings were positive, when the plate was of
               Copper, zinc, lead, tin, iron, bismuth, antimony              ;
  and  without any sensible charge when the plate was of
                               Platinum, gold, silver.
  With zinc filings, the following were negative           —
                    Platinum, gold, silver, copper, graphite          ;
 and the    following positive —
                          Zinc, iron, bismuth, antimony.
 These results, so far as they go, agree very well               with    those   I have
 obtained, and that agreement           proves that the metals may be com
 pared by rubbing them          all with  one suitable substance.
    None of the investigators mentioned place the metals in a scale                      ;
 Becquorel's      results place    them     in three    groups.      The only scale
 which    I   have found published is a qualitative one by Gaugain.
He experimented with discs of about                 7   cm. diameter,       formed of
gutta percha,        and gutta percha       rubbed for a greater         or less time
with sulphur.          He rubbed such an insulating disc with wires of the
different metals ; and the place of the metal was determined by the
kind of electricity produced and retained on the disc.                   The scale or
rather classification is as follows       : —

   This   arrangement          of the metals differs from that which results
from my experiments chiefly in the position of tin, bismuth, and
antimony.      The positions                 of the latter two are contradictory                        to
Becquerel's results.
   In   the experiments which                  I   have made        I   have       aimed at getting
quantitative results.               With      an electroscope       to scrutinise the electri
city produced,       only qualitative results could                          be    looked for      ;   but
with    an electrometer         to scrutinise tho electricity, more definite                           in
formation is possible.               I had tho      advantage of the use of a Thomson
quadrant electrometer,              and not only so, but of all the scientific con
veniences    of Professor Tait's laboratory.
   The metal to be rubbed was constructed in the form of                                     a   circular
disc (fig.   1),   with   a   projecting tongue for allowing                      it   to be screwed
on to the brass top           (s)   of   a   glass insulator (g) (fig. 2).             The diameter
of the disc was in each case 2-5 inch (6-3 cm.), and the thickness
two-tenths of an inch      mm.).   Some of the discs varied slightly
                                     (5
from that thickness;            but       a    small difference         in thickness does not
affect the capacity of the disc, for the capacity                       of   a    disc depends only
on the diameter (Clerk-Maxwell,                       El. and Mag., voL           i     p.   222).      A

                                 of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.   4L7
   small        pin     (Ji) in the
   brass top passed through
   the smaller hole (h) in
   the tongue of the plate,
   so that       when the disc
   and top        were          screwed
  together           by     a     screw
  passing through («), the
  disc was prevented from
  rotating when brushed.
  The end of the wire
                       (ic)
  (fig. 3), connecting the
 disc with the electrode
 of the electrometer,                  was
 screwed in between                    the
 head      of the screw and
 the disc.
       Toobtain quantitative
 results,       it is
              necessary
to be able to give the
 disc a constant rub.                    I
 found          that       a     small
camel's-hair           brush forms
a very         convenient rub
ber.           The      hair      is    a
sufficiently           good       insu
lator, not very difficult
to discbarge         after a whisk
across the metal, and                   it
does      not        scratch       the
metal — a most import
ant      consideration.                 I
always         gave the disc            a
single whisk — never a
plurality — for one read
ing.      I drew          the brush
across the middle zone
 (a)   (fig.    3), exerting           as

418                      Proceedings      of the  Royal Society
far    as   possible the same pressure          each time, and moving              with  the
same       velocity.      Variation    in velocity produces           very considerable
variation in the amount of electricity produced,                    or at least left after
the operation.           It is also necessary that the brush be spread out
to an equal        extent in the successive whisks.               I found that by first
 placing the brush in            position at the side at a constant angle to
 the disc,     and then moving it across with due regard                        to  pressure
 and velocity, that a set of successive             readings      has very considerable
 constancy.         For   example, the following for copper, taken at random

  The differences        are fairly   alternate    in sign, and the mean of the
  readings    may with reason bo assumed as giving the effect of the                     rub
  aimed at      in   the ten trials.      However,       I   found later on that the
  readings    tend to increase as the succession             of whisks goes on.
     It   may be asked, Does the brush change                   in power after making
  a   considerable number           of whisks?        De la Rive          in his memoir
  cautions us when rubbing with              a  stick of wood to          use a new     stick
  eat:h   time, or else to serape the surface              used with       a   bit of glass.
  Were it necessary to         use  a new brush each time, then to make                   the
  thousand and          half observations which          I    have    made would        b<?  a
  matter of expense.          "When the brush is heated slightly before the fire,
  it produces     a larger deflection than when       it  is not heated.      For example,
 after     I had finished the series of readings              for copper, given above,
 and     similar series for zinc,        tin, iron, and lead,          I held the brush

   for a minute        before    a strong fire, and then took three                   readings.
   The deflections      were —
                                      195, 215, 220,
   giving an     average       of 210, which        is nearly double the previous
  average.     Hair is known to             be  highly hygroscopic           ;   the heating
  drives off the moisture,         and the brush, when brought to the electro
  meter, is    found to be electrified positively.                 Flannel,      after being
  warmed      before    the fire, is also electrified positively.                These     facts
  seem    to favour the idea that electricity is produced by evaporation.
  It  is not advisable to have the brush very dry, for                    it   is then more
  troublesome to take away the charge from                  it  before using       it  a second
 time.
     In  the record of results appended             (Table I.) I have entered all the
 average     readings obtained.          Each entry is the average generally of
 ten    deflections,     sometimes      of fifteen and of five.           The number of
 single observations made is upwards of one thousand.                            The course
 of the experiments breaks up into four series.
     In    the  case of the first series          I    experimented with             a disc    of
 copper and a           disc    of zinc, each of which had one side highly
 polished.       The two       averages for zinc obtained on the 26th Novem
 ber are nearly equal to one another,                 and to the average of all the
 average     readings.        It  is necessary to choose a standard number for
one of the metals,          and to compare       the others      with it   ; hence copper
is always taken            as   100.    The electrometer         was duly replenished
each    morning, and all the conditions were preserved                    constant        as  far
as   possible ; but various circumstances               caused the magnitude             of the
deflections     to vary considerably from day to day.                  The first entry of
26th November was got by observing the first swing of the electro
meter,      the second        by observing the permanent              deflection.         In all
the subsequent observations               it was the permanent          deflection        which
was noted.         One side of the copper disc was not so highly polished
as the     other; the rougher          side   gave an average of 123              ;  the more
polished taken subsequently gave an average of 126.                            I do not con
sider this comparison             as conclusive   ;   for  I   afterwards found that            a
disc    of copper      gave a decidedly larger deflection            than a disc of brass
copper-plated        ;  and     one  of the differences         between     the two discs
was, that the latter had a much smoother                       surface.     Another expe-

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                          421
    riment was made         with the copper disc with the view of ascertaining
    whether an increase       of temperature        had an effect upon the amount
 of electricity produced         by the whisk.          The disc was heated to such
 a   temperature that        it could not    be held     in the hand with any                 degree
 of comfort ; the deflections           were   —
     100, 100, 120, 85, 170, 170,            105, 115, 155, 165, 180, 145, 120,
                                            180, 200,
giving    an   average        of 140,       compared      with        126    before      heating.
 When a brass disc             was heated      in   a   similar manner,            the average
deflection was increased           in much the same proportion.                          It   is not
improbable that         the effect is due to the heat of the disc                       increasing
the    insulation of the brush          (see p. 428).
      On the 29th November the surfaces                   of the discs were polished
with a fine sand paper.            The several observations             were —
Copper, 215, 220, 210, 150, 167, 165, 140, 165, 165, 215, 145, 180,
                   215, 185, 140.
 Zinc, 35, 70, 80, 70, 90, 40, 110, 75, 45, 110, 70, 85, 90, 65, 75,
                   110.
The average for the copper is 178               ;   for the zinc 45,         if   the first read
ing is not taken into account               and the last        is,   and 42      if   the first    is
and the last      is   not.     The smallness of the first deflection                    is    to be
attributed,   I   believe, to     a    few of the minute particles of zinc or of
sand produced in the cleaning process                   still remaining        on the surface
of the metal.          Many of the subsequent experiments were made with
the    view of clearing up this effect, and the still greater effect gene
rally produced when zinc              is   polished with emery paper.
     The second series of observations                  were   made         with   coins      and   a
platinum capsule, while discs of other metals were being prepared.
A    half-sovereign (11/12 fine gold), sixpence (37/40 fine silver), and
                                                a
a   cent (88 Cu to    Ni), are of nearly equal diameter, and therefore of
                        12
nearly equal capacity.            If   the cent be taken as 100, the sovereign
is   123, and the sixpence         71.       The second comparison                was obtained
by taking a florin and            a    penny (95        Cu to    4     Sn and       1
                                                                                         Zn)   ;   the
result obtained by supposing the bronze equivalent to copper given
a    result for silver (109), which agrees well with the best strict com
parison (107).          The result of 4th December,               gold to silver         as 193 to

422                    Proceedings    of the  Eoyal Society
 100,    was    obtained by comparing a sovereign and a shilling                       ;  it
agrees well with the ratio obtained afterwards.                   The   surfaces   of  the
coins were cleaned         with bath-brick and wiped               against   flannel; in
no    case were    the readings    anomalous     at the beginning.              The  com
 parison obtained for platinum          is only an approximation.                  It was
 obtained by comparing         a small platinum capsule, kindly lent me by
 Mr H. E. Mill, with        a florin and a penny.            The true value is pro
 bably nearer to that for gold.
     In  the third series of observations     I   made many comparisons with
 discs of copper, zinc, lead, iron, tin, and brass.                The reason why so
 many comparisons         were made     was to clear         up an anomaly which
 appeared      when the surfaces were polished with emery                    paper.      In
 the   case  of the observations    of 6th December,           one side of each disc
 was rubbed with        emery paper, and     then wiped with a dry flannel
 cloth.     The copper      disc was first tried    ;   it   gave readings none           of
 which differed greatly from the average, namely, 147.                     But   the zinc
 disc when taken gave on the first whisk +            1  10,* on the second + 45            ;
 after a few whisks the deflection vanished, then became negative,
 and gave a series of ten readings agreeing closely with their average,
 95.     The iron disc also gave      a positive deflection at first + 80             ;   it
 likewise     changed    after a slight    brushing, and gave ten readings
 agreeing pretty well with their average, 71.                 When     a fresh part       of
 either of these discs was rubbed, the deflection became positive.                       In
 the    case   of the lead disc the deflection was considerably smaller
 than the average at the beginning.            In    the ci    -<e of  the copper and
 the   tin  discs there was no such marked irregularity             ; but the average
of a serios for copper taken at the end, 187, was greater than the
average of the series taken at the           beginning of the observations,
 147.      The values entered in the upper line for the 6th are obtained
by giving copper its initial average, and those in the lower line                       by
giving it the final average.
    Next morning, 7th December,          no emery paper was used              ;  the sur
faces were merely rubbed with a piece             of white flannel which             ha»l
befln well dried.       The copper    disc  gave regular negative            deflection*
as before, but the zinc disc gave a positive deflection                at first     After
a few brushings across tho middle zone              of     the disc, the deflection
became negative,       and remained      about an average.             The first road-

   ing for tin  was smaller     than any of ten subsequent,           and such was
   the case also  with the brass     ;   they were noted, but not included in
   the average.     Two series were taken for lead, the former for the
   side which had been roughened by polishing, the latter for the side
   which had not been interfered with              : in both cases the first whisk
  gave a   nearly null deflection,        but the deflection afterwards became
  pretty steady about an average.
      To further elucidate       the cause of this initial phenomenon,               I
  rubbed each disc several times with a piece of flannel stretched                over
                           ....

  but was allowed to accumulate            :—

      The lead disc was tried again, using the same side, and rubbing
 with what was noted to be a specially clean part of the flannel.
 It   became     negative    at first, then positive after several          rubs with
 considerable pressure.         The same operation was repeated, and with
 the same result.        The more polished side was then               tried ; it was
 negative at first, and greater pressure in rubbing was required to
 produce positive.         Hence, the anomalous            electricity produced on
 the lead is undoubtedly due to the fact that the rubbing                     with the
 flannel cloth abraded the lead (or the oxide of lead), as was indeed
evident from an inspection of the cloth after the operation.                      And
these    trials also show why lead and bismuth and graphite were                    so
prone to become positive under the friction to which they were sub
jected by De la Rive and the other experimenters.                     The    ease with
which these substances make a mark on paper shows that they can
be easily abraded ; and when the rubbing is so violent as to cause
abrasion, anomaly may very well be expected.
     The camel's-hair brush          changes       the electricity not from nega
tive to positive, but from positive to                negative.    It  certainly does
 not abrade the surface.          Does the explanation          of the anomaly con

sist in this, that the brush sweeps away abraded particles which have
been left by rubbing     with  emery paper     and flannel cloth, or with
flannel cloth alone, that so long as any of these particles are        in  its
course the deflection is more or less altered in the positive direction;
and that after they have all been swept off by a few whisks we get
the true unimpaired reading     ]   I  believe that that is the   proper ex
 planation.
     On 12th December the surfaces were prepared          by rubbing     with
 dry bath brick and flannel.       Zinc, iron, and lead were positive at
 first j the zinc most, the iron next, and the lead least, and the zinc
 required the greatest amount of whisking to change it to negative.
     In  case of 13th December the discs were merely brushed with            *
 large soft brush before    beginning.      The zinc was at first slightly
 positive.    The readings were not so satisfactory as usual on account
 of imperfect insulation   due to very moist weather.
     On 14th December the discs were rubbed with              warm flannel.
 Only    the zinc and lead gave positive deflections,     the former more
 persistently than the latter.    The copper disc was then rubbed with
 sand paper, and the following series of obsorvations taken, the first

      The observations of 17th December,                  given in full in Table     II.,
   may be taken as illustrative of the other sets of observations.                  The
   morning was frosty, the stem insulated without                     being dried, the
   brush was heated slightly before beginning.                  The former series was
   taken   with   the discs as found     ;   and the latter, after the discs         had
   been   polished with emery paper and cleaned with                     flannel.   The
  order of entry is the order         in which the observations            were   made.
   It will be observed that the       initial and final       readings  for zinc in the
  first series are nearly equal, showing that the state of the brush was
  practically constant throughout               In   the case   of the second series,
  four readings were first taken, then the disc was whisked with the
  brush backwards and forwards across the middle zone about a dozen
  times, and then       six more readings were taken.                The order of the
 metals is the same, whether the former or latter mean of the second
 series is taken — zinc, lead, iron, copper,             tin,— and this order     agrees
 with that deduced from the entire collection of observations,                   except
 ing that lead is more negative than iron.
     The comparisons          entered      for    18th December were           obtained
 without     rubbing      the discs    previously.         The order is the same as
the latter       order of the previous days,               excepting that tin comes
out less than copper, which              I    believe to be erroneous.           On the
 19th the discs were previously rubbed with chamois                     leather.    Zinc
and lead        were    at first positive.          On these two days an         experi
ment was         made     with the zinc disc.            On the     former day it was
rubbed with emery paper and chamois                    leather, and the mean of the
first four readings was +111.               By    repeated whisking     it  was brought
down to zero, and changed to negative.                    The disc was again rubbed
with emery         paper   and chamois        leather, tested once, and found          to

   left untouched       till next   day.    When    tested next day    it  gave a read
   ing about        + 52,    and     after  considerable     whisking     the positive
  deflection     vanished      and     changed    to negative.     The result of this
  experiment        favours the idea that the positive electricity is duo to
  the existence       of minute particles on the surface of the disc.
      On 20th December further experiments                  were  made to elucidate
  the effect    of rubbing with         emery paper and      with  sand   paper.     The
  rubbing paper was attached to the end of a glass rod.

I    scratched the surface           of the zinc disc with emery paper          ;  when
the scratch was rubbed              with the brush positive electricity         was ob
tained,     but after     the scratches were rubbed a few times the electricity
became        negative.       This experiment indicates with what care ob
servations must be            made in this subject in order to obtain definite
 results.
     The fourth series of observations            were taken up with gold, silver,
nickel, bismuth,           antimony, aluminium, magnesium,            German silver.
The first three are in the form of discs of brass electroplated.                     The
aluminium         and magnesium         are cut out of thin sheet metal, and are
screwed       on to a disc of brass.         The electro-plates    were on the 20th,
21st,     and 27th compared with the disc of copper, but on the 28th
with    a   similar    electro-plate    of copper.     It  was found that the copper
electro-plate gave only two-thirds                 of the deflection given by the
copper disc       ;  the entries      for the previous days have been corrected
by multiplying by             f , the other discs      are compared     with   the disc
of copper.
     On 20th December the                electro-plates    were  rubbed with clean
chamois        leather before beginning,           and    they were whisked a few

 times with the brush before any readings                    were noted, as the deflec
 tions appeared too smalL                A   new brush was used.            Two     series of
 observations     were taken; in the former case the copper was observed
 before the electro-plates,          in the latter after the electro-plates.
    On    21st each disc was rubbed with chamois leather                       beforehand.
 The bismuth was null at the first whisk, the antimony was                        negative.
     On 27 th December an elaborate                   system of readings        was taken.
 The entries in Table         L    are deduced        from the following four            series

The electro-plates      had been lying in a cold room since the 21st,                      and
they were very moist when first taken up.                        This     moisture on the
surface     probably explains why the ratio of silver to copper and                          ef
nickel to copper,         changes       so considerably.         The other discs ww»
brought from        a  warm room.            I  consider that the positive             values
entered      are due to the existence of small particles                of some kind         on
the metal.
    The observations         taken      on the 28th are given in full in                   the
accompanying table (Table III.).                   After the first five readings the
disc was commonly whisked half a dozen times or so with the brush
used.      I  have marked when            this was done.          It   had the     effect    of
increasing the reading.             All the   discs were brought from home, and
a new    brush was used.            It will   be   observed     that the mean for           the
copper      electro-plate     is    less   than for the copper disc           ; the result
deduced       from the different ratios is              2 to 3.     In  the second series
only bismuth gave positive deflections,                  and these were soon changed
to negative.        Zinc was negative from tin; first, and repeated whisk

ing by the brush did              not alter the mean very much.                 The value
obtained,      42, does not differ much from the final mean, 45.                        This
result gives      strong support to the explanation given in this paper
of the      occasional     positive electricity          produced in zinc and some
other metals.

metals      comprised in the electro-frictional                 series;      it   belongs         to the
quadratic system.               Silver, gold, copper, iron, lead, which                 are found
together in the series, belong to the regular system of crystals                            ;     while
antimony, bismuth, zinc, magnesium,                      which are also found               together,
belong to the rhombic system.                       The last four metals              also agreed
in exhibiting          the greatest tendency to be positive at first.

        1.  On Distant Vision.             By E. E. Maddox, M.B.,            CM.
                     Communicated        by Prof. Crum Brown.
     I  believe    it is universally   assumed       by English physiologists that
  the zero    of accommodation is naturally associated with parallel visual
             in the " Primary Position
                                               "
  axes as                                         of Helmholtz, Listing, &c*
     It  is self-evident that when even            in actual life   a body is viewed
  at  infinite distance the visual axes must be parallel.                   It  is also
  well known that the nervous connection between                    convergence    and
  accommodation         is a most delicate       and susceptible one, and is none
 tho less so       naturally because     it  is capable of being overcome for a
 time by various           conditions.    It    is therefore    quite reasonable     to
 suppose       that when the ciliary         muscle      is at rest the converging
 mechanism should be so likewise             ;   and to expect that the invariable
 association      of  the visual actions of a life-timo should be impressed,
 if  not at birth, as Porterfield         suggested,
                                                           " by an original, connate,
 and immutable           law," at least    by " dint of habit," upon the very
 constitution of the governing ganglia.
     That this       is not the case will be evident from the following
 experiment       :— Let two small round           holes    be made through a piece
 of paper,       nearly two and a half inches apart.                Hold   them   hori
zontally about six inches          before    the face, and look through the left
hole     with the left eye at some very distant object.                  Four   images
now, of course, appear as shown in fig. 1.                  Each hole throws   a direct
image nearly upon the macula of its corresponding eye, and another
image obliquely           upon the outer part of the retina of the opposite
eye.       The appearance which results is represented in fig.           2.   The two
    * "
          In investigating the movements of tho eyes, we take as a normal point
of departure a position of the eyes which corresponds to a minimum of inner
vation of their muscles.       In this position, which is called the primary position,
the visual lines are directed      straight in front, parallel to each other, and in
the same horizontal plane." — Landolt.

direct images which fall nearly upon the retinal extremities of the
visual axes are mentally referred close to the middle line in obedience
to Bering's law (quoted and supported by Helmholtz), that points
looked at in space are referred to a line drawn from the root of the
noso    to  the junction       of the visual lines.      Thus the hole     A   may
bo referred     to c, and the hole         B to  d.  The two indirect images
are referred    to the outer     side of the hole which gives rise to them.

visual axis of its corresponding            eye, and were these axes parallel,

    it   With parallel axes, moreover, the position of the false images

left eye only is looking at         a  distant object, and accommodation may
not be entirely suspended           in the right eye, in spite of the assertion
of Bonders that        accommodative            effort   is always the same              in  each
eye.     This objection would          be met by the fact, that when the two
central images       are in the       same vertical line as               in fig. 4, distant
objects are seen in each which arc really separated by an appreciable
 horizontal interval.         It is difficult to represent natural objects

occurs    to  1°,   so that while      accommodated          for infinity,       the  eyes
direct their visual axes to a point nearly              12  feet distant         Suppose,
now, the eyes are accommodated                 for an object at the distance of
12    feet.   Surely now        the   accommodation          and convergence           will
coincide    !   Xo    ;  the right eye rolls         inwards     another 40'.          The
optic angle is therefore         1° 40'.     It   is easy to calculate        trigononie-
trically, knowing my own intercentral distance, that the visual                       axes
must now intersect rather more than                  7 feet   from the eyes, while
accommodation takes place for nearly 12 feet (11 feet 8).
    The slightest increase of accommodation                    is associated       with   a
sympathetic advance           of convergence,         and there      is a decreasing
interval between the two.            The excess of convergence             over accom
modation diminishes          as the   object of view approaches            till  a certain
point, when they both coincide.                This point in my own case* is
56 inches distant.          As the visual object approaches still nearer,
convergence       fails to keep pace with accommodation.                      With    each
increment of accommodation              throughout there is a corresponding
increment of convergence,            but a smaller one.           It   is like a long-
legged and a short-legged           competitor in a race, in which               both   are
bound to keep step, the short-legged                having a start, but the long-
legged     winning in the end.           Being somewhat          hypermetropic, my
convergence       would be expected to exceed my accommodation                       when
the latter is negative,      but strangely       I  have found the excess greater
in   most normal eyes         I   have   tried thau in my case, and to vary
from 4° to \°. I have not been able to experiment on many, but
I  have found it quite as much in one or two myopic patients.
    It  raises the question,       What is       the position of rest of the eyes
which they would assume in sleep               ?
    I  think it    may be accepted        as  extremely probable that it is the
natural condition of brain centres, at least those connected with the
eye, to evolve       some nerve energy, even in sleep.              It   is impossible
for most people to relax their ciliary muscle                 completely without           a
distant object to look at, and even the faculty claimed                          by some
oculists to be acquired           by training, is received         by their brethren
with much incredulity.               Evidently the degree of convergence,
though it does not coincide with accommodation, is closely affected

      by the latter.       It  may     altogether    be  laid aside that the primary
      position   of the eyes is that of rest        Landolt says — "     It  is impossible
      for any one who has not practised              to that end to give his eyes a
      direction    absolutely parallel, especially         in strabismus."         How    ho
     arrived    at this result    I  do not know, but probably with               the inge
     nious apparatus       of Javal, which requires a candle near the patient's
     face and a     dark room.
         Convergence without         any definite point of view, therefore,            must
     probably be considerable.           Even the centre for the contraction of the
     pupil by light, which is regarded             as a   typical example       of a reflex
    instead of a tonic ganglion during waking hours, is not improbably a
    tonic one naturally, for the pupil             is semi-contracted       during sleep,
    and dilates      the moment       a person wakes        up.    Whenever a distant
    object is viewed, impulses            must   ascend    from the retina to inhibit
    reflexly the ciliary muscle,          for it has no antagonist           It  is just  as
   easy to     extend the process to the centre for the contraction of the
   iris,   and suppose        that the activity       of some other       centre     exerts,
   during waking hours, an inhibition over the tonic moiety of nervous
   energy      for the sphincter pupilli.          This    indeed    might throw light
   upon the       Argyll Robertson symptom of locomotorataxia and spinal
  myosis in general.           It is impossible at present to decide, but             I  am
  inclined to believe that the position of rest for each person is that
 point of space for which accommodation                   and convergence       are equal.
 Opinions, however, will probably vary between this point and others
 at a greater distance,         but none will entertain parallelism.
      These facts increase the difficulty of ascertaining the exact inter-
 axial distance between             the two eyes; indeed,          the name would be
 better      changed to intercentral distance,           as  I have   taken the liberty
 of doing       in this   paper.    A   glance at fig. 8     will show that the condi
tions would not be altered                 in the least,    if  the holes    were drawn
out into two parallel tubes, since the object is at practically infinite
distance.          If  a screw were adapted to these tubes for their mutual
approximation,           or the reverse, they would resemble tho visuometer
for determining the interaxial distance.
     It   is conceivable that many             subjects   might aver that they saw
the same object through both tubes,                     when in reality the objects
were not completely fused.                 The error introduced is due to the fact

440                     Proceedings of the Royal Society
 that the principal optical centre of the dioptric apparatus is                      more
 than    7 mm.     anterior to the centre of rotation.              In   the following
 tahle   I   have   estimated     the degree of error for each            J° of   conver
gence    with distant vision.        It  is seen to be very trifling, and to        reach
 half a millimetre only with            4°  of convergence in emmetropia.               In
 myopia the error would be greater.

            1°          •12635 mm.                    4°           •5050 mm.
            r  30'        1895 mm.                    4°  3C         •568 mm.
            2°           •2527 mm.                    5°             •631 mm.
           2° 30'        •3158 mm.                    V   56'            1  mm.
           3°            ¦3789 mm.
    The error is avoided by the practice of shutting each eye in                    turn.
It   may be suggested that the eyes tend to take the position in which
their optic axes are parallel, rather than their visual axes, but thi*
would not account for the convergence                of myopes in which the two
axes coincide      ;  and in my own        case, convergence      in spite of hyper-
metropia is almost certainly less than the angle between the visual
axes by two or three          degrees at least.        The two conditions          sa far
seem to be quite independent.

     The experiments            described        in this paper were made in a small
 dust-box, blackened inside, glazed                        in front, and provided with                           a
 window at one side.                 For illumination two jets of                    gas enclosed in a
 dark lantern were used.                The light entered the dust-box by the side
 window, and could be condensed                         on any part of the inside                      of the
 box,     by    means     of two lenses fixed in a short tube, and loosely
 attached      to the front of the lantern.                   Magnifying            glasses of different
 powers were used for observation.                        The dusts experimented                      on were
 made,     some of hydrochloric              acid and ammonia                   ;    some by burning
 sulphur and adding ammonia                  ;   others by burning paper, magnesium,
 or sodium.        Calcined magnesia and lime were also used,                                    as    well as
 ground      charcoal.         These    three     last substances               were stirred up by
 means    of a jet of air.
     For testing the effects of slight differences of temperature,                                    tubes     in
some     form or other were generally used.                           These tubes               were closed
at   the front,         projected      through          the     back of the                dust-box,         and
were     brought close to the glass front, for observation under strong
magnifying power.                   The tubes          were     heated        or cooled           by circu
lating water through them                   in   a small tube passing                      through their
interior.
     Suppose the          experiments to be begun by introducing                                      a round
tube into        its   place    in    the dust-box, and               filling   the box           with any
dust,     everything        being then left for some time, so that all tho
apparatus       may acquire the same temperature.                             If     the light        be now
allowed      to fall on the box, and be quickly brought to a focus on the
tube,    it will   be found that the dust is in close contact                                   with      it,   on
the top and sides,             but underneath             a   clear    space        will    be observed         j
close examination           will show that            the particles are falling on the upper
surface    of the tube,         and    coming into contact with                       it,   while under
neath    a   clear space       is   formed       by   the particles falling away from it.
If the    tube    is   now slightly cooled,           a   downward current                 is   formed, and
the currents       of   dustless air from below the tube meet under                                    it,   and
form a dark plane in the centre of tho descending current                                                 It    is
shown that gravitation can, under favourable conditions, produce
this separation of the dust quickly enough                               to keep           up    a   constant
supply of dustless air.                No   increase of effect           is   produced by             a   lower
temperature.            A      temperature        of      - 10°   C. makes            the       dark plane

 442                    Proceedings      of tJu Royal Society
 thinner, because it increases tbe rate of the descending current, and
 carries away the purified air more quickly.
    A form of       apparatus      was arranged       to get    rid of this separating
 effect   of gravitation. It consisted of an                 extremely thin and flat
 piece    of metaL           This test-surface was           placed   vertically in the
 dust-box.     The air in passing over this piece of metal did not take
 up a horizontal movement             at any part of its passage.            The result
 was that even        with     a temperature       - 10°    C. the dust kept close to
 its surface, and no dark plane was formed in the descending current
 The dark plane in the cold descending                current seems, therefore,        not
 to be an effect of temperature,           but is the result of the action of gravi
tation on the particles under the body.                  A dark    plane was, however,
observed when working              with thia flat     surface,    when cooled    ;  but  it
 was not formed in dusty, but             in   foggy air, and was found to be due
to the evaporation of the fog particles when they approached                           the
cold surface.
    If a   very little heat, instead of cold,        as   in the previous experiment,
is applied to the round tube, then the dark space under the tube rises
and encircles the tube, and the two currents of clear air unite over
the tube, and form the dark plane in the upward current                            But  in
addition to this, heat has been found to exert a repelling effect ou
the dust.      This   was proved by putting the thin vertical test-surface
in  the dust-box, and beating           it  ;  when it was found that the dust
was     repelled    from      its surface,     and a dark plane formed in the
ascending     current    ;   neither of which effects was obtained with cold.
The dust begins to          be  repelled with the slightest rise of temperature,
and the dark space in front of the test-surface                    becomes    thicker as
the temperature        rises.     An experiment         is then    described   in which
the dust particles         in the air flowing up between             two parallel glass
plates    is caused     to pass from side to side of the channel by the
repelling action of hent at different points.
    For testing      the effects of higher temperatures                a platinum wire
heated     by means of         a  battery was used.           The platinum wire was
bent into      a  U-sliape, the two           legs being brought close together.
This wire     was fixed in the dust-box with the bend to the front, and
the legs in the same horizontal plane,                      the  two copper     wirvs to
which it was attached being earned                 backwards and out of the box.

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                               443
      By this arrangement      a clear view was obtained         all round      the wire,
     and other advantages      secured.       Experimenting      with this apparatus,
     it was   found that different kinds of dusts had different sized dark
     planes.    With    magnesia and other indestructible dusts,             it was very
    thin  ;  with  the sulphate dust,     it  was much thicker;       and with the sal-
    ammoniac dust, thicker still.           So thick was     it with     the two latter
    kinds of dust, that the dark planes over the two legs expanded                     and
    formed one plane.         As the particles could be seen streaming into the
   dark space under the wires,            it  was obvious that these large dark
   planes were not caused by repulsion, but by the evaporation or by the
   disintegration of the dust particles.            When making the experiment
   in a mixture of different kinds of dusts, the hot wire was surrounded
   by a series of zones of different brightness,         and having sharp outlines.
   The size of the different zones was determined by the temperature
  necessary to evaporate         the different kinds of dust present, and out
  side these zones was another caused by the evaporation of the water
  from the particles.
       The conclusions arrived at from these experiments are, that the
  downward dark plane is produced               by the separating action of gravi
  tation, in the space under the cold body, and that the upward dark
  plane     is produced — 1st, by the separating           action of gravitation           ;
  2nd, by the repulsion due to heat             ; 3rd,   by evaporation       ; and   4th,
 by disintegration.
      The effect of centrifugal force is considered.                It  is pointed out
 that    as  the air in its passage over a body such            as a tube, curves       as
 much in one direction         as  it does in   another, therefore any centrifugal
 effect produced in the one part will be reversed in the other.                        An
 experiment        is  described    in  which   an  air current    is  caused    to curve
 through 180 degrees in its passage round the edge of                      a thin plate,
 and without any curving in the opposite direction, but no decided
 centrifugal      action could be detected.
      The motions of      the dust particles produced        by the repulsion of the
hot surface suggested that electricity might play some part in these
phenomena.            Experiments were made to test this          :  the hot body was
insulated,        and connected        with    an  electroscope,     but no electrical
disturbance        was observed,       nor could any electrification be got from
the dust and hot air streaming               up fiom the hot wires.          The effects

444                     Proceedings     of  the   Royal Society
of electrification were studied by insulating                  and charging the hot
surface.      The effect was found to be the opposite of the heat                   effect.
If   the potential is slight and       the temperature         high, the heat is      able
to keep the       dust off the surface       of the body, and the dark              plane
distinct    ; but  if  the temperature     falls, or the potential is increased,           n
point is reached        when the electrical attraction overcomes                the heat
effect, and the dust particles break in upon and destroy the dark
space.
     It was observed       that after the dust particles were electrified            they
tended to deposit themselves           on an}- surface near them, and experi
ments were made to determine the                best conditions for purifying air
in this manner.          It  was found    to be best done by causing as rapid
a   discharge of electricity       as possible,     by means of points,          surfaces
being placed near them           to increase     the  electrification      of the    dust,
and to augment         the rate of the currents of air which were driven
from the points.          These surfaces became places on which the                   dust
deposited itself before losing its charge.           A  large flask was found to         be
rapidly cleared of        a cloud of dust by means of         a  point, the dust    being
almost entirely deposited on the inside surface of the flask.                      If   the
end of the conductor in the tlask             terminated in        a sphere,   but little
effect was produced.            Electricity    has also been found capable of
depositing the very fine dust of the atmosphere.                     The air in    a large
 fliisk was     purified much       more     quickly by        means    of the    electric
discharge      than it could have        been     by means of an air-pump               anil
cotton-wool filter.
     It  is shown that a wet and hot surface                repels    dust much      more
powerfully       than    a  hot dry one.        From this it is concluded              that
the heat      and moisture in our lungs exert             a   protecting influence       on
the surfaces of the bronchial tubes, and tend to keep the dust                            in
 the air, which       is ebbing and flowing through them, from coming
 into contact with their surfaces.            This   was illustrated       by placing      a
 hot and wet surface in a current of dense smoke, where it remained
 some time without receiving a speck of soot, while a similar surface,
 but cold, was blackened with the smoke.                     It  is pointed out, that
 on account       of the irregularities      on the surface of          the   tubes and
 of the more violent movements                of   the air     in  the   lungs, and      on

is not perfect           Still it  is thought that this repelling action at these
surfaces      must have same influence, and it seems possible it may
explain      some climatic effects, as        it  is evident that the lungs        will  he
ranch better         protected    in such places       as  Davos Platz, where the air
is cold and dry,          and    the repelling       forces   at a maximum, than at
places like Madeira, where the air                   is warm and       moist,   and   these
forces      are   at   a   minimum.         This point        can,   however,     only   bo
determined          satisfactorily      by anatomical         examinations      of   lungs
which      have lived under the different conditions.
     In   the experiments it was observed                that dust not only tended        to
move      away from hot surfaces, but also that it was attracted                   by cold
ones, and attached itself to them.                 To study this effect, glass plates
¦were   put in different positions near the hot platinum                    wire.     Very
beautiful impressions of             the dark plane can be obtained by placing
a piece of glass vertically and             transversely over the hot wire.            The
hot air in ilowing          over   the glass deposits its dust on the surface             of
the plate, leaving          a clear     line in the middle, indicating where the
dustless air of the dark plane had passed.                       In this way     the dust
is trapped      on the glass to which          it  adheres with some firmness,          and
not only      the impressions,        but the dark planes         themselves,   may thus
 be preserved.*
     Other    experiments, to study the repulsion and attraction of hot
and cold surfaces, were made by placing glass plates on both sides
 of the hot wire.         An interesting result         was obtained when the plates
 were   about      1   mm.    apart.      Using    magnesia      powder, the     particles
 could be seen rising in the current and approaching the hot wire                          ;
 they were      then observed         to be violently repelled towards the cold
 surfaces,    to which they adhered.              If   there was sufficient difference
 of temperature, not a single particle of dust was carried by the
 current past the hot wire.
     A thermic filter      is then described.           In this filter the air is passed
 through the space formed between two concentric tubes.                         One tube
 is kept cold by a stream of water, and the other heated by means of
 steam or a dame.           This instrument        was shown in action.          One end
    *                of these trapped dark planes           were   shown at the meeting.
      Specimens
 Some of them made of wliito powder deposited               on blackened  glass, others of
 charcoal   deposited   on opal glass.

 446                  Proceedings       of   the  Eoyal Society
 of the filter was connected with           a glass  flask, in which the condition
of the air was tested.         So long     as the difference      of temperature    was
 kept up, and the current not too rapid, the air passing through the
apparatus showed no signs of producing cloudy condensation                       on the
pressure being reduced, showing that the filter had trapped all, even
the invisible dust particles.
    Some experiments on the effect             of diffusion on     the distribution   of
dust at the surface of a diaphragm are described.                     Where carbonic
acid diffuses     into a space, the dust comes close to the diffusing
surface  ;  but  if hydrogen is      the diffusing gas, a clear space is formed
in front of the diaphragm.
   An explanation        is then offered        of the repulsion of dust by hot
surfaces, and     its attraction by cold ones.             It  seemed possible     that
the dust might        be repelled       in the same way           as  the vanes of a
Crooke's     radiometer,     by   a  radiation effect.         That this   is not the
true explanation was, however, proved by placing in the dust-box
a polished silver flat test-surface,          one half of which was coated         with
lamp black, when it was found that the dark space in front of the
lamp black       was no      thicker than that in            front of the polished
metal.     It  is thought that the repulsion is due to the diffusion                  of
the hot and cold air molecules.              The hot surface repels, because the
outward diffusing molecules are hot, and have greater kinetic energy
than the inward moving ones            ;  and as the side of the dust particle
next the hot surface          is   bombarded        by a larger number of hot
molecules     than the other side, it is driven away from the hot
surface.    The attraction of a cold surface              is explained by the lees
kinetic    energy     of   the   outward         than of      the   inward    diffusing
molecules.      Some experiments          are referred to, to show that the rate
at which gas molecules         diffuse    indicate that this diffusion effect is
sufficient to account for the repulsion and attraction of the dust
    If the explanation here given is correct, then the dust is repelled
in the same way       as the vanes       of   a radiometer     when placed in front
of a surface fixed inside the radiometer               bulb, and hotter than the
residual gas, — the principal       part of the energy producing the motion
being transferred from the hot surface                 to the repelled     surface   by
the kinetic energy of the molecules, aud not by radiation.

  deposit itself on cold surfaces, the following experiments                 were made.
  Two mirrors, one hot the other cold,               fixed face to face and at a
  distance of two or three millimetres from each other,                     wero  placed
  in  a vessel   filled with a denso cloud of magnesia, made by burning
  magnesium       wire.     After   a short time the mirrors          were taken out
  and examined.          The hot one was quite clean, while the cold one
  was white       with    magnesia      dust.    In another experiment            a cold
  metal rod was dipped into some hot magnesia powder                     ;   when taken
  out   it had     a  club-shaped mass of magnesia             adhering to its end,
  while a hot rod attracted none.
     This tendency of dust to            leave hot surfaces and attach itself            to
 cold    ones, explains a number of familiar               things, among others           it
 tells   us why the walls and furniture              of a stove-heated         room    are
 always     dirtier than those of a fire-warmed             one.     In    the one case
 the air is warmer than the surfaces,                and in the other the sur
 faces are warmer than the air.               This  effect of temperature        is even
 necessary to explain why so much soot collects                   in a chimney.          It
 explains something of the peculiar liquid-like movements of hot
 powders,     and perhaps something of the spheroidal condition.
     For practical application,           it is   suggested     that    this   effect    of
 temperature      might be made available in many chemical works for
the condensation of            fumes,    and   that   it might     also     be used    for
 trapping soot in chimneys.              A small trap of this kind          was shown.
It   consisted    of  a tall metal    tube or chimney, surrounded by another
tube    slightly    larger.    The products of combustion are taken up the
centre tube, and down the intervening space.                  The heat of the gases
is thus made to do its own filtering.               This    apparatus      being placed
over a smoky lamp,           it  trapped out most of the soot, and            deposited
it in the inside of the outer tube.              This   arrangement       of apparatus
is too delicate and troublesome for general use, and it is suggested
that    as  by simply cooling gases in presence of plenty of surface,
much of its dust is deposited, it might be possible and advantageous
under certain        conditions to purify air by heating and cooling                it    a
number of times, which could be done at a small expense by means
of regenerators.
    Experiments were also made by discharging electricity into the
smoke in a chimney.             This   also produced a marked diminution                in

448                          Proceedings          of the Royal Society
the blackness           of   the escaping smoke.                  The supply of electricity of
sufficiently high potential                 is,   however,    a    difficulty for the present.
        3.      The Remarkable Sunsets.                           By   Mr John Aitken.
     The very remarkable and beautiful                            sunsets     which have been so
frequent of late, in which the sky has been                             lit   up    with   a   wondrous
wealth of colouring, and with                      a   splendour more than earthly, has
given rise to much interest and speculation as to the cause of the
brilliant colouring.               According to one explanation, the effect                         is   pro
duced      by the       light becoming coloured in its passage through the
atmosphere          by       an    excess     of water vapour, or other absorbing
medium, at present                 in the air.            The other explanation                 is,      that
the effects are the result of                a     superabundance of atmospheric dust,
probably due to the late eruptions of Krakatoa and other volcanic
mountains.
     There seems to be             a   possibility        of determining by observations
which of these theories                is   the more         probable.         In all      the descrip
tions of the sunsets the point which                         is   most generally remarked on
is   the     immense         wealth of the various shades and tints of red.
Now,       if    dust   is   the    cause of these glowing                   sunset      colours,     then
there must be somewhere                 a    display of the colours complementary to
the reds     ;   because the dust acts, not by the selective                        absorption, and
destruction of the colours,                  but by       a   selective       dispersion of them.
The very small particles of dust in the atmosphere                                    stop the direct
course of the rays and reflect                    them    in all directions          ;    but the dust
particles are      so    very small, especially iu the upper regions, that they
are only capable of stopping, and reflecting,                          or scattering the rays              of
the blue end of the spectrum,                     while the red rays pass on unchecked.
There therefore ought to be somewhere                             in the sky        a   display of the
colours of the blue end of the spectrum.                               From the observations              I
have been able to make since this suggestion                             presented        itself,
                                                                                                I        find
that the display of blue and green colours                             is   quite   as    prominent a
feature of the late sunsets as the reds.
     Overhead the display of blue                    is   fuller than       I      have    ever seen       it
before; and        as    the sun       passes below the horizon, and the lower
stratum of air with its larger                      particles, which reflect white light,

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                              449
 cease to be     illuminated, the depth and fulness of the blue increases
in a very marked degree.              While    the sky is deep blue overhead             it
 will be observed that lower down the blue changes to blue-green,
and     in    some     cases to green,     the wonderful        greenness     sometimes
seen    in   a clear space in the sky being occasionally intensified by
contrast      with   a rose-coloured    cloud or haze alongside of it.
    These      considerations seem to point to dust              as   the cause of the
glowing colours of our late sunsets,               as  none of the colours are de
stroyed, but are simply sifted out and assorted, and the sunset colours
seem     to be produced       in the following way        :  When we look into the
clear blue sky overhead,           we see the     light selectively      reflected from
the small particles capable            of scattering only the colours of short
wave-lengths,         and we    see  only blue.       If in   the evening we gradu
ally lower our gaze, and look into the clear sky in any direction not
towards the sun, we will then              see  that the blue gradually changes
to blue-green, and           sometimes      even    to green,    and lower down it
passes     into white      or rose-colour     near the horizon, according to the
circumstances.           This  green would      seem to be produced in the             fol
lowing way        :   Suppose we are looking northwards, then the light
which enters           our atmosphere      from the west has, before it arrives
at the part of the sky into which we are looking, had much of its
blue     thrown      out by reflection,      and is therefore deficient in blue
light   ;  and the particles at that elevation are not large enough                     to
reflect the red, so only green            is reflected      by the sky, and the red
passes on.        When we look overhead, we also look through this green
stratum, so to speak, but the green is overpowered by the greater
 brilliancy      of the blue.        And, further, when looking upwards at
 only a slight angle, wo           see the light reflected        from a far greater
 amount of the green stratum than when looking through it towards
 the zenith.
    The fine particles of dust having thus scattered the blue and the
 gTeen    rays, only the red rays are allowed to pass on, and we see them
 reflected     on    the clouds far to the east of us,              as  well   as to the
 south and north.             Some    of the most beautiful and delicate              rose
 tints are formed by the air cooling and depositing its moisture
 on the dust, increasing the size of the particles                till they   are able to
 stop and reflect the rays of the red end of the spectrum,                     when the
 haze glows with a strange aurora-like light.

450                  Proceedings    of  the   Royal Society
    Another    peculiar feature of these sunsets is the very remarkable
amount of after-glow which has             sometimes      been    observed.        So
brilliant   is  this   after-light   that    to  many it      has   seemed      as  if
the light had       returned    and    increased     in  brilliancy.     This     im
pression is,    however, only subjective.            If we watch       the moon,
it will  be seen to become more          and more brilliant,        as the colour
phenomena change,         which     would     not    be  the case    if the    after
glow increased     the light.    The apparent increase          seems to be due
to   the sensitiveness of the eye            becoming     restored,    after being
fatigued by the bright light of day, and part of the apparent increased
brightness is due to the increased         sensitiveness   of the eye, and       part
is due to the illumination       becoming coloured.         These remarks        are,
of course, altogether apart from the wonderful              increase   of twilight
lately enjoyed, which has lengthened the day by nearly an                      hour,
and refer only to the apparent increase and return of the light.
   The increased amount of red light which fell on the earth at                  and
after sunset produced some very remarkable changes                 in the   appear
ance   of surrounding      objects,   causing     all red or reddish-coloured
objects to glow with a strange brightness, and destroyed the relation
of the colours of the different objects to which we are               accustomed.
Dead beech leaves, for instance,          which under ordinary conditions
of light are not conspicuous, shone out brightly.               But   perhaps the
most remarkable effect was observed           when looking down on          a town.
Most of the houses       were bathed      in   a  uniform    grey light   ; but all
the tiled roofs shone out brilliantly, and looked very much                    as if
 they hail just  been painted     with vermilion.

    At   the close of our last Session,        I undertook    to call the attention of
the Fellows at the commencement                  of the present      to the history of
the Royal          Society,   taking     as   my    theme   the    completion of its
hundredth        anniversary.       Circumstances       have   accidentally delayed
for    a  month or two the fulfilment uf that engagement                    ; but   I  now
proceed,      to the    best   of my power,       to discharge it.         It   is a very
wide theme, and it will at once occur to you that                    a   review of the
topics which have engaged              the attention of the Society during             that
period, rightly performed,           would be equally beyond my ability and
your patience.          I should    have    to speak an encyclopaedia,           in many
volumes.         I  can, however, but         attempt    some    desultory and frag
mentary reflections, which may not be devoid of interest, on
                                                                                      " the
Foundation         and the Founders of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,"
as    they appear       to us in    retrospect     through   a   vista of     a   hundred
years.
    There is no doubt now of our right to claim our centenarian
honours.         The Charter which we hold is dated on the 29th of March
 1783.       Several preliminary         meetings    were  held for the election of
 office-bearers      and the enactment of bye-laws,            but the fust meeting
 for the transaction of business was held on the 8th of December 1783.
 So that, had       I been able     to accomplish my        ta.sk as   I  had intended,
 on the 4th of December 1883,               I should have invited your attention
 to the proposed        review,  as  nearly as might be, on the completion of a
 century of operative life on the part of the Royal Society.
     I  think    we may look back on that long history with pride,                    with
 pleasure, and       with profit.     The attainment of this centenarian              mile
  stone   in the life of     man,     or of nations, or of institutions, always
  brings   with it     an element       of sentiment — a suggestion          both of per-

 452                  Proceedings       of the Royal Society
 manence and of change, which surrounds                it with  interest.    It points
 to a commencement         which probably no survivor recollects, and even
 in  periods   the least    eventful, its long roll of expectations,            efforts,
 and vicissitudes cannot be regarded               without    a share    of emotion.
 But   the century along which           I  invite you to look back to-night is
 so crowded with         events   in   the   political and social history of the
 world, that its commencement             shades     obscurely away into the past.
 Since that day in dim December,              when our great predecessors first
gathered     together,   under the shadow of their new Charter, all that
was greatest and brightest in Scottish              intellect at that time, what        a
marvellous wave of change has swept over the civilised world.                        The
echoes of 1783 come to us as from the distant past, and range                       with
the historic, not      with   the present.        We think of       the   Mirror and
the   Lounger, rather        as  the    contemporaries       of the Spectator        and
the Tatler,     than of ourselves,         as   though they had been the in
habitants of a different sphere from that in which we find ourselves
to-day.
    Such is the instinctive feeling which first arises in the mind when
we try to span      in thought the interval          between   then and now      ;  and
so  I felt  when   I  began my preparation for my duty            tonight.      I have
in  the course   of it  been  living with the      great men of former days, as I
find their thoughts recorded            in our    annals.     I have gone over our
Transactions for the first fifty years of the existence of the Society,
and have risen from my task deeply impressed                     by the wealth of
cultivated ability which that repertory contains.                   I  mean    to ask
you to-night to accompany             me   in rather     a rapid journey over that
period, along with some of the best travelling companions which
Scotland ever saw.          As    I  became     familiar    with details,    and     the
actual personality of the men,          I found     tho apparent distance percep
tibly diminish, and began to think the century not so wide a                   chasm
after alL This impression was heightened by finding, when                      I   took
my leave of our office-bearers at the comparatively modern half-way
house    of  1830, that three of them,           at least, had accompanied           me
all  the way.      They were Henry Mackenzie, Baron Hume, and Sir
William Miller of Glonlee.
    Long or short, however,         as   it may seem to us in reflection, th*
century has witnessed signal changes,              and   many momentous events
have been crowded into it.          Many stormy days and nights must have

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                              453
   been witnessed by our founders.              The Fellows of the Eoyal Society,
   no doubt, in its philosophic retreat, know nothing of politics —
                          "Quid Tiridatem        terreat unico
                            Securi."
  Nevertheless,    since   its meetings         commenced,      the changes     on the
  world's chess-board     have    been numberless,           and there is something
  impressive,   if  perhaps     almost      incongruous, in finding        the   Eoyal
  Society meeting quietly month after month in those first days of
  palpitation   and alarm,       as   if utterly      unconscious    of the tempest
  which was raging without.            The end of their first decade brought
  them to the deepest horrors of the first French                  Eevolution.     The
  end  of the   second, in 1803,         saw the whole country armed            to the
  teeth on the rupture of the Peace              of Amiens.       At the  end of the
 third, Europe, after ten years of warfare and bloodshed,                    had not
 reached,   although it approached,             the crisis of Waterloo.        Yet  we
 could not have discovered         from these records of learning what start
 ling events were passing        outside,      while our forefathers discussed a
 geometrical problem, or pondered              and disputed over the topography
 of the Troad.
    Yet, regarding this long interval from the watch-tower of the
 Eoyal Society,     I  can trace within          the century a revolution more
 wonderful     and more      extensive than monarchies,              or empires,    or
 republics can display.         Since this Society held its first meeting,
 how great to the community has been the                  fruit gathered from those
 branches   of knowledge which              it   was   incorporated to prosecute      1
During that interval, what          has science not done for human comfort
and happiness     1   What interest        so great, what dwelling so humble,
as  not to have felt its beneficent influence            ?   Since the invention of
the art of printing, no such advance             in material    comfort, prosperity,
and intellgence has ever been made                within    a similar period as this
century has witnessed.         Its triumphs        have not been confined      to the
more abstruse fields of thought and study, but have come straight to
the world     of everyday life.        I   need not go over the familiar         cata
logue ;   but one homely illustration            meets me on the threshold of
the opening- night    ; and homely things            go deep into the foundations
of human life.      I picture    to myself our founders wending their way
to the College Library, through close and wynd, in mid winter 1783,

454                   Proceedings     of the Royal       Society
while flickering oil-lamps made the darkness visible without, and a
detestable     tallow candle made the student miserable               within     doors.
Those who cannot recollect the universal reign of tallow candles and
their snuffers cannot appreciate how much the sum of human enjoy
ment has been enhanced,           and  the tranquillity      of human temper in
creased, by the transmutation — partial, we must admit —of darkness
 into light.      There has been,      I  believe,    no   more    potent    agent     in
 humanising the denizens of our large cities than the flood of light
 which chemical        science   has in our day poured          into their recesses.
 The ingenious author of the diverting volume                   on the Miseries        of
 Human       Life, published,     I think, about      1812     or  1814, was       quite
right in uttering one of his deepest groans over the illuminating
 horrors    of that   age of   darkness.     It  does not detract      from the pic
 ture that, great as have been the triumphs of gas light,             it  is said even
 now to totter on its throne, and prophets            tell us that before the end
 of the century which we now begin, it will probably have followed
 the tallow candles        into the same unlamented           obscurity.      Prophets
 are not agreed about this ; but even should this be so, history                     will
 carry to its credit the vast amount of public utility, and the many
  hours of useful employment         or comfort     in the factory, the study, or
  the sick room, which         this simple    application of chemical           science
  gained in its day for the nineteenth          century.
      But the dispersion      of material   darkness     is but a slender      illustra
  tion of the triumphs of scientific       discovery.       Time and space are no
  longer the tyrants they were in 1783.                I  rather   think that when
  our founders first met, they could hardly hope to hear by post from
   London under ten days, as Palmer's mail coaches had not begun to
  run until 1789.        It  would be an interesting inquiry,            if  my limits
   permitted,   to trace the moral and social effects of the change                 from
   the days when a London letter took even three days to reach                     Edin
   burgh, and cost 13Jd          Lord Cockburn lamented over the prospect
   of London being within fifteen hours of Edinburgh, as endangering
   the characteristics of our social) community.              His sagacity was not
   altogether   at fault, but even that time has been reduced by a third,
    and  I rather think     we and the world are all the better of the change.
    But   although larger victories were in store            for the century, th*y
    came slowly.      Both Boulton and James Watt were original mem
    bers of the Koyal Society,      but  it was more than thirty years Wion?

                         of Edinburgh,          Session    1883-84                            455
steam navigation         became general, and more than fifty before the first
passenger      railway     train ran         in Scotland.           No      doubt,      in 1791,
Erasmus Darwin, in his                " Botanic Garden,"           a poem too little read,
had exclaimed        in the well-known lines,—
                " Soon shall thy arm, unconquered                  Bteam, afar
                  Drag the slow barge, and urge the flying car."
The fame of the elder              Darwin has been eclipsed                  by his younger
relative ; but he deserves            to be remembered             if it   were only for the
fact that he was         the companion,          friend, and adviser of James Watt,
in whose genius he was an enthusiastic                    believer,     and from whom he
probably drew the inspiration                    which     prompted          tho   lines.     The
genius of James          Watt and         George Stephenson           has changed all this,
and,   in    changing     it,   altered    the conditions both of public and of
private life throughout the world.                   Darwin was not the only man
of that time who looked forward with confidence                               to the ultimate
victories of steam.             Godwin, in his work, published in 1793, en
titled Political Justice,         a   book full of bold,        if    very doubtful specu
lation, argues that since the discovery of the steam engine,                                   the
amount of manual           labour required          for the cultivation of the land
was certain to be diminished.                    He says, in        a   passage which has
been often referred to — " Hereafter,               it   is   by no means clear that the
most extensive       operations       will not     be within the reach of one man                 ;
or, to make       use of    a     familiar instance, that          a    plough     may not be
turned into     a   field and perform its office without the need of super
intendence.         It   was    in this sense," ho continues,                 "that     the cele
brated       Franklin     conjectured          that mind would              one    day become
omnipotent        over    matter,"        and    now that the              locomotive       carries
mankind to all ends of the earth, Godwin's sanguine                                   suggestion
has been all but realised.
  There has been during this interval                a    still more powerful magician
at work.        To this audience      I     need not dwell on the triumphs of the
future ruler of the world of science — electricity.                          But one illustra
tion
   I        may be permitted.             Franklin was one of the first of the non
resident members elected by the Eoyal Society of Edinburgh.                                  How
little   he thought when many years before he drew the electric spark
from the cloud, that before                a    hundred years had sped, his experi
ment, but slightly modified, might convey                      a   message from       a   meeting

 456                     Proceedings      of the Royal     Society
 of the Society in Edinburgh to one of its Fellows in Sew York, and
 bring back an answer before the meeting separated.
     In slightly alluding         to this scientific revolution, my object has
 been partly to illustrate the surroundings of 1 783, and also to re
 mind my hearers that of all the changes                  the century has seen, far
 the most important, and the deepest, have been the work of science.
 Increased     facilities for inter-communication carry with them a com
 plete change in the economical            aud social condition of the communi
 ties they affect.          New wants, new customers, new ambitions, new
possibilities, follow         in their train by the operation            of inevitable
laws.      What     was a luxury        before    becomes    an ordinary necessity
thereafter.       What       was in fashion is       obsolete,   and what       6eemed
chimerical may be accomplished                  By this    talisman   we have seen,
perhaps sometimes without due appreciation,                  many a social problem
solved which had before seemed hopeless ; and although in the pro
cess   of transition some period of adaptation               may be necessary, and
some temporary          hardship endured, the result in all           cases   must   be
beneficent,     and    is at all events     beyond    the power     of lawgivers      lo
control or to resist.
    These last remarks         are not    without an application to that circle
of remarkable       Scotsmen      who constituted     the Founders of the Royal
Society.       They were not only prominent by intellect and cultiva
tion, but they wore each characteristic               and   distinctive.     It  would
be as impossible           to reproduce     that circle    now, as    to restore    the
ancient    lineaments,       and Continental      aspect, and Continental usages
of the ancestral         city where they flourished.          Although the exodus
to the     North     had     already   commenced,       we do     not  associate    the
Founders of the Koyal Society of Edinburgh with the Edinburgh
of to-day, but with the tall tenements, the wynds                    and closes, the
densely     packed      hive of educated       and   learned    Scotsmen,    as  Gold
smith or Johnson           found it  ; as  it  was in the early days of Karnes
and Monboddo, with             its afternoon    tea-drinkings and club suppers.
The century which has changed               so  much   lias changed these things
also.    As far    as external     conditions go, no revolution could be niorv
complete.        It  has been a change           from cultivated homeliness          to
splendour,      from frugal although dignified economy                  to  as   much
domestic      luxury      as  any community in Europe enjoys.               While in
1801 tho whole          population of Edinburgh was little over            CO, 000,   h

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                               457
   amounted by the census          of 1881 to 230,000, spread over an area
   nearly ten times the former in superficial            extent, and furnishing in
   every quarter splendid examples          of urban architecture.
     The Royal        Society   itself was the culmination of that signal
  reviviscence    of literary enthusiasm        and power, which, to her own
  astonishment      and that of the world, took place in Scotland                in the
  second half of the eighteenth           century.     Stunned at its commence
  ment by the      removal    of the legislature,      and all the social prestige
  which    the seat of a legislature       enjoys,   speaking     a language     which
  ultra-patriotic Scotsmen        still think    the more classic       of the      two,
  but still barbarous      in Southern ears, the educated Scot set himself
  with the energy of a Border chief to try           if  he could not invade the
 territory   of his neighbour across the Tweed in the world of letters,
 With what measure of rapid success the daring attempt was crowned
 the names     of David Hume, Adam Smith, and William Robertson
 attest  to this day.      How it came that a knot of Scots philosophers,
 who used their own vernacular in familiar intercourse,                  should have
 become    examples,    not of thought only, but of style, to Englishmen,
 might    admit of more detailed          illustration    than   I  can give it here.
 But very soon these literary chiefs from the North became famous and
 popular among London           men    of letters,  as  well  as   with the public.
 I find   David Hume writing from London to Adam Smith                         on the
publication of his Theory of Moral Sentiments in 1759, " that                  he had
sent a copy of the book to some of his acquaintances, and                      among
                                                              " and
the rest to Lord Ly ttleton and Horace Walpole ;                       to Mr   Burke,
an Irish gentleman, he says,
                                      " who has lately written a very           pretty
treatise on the Sublime."          On the other hand, in Mr Cosmo Innes'
pleasant     Memoir of Profesxor Dalzel, who,            as  we shall see, was a
member, and one of the secretaries of the Royal Society                  at its foun
dation, he quotes a letter from the Professor to Sir Robert Liston in
1776, in which he says — "There              is published    also a first    volume,
quarto, of a History       of the  Decline and     Fall   of the Roman Empire,
by Edward Gibbon, Esq., a member of Parliament," an expression
which may well be placed alongside              of Hume's reference to " Mr
Burke     as an   Irish   gentleman."       A   month before, in April 1776,
this  same    Mr Gibbon      wrote   to Dr Adam Ferguson           from London      —
"  I have always looked up with the most sincere respect towards                   the
northern     part of our island, whither taste and philosophy seemed to

458                        Proceedings of the IioyaJ          {Society
have retired from the smoke and hurry of this immense capital"
He goes on to say, " What an excellent work is that with which
our common friend, Mr Adam Smith, has enriched the public — an
extensive       science in a single book, and the most profound ideas ex
pressed in the most perspicuous               language."       In   1776 we find Adam
Smith a member             of the " Club," founded in London                  by Johnson
and     Goldsmith ; and          the   following      lines by Dr Barnard            (I    quote
from Dugald Stewart's Life of Smith, read to the Royal Society)
indicate a position of respect in that circle :—
                    "   If I have thoughts, and can't express 'em,
                        Gibbon shall teach me how to dress 'em
                           In words select and terse.
                        Jones teach me modesty and Greek,
                        Smith how to think, Burke how to speak,
                           And Beauclerk to converse."
   I   was amused to find that the admission                 of Smith to the " Club
                                                                                    "
excited the intense jealousy of James Boswell, who, in a letter                                   to
Mr     Temple,      one of those       published a few years             ago— says        loftily,
" Smith too is now of our Club.                  It   has lost its select    merit"
   It     is,   however,    to   Dr Robertson         and   Lord    Karnes    that we           are
mainly indebted             for the idea of the Royal Society,                and for          the
successful       issue of the project.         It   sprung partly, of course, out                  of
the example of the Royal Society                    of London.       But its immediate
antecedent        was the Philosophical          Society,    which had been founded
nearly fifty years before by the celebrated                   M'Laurin,      and contained
many distinguished names.                   Lord Karnes      became its president,             and
 raised    it    to considerable       distinction, both in science and literature,
 although that vigorous            and versatile      thinker and writer did not live
 to witness        the commencement           of the new institution.           Dr    Robert
 son's plan was to absorb this Society                 and all its members in              a   new
 Institute, on the model of the Berlin Academy                      of Sciences, for              tiie
 prosecution        both of Physical Science and of Literature.
  I     find from the minutes of the first meeting that the Society                            wero
 of opinion that the College                Library was an inconvenient place                     for
 their usual meetings, and              a   committee       was appointed       to find on*
 more suitable,          apparently    without success, for they continued                   to    I*
 held in the library for twenty-three years, when the Society migrated
 to the Physicians' Hall in George Street in 1807.    They afterward

                      of Edinburgh, Session          1883-84.                       459
purchased      No. 40 George      Street, in which the meetings            were held
until they obtained        their present rooms in the Royal Institution.
At   a subsequent     meeting,   held on the 4th of August              1 783,   it  was
resolved that the Society should be divided into two classes, which
should     meet and     deliberate    separately,    to be called      the    Physical
Class,    and   the Literary    class, with separate office-bearers.              But   I
have     detained    you too long on       the    threshold by this desultory
exordium.        Let   us   now   draw up       the curtain,      and display the
Founders of the Royal Society.
    The first President was Henry,             Duke of Buccleuch, who had
rendered      great   assistance    in obtaining the         Charter.      The     Vice-
Presidents were the Right Hon. Henry Dundas, and Sir Thomas
Miller, the Lord Justice-Clerk.
    I  forbear to go over the names of what may               be called the    original
members       of the Society.        I  include in that term all who were
elected within the first ten years.           All   the   members of the          Philo
sophical     were   assumed    without ballot      ; the   rest, to the number         of
more than a hundred, were elected              by ballot, and a general          invita
tion    was   made to the     Lords of Session to join.            These     were    the
ordinary     resident   members.       There was also a list of non-resident
members, which comprised nearly as many.                 Of the ordinary resident
members there is hardly a name which is not known —                      I might     say
conspicuous,      in the annals of Scotland at that time.             Twelve of the
 Lords of Session         accepted     the  invitation,     including      the     Lord-
 President, the Lord Justice-Clerk,          and the Lord Chief Baron of the
 day ; upwards of twenty professors,              with Principal       Robertson at
 their head ; twenty-two members of the Bar, including                Sir Hay    Camp
 bell, the Lord     Advocate — and of these at least fourteen               rose after
 wards     to the    bench ;    the    medical    contingent included Monro,
 Gregory, Cullen, and Home ; and the non-resident                 list contained the
 names of the Duke of Buccleuch, the Earl                  of Morton, the Earl of
 Bute, the Earl of Selkirk,        Lord Daer, James Stuart Mackenzie,                 the
 Lord Privy Seal, Sir George Clerk Maxwell of Penicuick, Sir James
  Hall of Dunglass, and many other familiar names.                      But    1   select
  from the list those of the members on whom fell the burden of the
  real work ; and     I  venture   to say that no city in Europe could have
  brought    together    a more    distinguished      circle.     They were — Hay
   Campbell,   Henry Dundas, Joseph Black, James Hutton, John Play

    460                   Proceedings      of the Royal      Society
    fair,  Adam      Smith,    "William Robertson, Dugald              Stewart,    Adam
    Fergusson,    Alexander Monro (secundus), James Gregory, Henry Mac
    kenzie,   Allan   Maconochie, and William Miller of Glenlee.              I ought to
   add to these     Sir James Hall of Dunglass and Sir George Maxwell of
   Penicuick.        Some    of these names are European, all are celebrated,
   and these were men who for the most part did not merely contribute
   the lustre of       their names      to   the   infant association,    but lent the
   practical vigour of their great intellectual power to aid in the first
   steps of its progress.       And    very soon the impress         thus stamped on
   the Society      began to establish        its reputation in the world, and it
   took no undistinguished place among the learned societies of Europe.
   I find   the names of Goethe and            Buffon among the original foreign
   members ; and although the events of the next twenty years                      inter
 rupted our relations with the Continent, by the time the Society had
  completed the half century,         there was scarcely a distinguished savant
   in Europe who had not joined or been invited into our ranks.
       In  the physical class were four men who              rose to great positions
  in the scientific       world, and       to   whom     the  Society were       greatly
  indebted       for its     general    reputation,     and    for   the   vigour and
 efficiency      with   which their proceedings           commenced.        They were
 James Hutton, Joseph Black, John                  Playfair, and Dugald        Stewart.
 Hutton and Black were then in the zenith of their fame, and have
 left a strong impress on the first years of our Society.                 Hutton was
 a most assiduous        and energetic member.            He had the distinction in
 the      very first volume       of   the     Transactions of lighting up two
 scientific    conflagrations    which blazed fiercely throughout Europe for
 many       years   afterwards.      One was his theory           of the earth, over
 which the Neptunists and Vulcanists fought with much fury, and
 the flames of which are perhaps not altogether                  extinct.    Much has
 been learned on these subjects            since that time.       Whether the world
 of geology has been fused into                a coherent   mass by reason of this
 combustion       I   need not inquire.         There have been theories         of the
 earth     since   then, and    possibly the slumbering embers may be re
kindled.        The other controversy           was of narrower      dimensions,    and
related to a paper of Hutton's on the              "Theory of Rain," which          was
strongly attacked         by M. de Luc,          a  French philosopher, and de
fended       by Hutton      in the Transactions with not a little asperity.
That Huttou           should have succeeded           in the    very   outset   of the

                                 of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                        461
Society's labours                in setting     the philosophers           of Europe by the ears,
first about the fires beneath                    the earth, and secondly              about      the rain
which falls from                  the   heavens, is creditable              at least to his energy.
Into the merits of these controversies                              it   is no part of my province
to   inquire       ;   but   I    am desirous,          in this review of the Society's            early
days, to revert with gratitude                      and respect            to the memory          of one
whose labours on behalf of the                             Society were invaluable.                From
1783       until       bis death        in 1797          not    a year     went by in which our
Transactions             were not enriched              by his vigorous conceptions.
     Hutton was an observer                      and a thinker of remarkable               originality
and power.               He had been a lawyer,                 a medical     practitioner,    a farmer,
and an agriculturist, before                     he became          known       as   a natural philo
sopher.        Vigorous            in thought and full of enthusiasm,                   he is said to
have been              as brilliant      in conversation             as    he was obscure         in his
written style.               Professor Playfair            did for Hutton's theory of the
earth      what Dumont did for Bentham, and rendered his strong but
obscurely expressed reasoning                      into clear and pellucid language.
     I   ought,        in justice       to his great        services       to the Society,       and his
undoubted              ability, to have coupled with the name of Hutton that
of Sir James              Hall of Dunglass, who                 was one of our most energetic
members, and held the                        position    of President for many years.                  He
was a      friend and admirer                  of Hutton's, but,           as   he tells   us,   was at
first entirely incredulous as to his theory of the earth, and                                     it   was
only by the charm of his conversation,                              and verbal       explanations far
more       lucid than his written style, that he at last adopted                            his views.
It,      however,       occurred        to    Hall that        if   heat    and pressure had pro
duced       the effects attributed to them                       by Hutton, the truth of the
theory might be tested by actual                          experiment.           Hutton discouraged
this view, thinking that the                      heat     to which these appearances were
due must have been so much                        more intense than any which could bo
artificially       produced,         that no satisfactory            results could be hoped for.
Hall had       so much            respect for his friend that he refrained from any
public notice             of his experiments               during Hutton's life; but after
Hutton's death in 1797                       resumed     them with great ardour, and com
municated the results in two papers read to the Society — one on tho
composition             of Whinstone and Lava, read in 1798, and                            a    second
most elaborate account                  of upwards of five hundred experiments, read
in    1805.        These experiments               were conducted            with immense         perse

402                     Proceedings of the Royal Society
verance,     considerable        expense,      and    varying results.         They     have,
however,      not been without fame and favour in the scientific world,
for   I found, in the library of the Society,               thanks to the attention of
our Librarian,      a   work and an accompanying                   letter which indicate
more powerfully than any words                   of mine       could    do, what interest
and importance        is still attached       to the results of his experiments            by
men of science on           the Continent           The letter is addressed           to the
President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh by M. Daubree, who
therein     mentions      that he is President of the Academy of                    Sciences
of the Institute         of France     ;   it   is  dated     in June 1879, and          was
received     by my predecessor           in the chair.          It   is in the following
terms    (I  translate     the substance of it).            He requests the President
to beg of the Society to accept                from him a copy of a work which
he is in       the course       of publishing,        entitled    Synthetic     Studies    '»
 Experimental Geology.             He proceeds — "         It   was on the soil of Scot
land that the powerful and fertile genius of Hutton was inspired,
and it was in the Transactions of your celebrated Society that
James Hall published in the beginning of the century two papers
of high importance              to experimental geology.                  My expression
of gratitude       (hommaye)        is thus not without good                reason."     The
work     itself   is    a    record    of    a    series   of    most elaborate      experi
ments, proceeding          avowedly on Hutton's theory, and on the lines
of Hall,     accompanied         by illustrative drawings,           and intended     to ex
hibit the effects of various mechanical                  agents    in combination        with
heat or fusion on the materials of the crust of the earth.
    The scientific merit of these views              I do not pretend        to judge ; but
it  is at least a striking tribute to our Founders to find that their
labours    at the    commencement             of the century should be            so  highly
appreciated      by the world at large close on the end of it.
     Black, again,     was a Frenchman by birth, although his parents
were    British, and        he was     nearly related         to Adam       Smith and       to
Adam Ferguson.             He came to Scotland when                 he was about twelve
years old, and long           before the institution          of the Royal Society         b<
 had risen to the front rank of European                 chemists ; his discoveries        on
pneumatic       chemistry and latent heat having laid the foundation                        of
much      that is valuable in subsequent investigations,                     and opened      a
course     of inquiry       pursued     with great ability in our own Transac
 tions by Leslie, and Brewster,             and Forbes.         He took    a great inter**:

in   the Society,        although he only contributed one paper of importance,
on    "The Hot Springs of Iceland."                       But no man has left a greater
reputation behind him.                  I   have   said    that    Black was a relative            of
Adam Smith, who was on terms                        of the greatest intimacy with him
and Hutton, and loved nothing so much as to get the philosophers
together at what he called an Oyster                      Club, and listen to their talk.
He appointed             Black and Hutton           as   his joint-executors.             Ferguson
was also a relative, and Cockburn sketches what he recollects of
each.  He says of Ferguson —
                              "                     I
                                 never heard of his dining out
except at his relative Joseph Black's, where his son,                                Sir Adam    (the
friend of Scott) used to say it was delightful                           to see the two philo
sophers      rioting over        a    boiled turnip."             Cockburn used to watch
Joseph Black from his father's                     house in George Square,                and thus
describes     him :—
     " He was       a    striking and beautiful person                  ;   tall, very thin, and
cadaverously            pale ; his hair carefully powdered,                  although there was
little of    it,   excepting     what was collected               into      a   long thin queue     ;
his eyes dark, clear, and large, like deep pools of pure water.      He
wore black speckless clothes, silk stockings, silver buckles, and either
a    slim   green silk umbrella or             a   genteel    brown cane.              The general
air and frame were feeble                   and slender.          The wildest boy respected
Black.       No boy could            be irreverent        towards       a    man     so pale, so ele
gant, and          so    illustrious.        So he glided like           a      spirit through our
rather mischievous sportivencss                    unharmed."
     The two others        I   have mentioned             were too famous in their day,
and are so still, to require to be,                      or to admit of being, described
here.       John Play fair       and Dugald Stewart were men who                          by them
selves      could have raised               to distinction        any       circle   to which they
belonged.          Both of them were men of great versatility, and within
the walls of the Royal Society capable                        of filling         a   foremost   place,
whether       in the fields          of exact science or in those of literature or
mental philosophy.
      Dugald Stewart's           contributions to the              Transactions are not             so
numerous as those of Playfair, but no man had                                   more influence      in
moulding the tone and cast of thought prevalent                                 amongst the culti
vated class             of his countrymen          than that most popular and most
 eloquent instructor of youth.

     But no one can study these volumes                   of the Transactions,    as   I
 have    done,     without feeling that for the first two decades of                the
 existence      of the Eoyal Society Playfair was the soul and life of              the
 institution.       His versatility    and   power      have   impressed    me exceed
 ingly, high as was the estimate               I   had   previously formed of     him.
 Profound and transparently clear, whatever                  might   be  the topic,  he
 bears about him a fiir-Teaching          vigour which never flags.          'Whether
 it be the Origin and Investigation             of Porisms, or the Astronomy         of
 the Brahmins, or their Trigonometrical Calculations or Meteorological
 Tables, or a Double Rainbow, nothing seems too great or too small for
 him.     Some of his obituary notices are fine pieces of English com
 position   ;  in particular, his notice of Dr William Stewart and of
 Hutton, and his fragment on John Clerk of Eldin, which is printed
 in the ninth volume of the Transactions.
    In  looking through the list of members towards                   the commence
ment of the         Society, two attracted         my attention — from no special
connection       between     them,   excepting      that they both     were members
of Johnson's Club, and both were celebrated in Goldsmith's poem
of " Retaliation."         The first was one which, by itself, was sufikient
to confer      distinction on any assembly, however distinguished, that
of Edmund Burke, who, according                 to Goldsmith's cynical lines—
               "  Born far the universe,  narrowed     his mind,
                  And so partly gave np what was meant for mankind."
When      I  first observed the name,        I  wondered      through what channel
the   great     Irishman came into that company.                  Dalzel's Memoirs,
however,      make that clear.        Burke was that year (1784) Lord Rector
of Glasgow        University, and on his return from his installation paid
a visit to Lord        Maitland     at Hatton       House,   and there    Dalzel  met
him, was charmed          by his conversation,          and recruited    him for the
Royal Society.         I  am not aware that he was in Edinburgh on any
other occasion.        Dalzel writes to Sir Robert Liston on the 20th of
April   1784 — "Our Royal            Society     is going   on extremely     welL     I
have proposed        Mr Burke     and you      as new members."          Next  month
he informs Liston           that he was unanimously chosen                a  member,
"which,"       he says,    "was not the case with Mr Burke. He was
chosen, hut not       unanimously      — there were several black balk ; " and
the Professor proceeds to moralise on the occasion.                     There is no

                           of Edinburgh,               Session          1883-84.                              465
 need that we should do so.                     It    is not in the least surprising that in
those days the very fact of his renown should have induced one or
two men      in   any assemblage to doubt whether, born for the universe or
no, he was specially bom for the Royal Society ; and had the event
occurred      ten      years      later,       the    discontented             might have been                    as
numerous,         but it   is possible         they might not have been the same.
     The other name, although well entitled to remembrance                                              on ac
count of its owner's accomplishments                          and learning,             owes its principal
notoriety      now to Goldsmith's gibe.                            It     was that of Caleb             Whit-
foord   — the      merry Whitefoord                  of the    "    Retaliation"          — of    whom        the
author says —
                                           " For thy     sake      I'll   admit,
              That a Scot may have hnmour,                    I    had almost said wit."
Now, Goldsmith had a very genuine vein of wit and                                              humour him
self, as    all the world knows, and was                            a very good            judge of it in
others.      It   must not be supposed                   that his knowledge of Scotsmen
was confined to those he                    encountered             south of the Tweed,                 for he
spent one year at least,              I    rather       think          two, in 1752, as a medical
student in Edinburgh, attended Dr Monro secundus, and                                                  was,       as
Mr Foreter in his Life tell us, a friend of Joseph Black's.                                            If   so,   I
cannot     help thinking            he      must have              neglected        his opportunities,
if   he found no humour                   in   the circle          in which Black moved.                          I
have not time to unravel the mystery of Goldsmith's life in Edinburgh
farther, for what he did while there, or when or why he quitted
        left in great obscurity                      but at least the Royal Society need
it,
is                                             ;
not wince, for although wit and humour cannot                                       be said       to be the
characteristic        of our Transactions, there was                               one Scotsman             who
spread the fame of Scottish humour as widely as that of the Vicar
of Wakefield— he was President of the Royal Society,                                        and his name
was Walter Scott
     There are many curious and interesting bypaths, both of science
and     literature,     traversed          in these earlier               volumes.          In    1787        Mr
George Wallace             read   a   paper, which                he      did not incline to have
printed in the Transactions, which                     I      regret, for          it   related   to   a    sub
ject the interest of which has not ceased by the lapse of nearly                                                  a
century.        Its title was " On the Causes                             of the        Disagreeableness
and Coldness          of the East Winds."                 As  I         fear there        is   little reason

466                           Proceedings               of   the    Royal Society
to   think that           the east wind                has     become          less       disagreeable            or cold
since     that date, it might have been consolatory to know to what
these attributes were due.                            At all   events          the question remains                      un
fortunately         as    prominently for determination in                                    1884 as        it    existed
in 1787.
     In   the first volume                     of the Transactions               a   very singular problem
was presented              through             Mr Adam Smith                   to the Society, along with
other learned              bodies          in Europe, by            a    Hungarian             nobleman, Count
Windischgratz,             and        a   prize was offered              by him of 1000 ducats for
the best solution of                  it,      and of 500 ducats for an approximation to                                     a
solution.           It   was    a     bold effort of philanthropy,                            for its object             was
the abolition of lawyers for the future.                                   The problem was                   addressed
to the learned of all nations.         It was couched in Latin, but                                                was       in
substance           this —:
                           " To find formula;  by which any person                                                  might
bind himself, or transfer any property to another,                                             from any           motive,
or under any conditions, the formula; to be such                                            as    should fit         even-
possible       case,      and be          as    free from doubt, and as                     little liable          to con
troversy,       as the        terms            used    in mathematics."                   I    suppose          that the
prospect       here held out of dispensing                              for the future with the                       least
popular of the learned professions,                                inclined the Society to                      entertain
it   favourably, for they proceeded to invite solutions of the                                                  problem,
and three were received                          by them.           In    1788 we find               it   recorded           in
the minutes that                Mr Commissioner Smith (for                                so the author             of   the
 Wealth        of    Nation* was designed)                      reported             the opinion of the com
mittee that none of the three dissertations amounted to                                                     a   solution,
or an approximation                       to   a   solution of that problem                      ;    but that           one
of these,           with      a   certain motto,               although neither                  a   solution or          an
approximation              to     a   solution, was            a   work         of great          merit     ;     and Mr
Fraser Tytler was instructed to inform Count Windischgratz of                                                         their
opinion.            AVhethcr this meritorious dissertation obtained the                                                  500
ducats         or    no, we         are not informed                ;     but        as   lawyers continue                   to
flourish, and legal                 terminology to produce disputes                              as   prolifically        as
ever,     it   seems clear that the author had not earned them.
     Now that we have an observatory on Ben Nevis, our                                                    successors      at
the end of next century                         will know accurately the conditions                                 of   the
climate under which the                            hundred years have                      been       spent         There
are, however, some details scattered                                    over    these,      volumes which                are
 sufficiently            interesting, although                  whether they show any                             material

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                  407
alteration on our seasons, may                 be  doubtful.      The only cheering fact
which they disclose is that the first set of returns                       do not support
the idea that the mean temperature in the olden time                       was higher than
it is now. There are two sets of returns printed in                       the first volumo
of the Transaction*, one kept at Branxholm, from                           1773    to    1783,
communicated            by the Duke of Buccleuch, who was the                    first Presi
dent of       the Society, and the              second    by Mr      Maegowan,        kept at
Hawkhill,         near Edinburgh,           from 1770 to 1776.          In   the    first, the
mean temperature              of the ten years is 44°, in the second 45° — not                 a
very genial          retrospect.       Things       must have       been    somewhat        dis
couraging         for the      farmers      in  1782, for a paper      is noticed in the
second volume of the Transactions,                      by Dr Roebuck         of Sheffield,
who was         the     manager      of the Carron Iron Works,              recommending
farmers not to cut their corn green in October, although there was
ice three quarters of an inch thick at Horrowstounucss, because corn
 would fill       at a temperature          of 43°.    Things     looked brighter from
 1794 to 1799, for which years we have results furnished by Play-
 fair.     For     the    first three      years, 1794,     1795, and      1796, the mean
 temperature was            48c ; and    that although 1795 was one of the most
 severe winters on record, the thermometer having stood frequently
 several degrees below zero, and                a  continuous frost having lasted for
 fifty-three days.           The mean temperature            in 1794, however, was 50".
 The    account of the             great    frost of 1795, which          is given in tho
  Transactions,        is well     worth referring       to.    In tho next    three      years
  the mean temperature             was 48°, that of 1798 being 49°-28°.                Of this
  year (1798)       Playfair      says that the climate of this part of the island
  hardly admits of          a  finer season.
     No    tables were furnished to the Society                 in continuation of        thoso
  of Professor        Playfair until         1830,   when fortunately        Dr Barnes of
  Carlisle    communicated to the                 Society    a  series  of meteorological
  tables kept at Carlisle for the first twenty-four years of the century.
  The results seem mainly to concur with those of Professor Playfair.
  The mean temperature                for tho twenty-four years being 47°, being
   3  degrees     higher than the average of the ten years from 1773                          to
   1783    at Branxholm,          and    2   degrees   higher than the mean temper
   ature of the years          from 1770 to 1776 at Hawkhill.                  The highest
   temperature       I   have     noted in these        returns is that of May 1807,
   when the thermometer stood at 85° at Carlisle, and the heat on
   the 5th of August            1770,    wheD     the  thermometer       at  Hawkhill       was

468                   Proceedings of tlic Royal Society
at 81°.     The two years of this century            in which the mean temper
ature was the highest were 1811 and 1822,                 in both of which years
it was 49°.
   Of   the purely scientific part of the Royal Society's               work for the
first fifteen years of its labours,        while Hutton and Black and Play-
fair and Stewart were in full vigour, it is not too much to 6ay it was
brilliant,   full of   interest,   full of    power,    and    full of enthusiasm.
The first great Founders, of course, gradually waned,                   and all such
associations   are necessarily     subjected     to alternations of the tide; but
as the tale goes on, the mathematical             papers begin to bear the names
of John Leslie and "William Wallace.                 We encounter       Walter Scott
in  1800, in 1808 the name of David Brewster,                  and in 1811 that of
Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane, whose names adorned and whose
labours were in the future the prop and stay of the Society.                        Of
Scott   I need   not speak, but of the services rendered              by Brewster it
is impossible to express myself too strongly.                He too, like Playfair,
had a mind of a rare versatility ; he could observe as well as draw
from his own resources.           He could reason       as   well  as describe.     He
could build a framework of sound               deduction     from the most unpro
mising hypothesis,       and work out with unflagging spirit the thread              of
demonstration,      however     slender.     In   some respects he differed      from
some of his contemporaries         or predecessors.       He did not for the most
part   shrink    from giving the          Society the      benefit   of his present
thoughts    and current experiments.            Sometimes      they were imperfect,
sometimes     perhaps even crude, but always           full of   acuteness, novelty,
and genius.       Had    I   had the scientific      knowledge essential       to the
task, nothing     I think    could have been more interesting than to have
traced Sir David Brewster's          first speculations     on light and heat con
tributed to the Society         to the end of his career, and to mark and
observe how great results gradually crowded                on his canvas, to    till in
the first slight and imperfect         sketch.     He was the most prolific con
tributor of his day        ;  nor do    I  think that any one but himself in
those times could have kept the fire lighted by Hutton and                   Playfair
burning    so brilliantly.      For it is not to be disguised that in the heat
 of the continental struggle         an air of languor creeps over the pro
 ceedings.     The joyous enthusiasm            of  1 783   refuses   to be invoked,
 and is solicited    in vain.     Nor is it wonderful,        when the Gauls were
 so nearly at our gates, the safety of our own commonwealth                    should
 have been comparatively         our only   care.    But when 1815 had arrived.

 and men's minds, set free from the long anxiety, had again tranquillity
  to cultivate   the arts of peace, the energy          of the rebound       was great,
 and the history of British science          has been one continued            triumph
  ever since.     By the exertions      of Brewster and Brisbane,            and many
 other Associates,     our Society     again    began     to flourish, both leading
 and following the course of discovery           as the stream flowed on.           Both
 of these men continued        to be the pride and ornament             of the Society
 long after the expiration of that half century              which    I have assigned
 to myself as my limit.         Sir Thomas Brisbane           succeeded     Sir Walter
 Scott as President in 1832,         and survived until 1860.              Long before
 that a new generation       had surrounded        the veteran philosophers,         and
 their destiny has been to recount           and carry       forward discoveries of
 which even Brewster        and   Brisbane hardly dreamt.              But the merits
 and successes of these later heroes must be the theme of some future
historian,    for at present, although posterity            may think them braver
sons of brave sires, they        and their reputation          are too close at hand
to be properly treated of.         Some names, indeed,           contemporary       with
ourselves, but too early lost,       I should      like to have mentioned           with
a   word of commemoration           ; but,   on the whole,        I have thought        it
better to adhere to my original programme.
    I mentioned      in the outset of these remarks that the Society,                  as
originally constituted,      was   divided into two classes, — the Physical
 and the Literary,     — and    that   these classes were to meet separately.
I do   not think this separation was politic               ; and  it is  impossible    to
deny that      it very  early proved      a failure.      For   some years the lite
rary side of the Society was maintained with considerable                    spirit and
vigour,    and some of the papers            printed in the Transactions will
repay porusaL        Mr Maclaurin's       paper,     to prove    that Troy was not
taken     by the Greeks, is a bold, learned, and not unsuccessful                   chal
lenge of Homer's        historical accuracy      ; and since Schlieman's          recent
explanations,      perhaps   more reason       has been shown for his doubts.
M. Chevalier contributed an elaborate               paper    on the   Plain of Troy,
in French, which attracted          attention, and obtained some reputation
on the Continent.         One of the most important contributions to this
department      of the Society's     labours is a paper by Henry Mackenzie
on the German         Stage, written at a period when German                 literature
was little known or appreciated             in this country, and composed in
the light, elegant style characteristic         of the author.       Thero is also in
the second volume         of the Transactions a scholarly and interesting

470                    Proceedings oj the Boyal Society
paper by      Dr Beattie     on the    Sixth Book of Virgil's Euclid,        read in
1787.       Altogether, however,       this class or section of the Society did
not command          the success which attended         the physical       As time
went on, there seemed to be a want of material,                   and the     papers
dwindled down to somewhat              pedantic dissertations     on grammar,       on
moods      of verbs, on pronouns,         on the Greek letter      sigma,     on  the
Greek At, on the necessity              for defining synonymous terms,            and
topics of this class, which although valued            by and probably interest
ing to      a  limited class of philologists, were not animated            in them
selves, nor likely to excite enthusiasm           on a general audience.        I was
quite prepared, accordingly, to find that the result occurred which
circumstances        foreshadowed.       The following     entries   occur    in   the
 Minutes :—
     " 1793. — There being no business for           the stated days of meeting
 in April, June, July, and November, no              meetings were then held."
     The same entry occurs            in 1794; and the Literary         class    thus
 practically perished        of inanition ten years after the foundation of
 the    Society;     and    in  1808 the    minute-book of that class cease*
 altogether.        There has been no separate Literary class 6ince the new
 rules passed in 1811.
     It  is not difficult to trace the causes which led to the continuance
 of this.       In  1783 there had been a wave of literary revival passing
 over     Scotland ever since the middle of the century, and our prose
  writers,    Hume, Kobertson, Blair, and others of that circle, including
 specially Henry Mackenzie,             had raised a spirit of enthusiasm for
 such     pursuits.     But such fashions       rapidly change.     The immense
  eilects    produced     on human thought by the French Revolution gave
  a fresh impulse and a new direction to literary taste.              New outlets,
  more profitable      than the supply of our Tranmriions, soon afterwards
  opened      to   the   literary   world      The   Edinburgh     and   Quarterly
  Reviews; Byron, Scott,           "Wordsworth,    Coleridge,   and Campbell        in
  augurated       a new era, under which the old ways became unfashion
  able,    and the old taste obsolete.          Matters Btood quite differently
  with the Thysical class.            In that opinions may grow obsolete, bus
  the theme never.           Fresh   ground is always to be found. So men
  turned out with alacrity to hear about the Vulcanists and Neptunisks
  or latent heat or the latest geometrical         problem,   who would not stir
  from their homes to be told the use of a subjunctive, or Dr Parr**
                                 "
  derivation of the word sublimit."

                        of Edinburgh,        Session 1883-84.                       471
    In  its former shape it would be impossible             to revive the Literary
 class.    Still  I think    it would lighten and enliven our          meetings here
if   the graver      matters    of the physical class were sometimes              inter
spersed with contributions            of a literary nature.      This    I  see plainly
cannot     be done without         some labour,    and some concert among the
Fellows.       If I  can aid in any such scheme,          I need   not say that any
assistance    I  can give would be willingly         rendered.
    Before quitting this subject of the Literary class,             I would     remark
that the most valuable papers of this class are the Obituary Notices,
which in general are good examples of vigorous and elegant writing,
and are interesting as authentic          records of celebrated men.          The three
notices    by Dugald Stewart of Adam Smith, Principal                       Eobertson,
and Thomas Reid are printed in Stowart's                Life  by  Sir W. Hamilton,
and are masterpieces of biography.              Two others in particular arrested
my attention.         The first,    a very remarkable       paper by the Rov.        Mr
Alison     on    Lord     Woodhouselee,       and   the   other,  a  charming       bio
graphy     of Lord Abercromby by Henry Mackenzie.
    One class of our Founders          I feel I have  treated with scant justice —
I mean     those of the legal profession.          The truth is they furnished a
large and available         contingent,    more perhaps     in the way of influence
than    in that of contribution.            But  I have not done so from under
valuing the aid they gave, but because to estimate properly their
assistance      would have led me into inquiries which would have
swelled     this paper — already,       I  fear, too prolix   — beyond       reasonable
dimensions.         It" would have involved a dissertation on the Mirror
and the Lounger, and the state of periodical literature                    in Scotland
at the     close of     last  century.      The men whom Henry Mackenzie
gathered     round him were almost all lawyers, and lawyers of note —
Lord Abercromby, Lord Craig,                 Lord   Dreghorn, and Lord Banna-
tyne were men well deserving                of commemoration.         It   i3 true, our
 Transactions contain few contributions from their pen                 ;   but the true
value     of such institutions       as the   Royal Society is found mainly not
in the contributions to the evening's interest, but in the enthusiasm
 they foster     and the inquiries they excite.            One man who indicates
 earnestness in the prosecution           of a science or an experiment, may do
 more to encourage the spirit and love of investigation than the more
 constant     contributor.       It  is the social    tribunal in which, after all,
 such institutions        as ours   must depend; and to excite general atten
 tion, and stimulate         rivalry, and inspire the generous emulation              to

472                  Proceedings of the Royal Society
walk in the footsteps         of our predecessors,      and   to keep      the torch
which they have handed           down to us burning brightly, is to show
ourselves   worthy of our great inheritance.
   I  cannot   finish my remarks        without    a  tribute of respect to the
able and vigorous intellect of the man        I just  now mentioned       —I    mean
Henry Mackenzie.           The Society owes him many              obligations    ; so
does his country.         Ho created     a style    of periodical literature in
Scotland which has borne rich fruit            ; and    although even he could
not prolong the life of the literary class, his own extended                     to a
patriarchal   age,  in which he saw the lessons he had taught                produce
an exuberant     harvest.     As a pendant    to some of Cockburn's sketches
of the olden    time,  I   finish these desultory       outlines   by   a  quotation
from another writer.         The author of Peter's        Letters —   I   suppose   I
may say John Gibson Lockhart — describes                  a  dinner party about
 1818,  at the house of Henry Mackenzie, at which                  the only other
guest was another      of our founders Adam Rolland, who, if he only
lived on Raeburn's canvas, could not have been forgotten.
   Ho says — " The only visitor besides myself was an old friend, and
indeed contemporary        with Mackenzie,       a Mr Roland,     who was in his
time at the head of the legal profession in Scotland, but who has now
lived for several years in retirement.          I have   never seen a finer speci
men, both in appearance and manner, of the old Scottish gentleman.
   " It  was a delightful thing to see these two old men, who rendered
themselves    eminent     in two   so different    walks of exertion,        meeting
together in the quiet evening        of their days, to enjoy in the company
of each other every luxury which intellectual communication can
afford, heightened     by the yet richer luxury of talking over the feel
ings of times to which they almost alone are not strangers."
                                                                              " They
are both perfectly      men of the world, and          there   was not the least
tinge of professional     pedantry   in their conversation."       He proceeds     —
" According     to the picture    they gave, the style of social intercourse
in this city, in their younger days, seems indeed to have been wonder
fully  easy  and captivating.       At  that time not one stone of the New
Town, in which they and all the fashionable                inhabitants of Edin
burgh now reside, had been erected.                The whole      of the genteel
population lived crowded          together in those tall citadels of the Old
Town.      Their houses were small, but abundantly             neat and comfort
able, and the labour which it cost to ascend to ono of them was sure
to be repaid by a hearty welcome           from its possessor.       The style of

                       of Edinburgh,        Session      1883-84.                        473
visiting altogether was        as different      as possible      from the ceremonious
sort of fashion      now in vogue."           He concludes           his description by
SRying,
         "  If I  were to take        the   evening      I   spent     in listening to its
history   as a   fair specimen of the          '
                                                  Auld Time,'        I should     be almost
inclined to reverse the words of the Laureate,                   and   say —
                     Of all places, and all times of earth,                                  4
             Did fate grant choice of time and place to men,                              .
             Wise choice might he their 'Scotland,' and their ' Then.'"
   Enough for the present, this retrospect, and the slender                        tribute   I
have attempted        to pay to the memory             and labours       of a masculine
and powerful generation.             That we have built on their discoveries,
and have learned even by their errors, is quite true ; for the history
of the second       half of the century exhibits science far in advance of
1783,   and even of 1833.              In   1783      geology       was   in its infancy.
Palaeontology      was all but unknown.                Cuvier was only then com
mencing his pursuits in comparative                 anatomy,      which were to end in
reproducing the forms of extinct life.                   The glacial       epoch    had not
then been      elucidated     by the research           and    genius     of Forbes      and
Agassiz,   and the dynamic theory                of heat was still unproclaimed.
The wonders of the photographic               art were unknown, even in 1833,
for Talbot      and    Daguerre      did not       come on the scene for several
years afterwards.         In   1833    the apostle       and disciples        of evolution
had not then broken ground               on that vast field            of inquiry.       The
ever-increasing      development        of the mysteries of light and sound,
spectrum analysis, and the marvellous                  results     which it    haR already
furnished,     and    those   which it promises,            have      in   our day only
heralded the advent of a new science.                  But, however far in advance
of the Founders of the Royal              Society the current philosophy may
be, there was a robustness         and characteristic         individuality about the
great men    of that generation        which we may not hope to              see replaced.
   We may assume, indeed                we hope,       that the close of the next
century   will find    the progress of knowledge as far advanced                    beyond
its present    limits   as we   think that the science of to-day is beyond
the point reached a century ago.                 "We   may be assured          that before
that time     arrives, many surmises, still in the region of hypothesis,
will have become certainties,            and that many             supposed      certainties
will   have     turned out       fallacies.        Many     errors      will    have    been
 corrected,   many      dogmas     discredited,       many      theories     confirmed      or
 refuted at the bar of ascertained           fact, as     those of 1783 have been.

Yet even then will our successors,          I  trust,  as   we now do,      stand
reverently before the memory of our Founders.               In their very linea
ments, of which, as portrayed        by the master hand of Raeburn, we
saw many not far from this spot a few years ago, the vigour and
originality of the men are written in characters not to be mistaken.
Happy is the institution        which can show such a muster-roll, and
happy the country which can boast such sons.                I take leave of my
theme with the fervent hope and firm conviction that, in the century
which we now inaugurate,        the Royal Society      will continue with like
success the noble task to which by its Charter            it is devoted,   of in
vestigating   the hidden treasures of nature, and appropriating them
to the benefit and happiness       of mankind.

2.    On the Microscopic Characters              of   Volcanic     Ashes     and
        Cosmic    Dust, and their Distribution in the Deep Sea
        Deposits.      By Mr John Murray and Mons. A. EenartL
        Communicated        by   Mr John Murray.
    In the Session    of 1876, Mr John Murray communicated                to this
Society    a  paper   on   the distribution     of volcanic debris over the
floor of the ocean,* and in it announced             the discovery     of cosmic
dust in deep sea deposits.          It was    shown that at points,        where
neither    the action   of waves, rivers,    or currents     can transport     the
debris of continents,     volcanic materials play the most important role
in the formation of the mineral constituents          of the deep   sea deposits.
 It  was pointed out that pumice,        on account      of its structure,    was
able to float to great distances,     but in time became waterlogged          and
 sank to the bottom,     there to decompose.        On the other hand, inco
 herent   volcanic matters,    ejected  in the form of lapilli, sand, and
ashes, into the higher regions of the atmosphere,         may, ceteris paribus,
 be conveyed,    in consequence of their small dimensions             and struc
 ture, to greater distances    tlian other mineral      particles  derived from
 the continents.     The possibility was also admitted          that  submarine
 volcanic eruptions might also contribute to the accumulation of

presently     point out
    During the past few years we have added greatly to the observa
tions which were the subject of Mr Murray's communication.                            The
present paper         has been suggested          by the striking analogy          which
exists between the volcanic products                we have found in all deep sea
sediments       and the ashes and incoherent products                of a recent cele
brated    eruption, — that of Krakatoa.              The remarkable meteorological
phenomena         we have       recently witnessed         have  been attributed by
some    to the presence in the atmosphere              of mineral particles derived
from     this     volcanic eruption, and by others               to   that of cosmic
dust.      It   is said    that in several        places in America, and even in
Europe,     matters     have been collected         which must bo regarded         as the
ashes    from Krakatoa, which have been suspended for several months
in the upper currents            of the atmosphere.          The importance       of this
matter has been recognised             by the Eoyal Society of London, which
 has appointed          a   committee     of     its members      to   collect    all  the
 documents        and observations        relative to the distribution of these
 ashes.     The present state of the question induces us to make known
 some results of the detailed            researches     which we have undertaken
 upon similar subjects.           We   desire to make known to those who wish
 to study atmospheric           dust, the distinctive microscopic          characters by
 the aid of which we have               been able to establish         the volcanic or
 cosmic nature of certain particles             found in deep    sea deposits,     and to
 show at the same time            the enormous         area of the ocean over which
 we have been able to detect            their distribution.
     We believe that no better example could be found in support of
  our interpretations than the microscopic                 study of the ashes from
  Krakatoa, whose mineralogical            and chemical composition          M. Eenard *
  was the    first to make known, and whose observations                 on this subject
  have been amply confirmed              by the later researches of other minera
  logists.     On the other        hand,    the conditions under         which floating
  pumice was found after that eruption agree perfectly with the inter
   pretation given eight years ago by             Mr Murray, relative        to the mode
  of transport      of these vitreous matters, and of the accumulation                   of
  their   triturated debris on the bottom of the ocean.                   We shall also

 see  how the sorting which takes place in the transport of the ashes
of a volcano has its analogy in what we find in the deep sea deposits.
    In the First Part of this communication we shall give the miner-
alogical     description of the fragmentary            products    of Krakatoa, and
consider      generally the       observations     relative to these ashes.          We
shall also give the diagnostic          characters of this volcanic dust, and of
all similar particles which           we find in. deep sea deposits.            In   the
 Second     Part, we will treat of the           cosmic     matters    found    in   the
abysmal regions of the ocean, to which                Mr Murray      was the first to
draw attention, and discuss their origin and distribution.
                                      Fibst Part.
    It  is unnecessary      to refer  to the abundance       of floating pumice, to
its various     degrees      of alteration,    to its conveyance        by means of
rivers, waves, and currents, and to its universal presence in deep                   sea
deposits, which have been pointed             out in some detail      in Mr Murray's
paper     above    referred    to ; but we    will briefly   recapitulate    the char
acters of these volcanic matters, in accordance               with the examination
we have made of a large number of soundings                   and dredgings.        We
need not describe in detail the special characters of the lapilli which
have     been brought up in the dredge              and sounding-rod from great
depths.       These fragments       of more or less scoriaceous         rocks   belong
to the 6ame       lithological varieties      as  those derived from terrestrial
volcanoes.       They consist of fragments of trachyte of various dimen
sions, of basalt, and, above all, of augite-andesite             ; the most   remark
able,    beyond     all question, being lapilli of sideromelan,             which are
often    entirely transformed        into palagonite,      and   pass into the clay
which is found        so  widely distributed, especially        in the Pacific.
    We do not propose here to take up in detail the wide distribution
of the materials ejected from Krakatoa               ; we are engaged      in collect
ing these, and will place the observations                   on   maps    along    with
those of     Mr Buchan       on the upper currents       of the atmosphere,      which
will   be published in the
                                  " Challenger" Reports.
    Before, however,       passing to the description of the ashes themselves
wo   will briefly    refer to some points touched          upon    by Mr Murray in
his paper.       It is  there pointed out that, in regions far removed            from
coasts, rounded        fragments    of pumice were collected         on the surface
of the     sea by means       of the tow-net, and that, at certain          points on
the bottom      of the ocean, the greater part of the deposit is compssd

 of vitreous splinters         derived    from the trituration of pumice stones.
 The description          of the phenomena          connected      with the Krakatoa
 eruption gives us a            complete     explanation of these observations.
 The specimens of pumice             from Krakatoa, which have been collected
 floating    on the sea and which wo have examined,                 are in like manner
rounded.         The angular surfaces            are   all worn away         just    as   in
pebbles ; the        only asperities      to be observed       consist of crystals      and
fragments       of crystals,     which project beyond the general              surface of
the vitreous       matter, which last, on account of its structure,               presents
less    resistance      to   wear    and    tear   than the       minerals    which      are
embedded         in it.
    We may recall          the fact that the Bay of Lampoung, in the Straits
of Sunda,        was blocked by the vast accumulation                of pumice, formed
in a few hours by the eruption               of Krakatoa, which completely            filled
the bay.         This floating bar of pumice stones was about 30 kilometres
long,     1  kilometre broad, and         3 to 4 metres     in depth,   2 or 3 metres      of
which        were    below    the surface     of the water, and         1   metre above.
These       numbers      give   about    150 millions of cubic metres of ejected
matter.        This moving       elastic wall rose and fell with          the waves and
tide,* and was carried by currents thousands                   of miles from the point
of eruption         over the surface of the ocean.               The rounded form of
blocks of pumice            met with      everywhere      floating on the surface of
the sea, as       well  as of those samples       which, after having floated some
time, became waterlogged               and sank to the bottom, may be perfectly
explained       if  we remember the friability of this rock, and, at the same
time, the       agitation to which it is submitted by the waves, through
which the pieces           are continually being        knocked against each other.
We understand           also how this wear and tear gives rise to an immense
quantity of pulverulent pumice fragments,                  which contribute      in a great
measure       to the formation of oceanic deposits.               As  a matter of fact,
rounded fragments            of pumice      have been       met with     floating on the
surface of every ocean, and during the last few years many samples
have been sent to us            by captains of ships and missionaries.              As   has
been already         pointed    out, they are universally distributed in oceanic
deposits, although frequently highly altered.
    If   it be easy to pronounce upon the volcanic                nature of these larger
fragments,        it  becomes, on the other hand, exceedingly              difficult when
we have          to deal with        particles    reduced     to   powder,     and    when

recourse must be had to the microscope.                  Let   us see what are the
microscopic characters       by which we recognise            the particles of this
dust.
    We    may here     point out that it is not so much the presence                    of
volcanic minerals which enables us in             a marine sediment,         as well as
in   an atmospheric dust      like the  ashes of Krakatoa,          to recognise     that
the small fragments         have   an  eruptive origin,         as the microscopic
structure of the small vitreous particles.                It is well known           that
minerals reduced to small dimensions and irregularly fractured,                         as
in the case of volcanic ashes, often lose their distinctive                 characters.
Their    size does not allow us to judge             of their optical properties          ;
their form,      irregular and fragmentary, renders              it difficult    to   de
termine the characteristic extinction of the species               ;  the phenomena
of coloration, of pleochroism, and the tint peculiar to the mineral,
all lose so much of their intensity, that they no longer serve for                    the
identification     of isolated minerals like those of the volcanic                 ashes
which we have to study.          As a result of our observations,           we believe
that in most cases where          a  mineral, under the conditions we               have
just described, reaches dimensions less than 0 05 mm., its deter
mination with certainty is no longer possible, and consequently its
origin can no longer be established         ;  whilst   a  vitreous fragment, like
those of volcanic ashes or triturated             pumice,     continues to be         dis
cernible when its dimensions are loss than 0-005 mm.                          A  reason
for showing that the absence or rarity of crystals, or of fragments
of volcanic      crystals, ought     not to be taken            as   a   proof that       a
sedimentary matter, either from the atmosphere                   or from the        deep
sea, is   not of volcanic origin, is the sorting process to which                  these
matters     are subjected   in the air   and    in  the water, a phenomenon             to
which we shall presently recur.
     The most     reliable distinctive    character is always found in                the
 structure of the small vitreous particles which are derived from                     the
 trituration of pumice or have an analogous              origin, inasmuch       as they
 have been ejected from the volcano           in the    state of ash.       The struc
 ture peculiar to these materials is seen in their fracture, which                leaves
 its impress upon the smallest fragments of debris,                     in which      the
 microscope     can decipher no characteristic properties except such                   as
 have   relation to form.        In order      to   assure   ourselves that        these
 characters    of pumice remain constant to the extreme                 limits of pul
 verisation, such     as are employed      in   the preparation of silicates fur

chemical analysis,         we pounded       in an agate mortar        several varieties
of pumice, and the powder thus produced                    clearly    showed itself to
he composed          of particles in which          were recognisable,       with little
trouble, the characters of the pumice-like material              which    ia constantly
met    with in the sediments, and of which the ashes of Rrakatoa give
us    beautiful examplea            The diagnostic     character    to which we here
make allusion rests on the distinctive                 peculiarities of incoherent
vulcanic      products.        What       distinguishes them       from lavas is not
merely the         extraordinary abundance           of vitreous     matters, but also
the    prodigious number of gas-bubbles               which are enclosed          by the
pumice       and vitreous volcanic             sands  and    ashes.     These    bubbles
are     due    to the expansion          of the gases dissolved        in the     magma,
which also determine the eruption.                If we  admit, as everything seems
to show,      that these incoherent          volcanic matters are the products of
the pulverisation           of a fluid magma, we can understand               that these
particles,     on cooling rapidly, will        remain in the vitreous state, and, on
 the other      hand, that the dissolved gases, yielding to the expansion,
 will form numerous           pores which      will become elongated       owing to the
 mode of projection.            It  is the existence of these bubbles,         or of such
 a filamentous        structure,    which points out to us the vitreous          volcanic
 materials      in   spite of the great fineness of subdivision.               It   is also
 this structure which allows these               bodies to be carried to such great
 distances from the scene of eruption.
      The examination of the Krakatoa ashes, and of the dust resulting
  from     the    pulverisation       of the     pumice   of   that volcano,         shows
  markedly       the peculiarity due to the bullous              structure.        If   this
  grey-green pulverulent matter be placed                under the microscope it is
  seen    to be     composed       of almost     impalpable grains,       with a mean
  diameter      of 0-l mm., which are almost               exclusively colourless          or
  brownish       vitreous particles permeated           by bubbles.        The bubbles
  are   rarely globular, but often elongated,             as   we have just pointed
  out, and they give          a drawn-out appearance          to the fragments.           As
  often happens,         several bubbles are elongated         parallel to each other,
   and in this case,        the pore becomes a simple streak ; the fragment
  then assumes a fibrous texture,              which may cause it to resemble at
   fust sight     a striated     felspar    or an organic     remnant ; but an exa
   mination     of the outline       will  never allow of this confusion.             If  wo
   examine the terminal contours and lines of these bubble-containing
    fragments,     we     never    find that they are straight lines,            but     that

This mode of fracture is             in correspondence        with the     vacuolated
structure, and, just       as  in the porous       pumice,    the vitreous     volcanic
ashes are permeated          by vacuoles    ; besides,   everything goes to show
that the fragmentary          condition and the fresh fractures          are due to a
tension phenomenon          which affects these vitreous matters in a manner
analogous      to what is observed      in  the  " Kupert's drops."
   Fio.  1. — Vitreous particles of the Ashes   of Krakatoa, which fell at Batavia,
                                27th August 1883    (jh).
     We have pointed out that brown vitreous fragments are rare in
 the    ashes     of Krakatoa.        These,   however,      contain skeletons         of
 magnetic      iron, and are devitrified by microliths.*               It  is scarcely
 necessary to add that the particles,           whose form we have indicated,
 are isotropic.       If  under crossed nicols wo sometimes             see  the   field
 illuminated, this is duo to crystals            in the vitreous matter,         or to
 phenomena        of tension, which are sometimea observed in the neigh
 bourhood of the bubbles.
     These details      on the microstructure of the vitreous          particles  from
 Krakatoa can be applied with most perfect exactitude                     to the vol
 canic    dusts,    which we have determined           as   such, in the     deep sea
 deposits.       In  virtue of their bulbous structure, their dimensions,           and
 their mode of projection, they are capable of being widely transported
 from the point of eruption         by aerial currents.       It must be admitted,
    *
      Just as we can divide pumice microscopically according as it is acid or
 basic, so the products of its trituration may be recognised under the micrOKope,
 inasmuch     as the former often give colourless     and more elongated particles
 while the fragments of basic pumice have a more pronounced tint and morr
 rounded    pores.

however, that in the deep sea sediments              a very large part of these
vitreous splinters    has not been derived         from the pulverised ejections
from a volcano, but from the trituration of floating pumice, of which
we have given above a         striking example.        It will be    understood    that
it is scarcely possible to trace the difference between               volcanic   ashes,
properly so called, and the products           resulting from the pulverisation
of floating pumice which we have just indicated.                    As in     the inco
herent products      of Krakatoa,     so we   find spread out on the bottom of
the sea many more vitreous           particles,   similar to those we have just
described, than of true volcanic minerals.               This is easily explained,
however, when we remember              how the distribution        of volcanic dust
takes   placa
   Let us now point out the minerals which can be determined                       with
certainty in the ashes of this great            eruption    ; and we     may at once
remark that they are the same which we have almost always found
associated in the deposits with            the splinters of glass.          In  general
all the crystals are fractured,        except those     which are still embedded
in a vitreous layer ; this          vitreous    coating    is often     crackled    and
bullous.     In   the ashes of Krakatoa, however,            we have not remarked
the globules of glass which             are often     described     as  glued    to the
 minerals   of volcanic     ashes, nor have we seen the drawn-out vitreous
filaments    resembling Peles hair.             The minerals       of the     Krakatoa
 ashes   which are susceptible         of a rigorous      determination       belong to
 plagioclttse, augite,     rhombic pyroxene,        and magnetite.*           We shall
 presently    see   the    peculiarity    which     distinguishes each of these
 species  in the ashes.
    Among the most frequent minerals,                 but poorly represented          in
 comparison     with the vitreous matter, plagioclase            felspar comes first.
 This mineral has about          the same dimensions          as the    vitreous   fra"-
                                                                                      o
 luents, and, with the exception           of the crystals      entirely enclosed in
 the pumice     matter, is in the form of ddbris.          Sometimes twins on the
 albite plan can be distinguished, and the              results of analysis      clearly
 indicate that it is triclinic felspar        which should almost exclusively
 be   found in this ash.       But the most interesting crystals of plagio-
    *
       Lately the works on these same ashes have made known as accidental
 elements pyrites,   apatite, and perhaps biotite (?).     It is to be remarked, how
 ever, that these minerals must be extremely            rare in comparison with the
 vitreous matters and mineral species above-mentioned.

clase, and the most characteristic of this ash, although represented
very rarely, are in the form of rhombic tables, extremely thin, and
covered with a fine lacework of vitreous matter.      We know that
the crystals   described  by Penck * in a great number of                                          lapilli
and of volcanic ashes, upon the nature of which doubts have                                         been
expressed,        belong incontestibly to the plagioclases,                         and represent      aa
isomorphic mixture analagous to that of bytownite. It is to Mr
Max Schuster f that we owe this specific determination.  Having
found in numerous sediments of the Pacific these same crystals in
the form of rhombic tables, and possessing preparations                                   which   would
be of great interest to him in his remarkable                              optical studies        on the
felspars, we submitted them to this ingenious mineralogist in order to
confirm our determination.                    "We believe          it will be interesting         to give
a resume          here of the results              of the observations              of Mr    Schuster,
which are perfectly applicable to the characteristic crystals of felspar
from Krakatoa, as well as to those which we have discovered in a
great number of deep sea soundings.
      This plagioclase        occurs for the most                  part in flat tabular crystals
with the clinopinakoid                 especially          developed.           Individuals       of the
columnar type, elongated in the direction of the edge P/M, are rare.
These tabular crystals consist essentially of a combination of the
clinopinakoid          with   P       and x, more rarely                with P, u, and y,            and
occasionally        x and y appear together.                      In   the first case the crystals
have     the form of a rhomb,                 in    the second case they are elongated
through the predominance                    of either x or P.                  The dimensions           of
those crystals         which were examined                  and measured, lie between the
line 0-61 mm. broad and                 1   mm long          as    maximum,          and 0 015 mm.
broad      and     0O42 mm. long               as    minimum.            The extinction of            the
plagioclase        is negative.         Its    value       was found to vary between                  22'
and 32° on             the clinopinakoid,            and     between           8°   and   16° on the
basal plane.           The average values of many measurements                               made on
good     crystals      are as follows:         — 24°       12', 25°      6',   and 29° 6' on the
clinopinakoid,          10° 42' on the one side, and 10° 18' on the other
side of the twinning              line,       as    this    is   shown     on       the basal     plane.

  Polysynthetic individuals, made up of repeated twins on the albitc
 plan,   were     very rarely observed.          The felspar     in its optical pro
 perties   is   thus    seen   to    lie between     labradorite and        bytownite.
 The twin        growths are particularly frequent and interesting on
 account     of the structure        of the individuals.       In addition       to those
 of the albite type, others were observed               in which the edges P/M
 and   P/K     could be definitely determined           as the axes of twinning,
 whilst   P   and  K   formed the twinning planes.          The plane of composi
 tion was principally either            P  or M   when penetration         twins were
 not observed.
    These fragments         and crystals of plagioclasc       contain    inclusions of
 vitreous matter,        and   sometimes      grains of magnetite.          Perhaps       a
 small number of felspathic grains may belong                      to sanidine,        the
 presence     of which is insinuated by the percentage                of potass indi
cated by the analysis         which follow (K20 = 0'97 per cent.).
    ~We  have said that the pyroxenic minerals of the ash are augite and
a  rhombic pyroxene          ; we    distinguish them by the microscope some
times   in   the form of fragments        — and this is usually     the case     — some
times    in    the   form of crystals,        which wo     can isolate        from the
volcanic glass covering them by treating them with                        hydrofluoric
acid.     In    the   crystals     of augite    we distinguish      the    faces    of a
prism, of the brachypinakoid, and indications                    of the      faces of a
pyramid.        This augite is pleochroic and has a greenish                   tint, and
extinguishes in certain           cases obliquely to the prismatic edges.                It
is this character        which often permits it to be distinguished from
rhombic       pyroxene with           which   the   augite   is associated.          The
crystals of hypersthene             are transparent,    of a deep brown colour,
strongly dichroic, with green and brown tints.                    They are in rect
angular prisms terminated               by a pyramid, and extinguish between
crossed     nicols parallel to their longitudinal edges.             Magnetic iron,
which is rather abundant in the ashes, is recognised in the form of
grains and octahedrons.               We   have   not been able to detect with
certainty either hornblende or olivine.                The largest grains of this
ash are true microscopic          lapilli, where we distinguish        in a vitreous
mass    microlithic crystals         of felspar, of magnetite, and more rarely
of pyroxene.         Finally,   we observe with the microscope             particles    of
an organic origin, which are easily recognisable              by their fibrous and
reticulated structure.         These     impurities may have been transported

    In  spite   of all the uncertainties which the exact              diagnoses of
volcanic dus* present, we can consider              them often, from the point
of view of their mineralogical composition,                as analogous with the
 augitc-andesites.      We know,      besides, that   it  is to these rocks that
 the lavas of the volcano of Krakatoa should be referred.

the    distribution of the       substances     among       the different species of
constituent minerals.         This vitreous matter           can indeed contain an
indeterminate quantity of the different bases.                   On the other hand,
the difficulties     of the calculation are all the greater, as the consti
tuent    minerals of the ashes may contain, as isomorphs, the bases
which the analysis suggests.              It  is none       the less true,     however,
that the percentage        composition expressed by the analysis supports
the   preceding mineralogical determinations, without                    permitting the
species to be precisely determined.               It  agrees     with   the  interpreta
tion that tbe magma from which               the    ashes were formed belongs to
the   augite-andesites.
    The vitreous and mineral fragments we have just described from
the   Krakatoa eruption being identical with             those which we encounter
in deep sea sediments,         we may conclude that both have                  a similar
origin.      In   certain cases, however, we have in place of augitu                    a
 predominance       of hornblende, and sometimes black mica is abundant.
 Again, we find more or less fragmentary crystals of pcridote, of magne
 tite, of sanidine, and, more rarely, of leucite and of hauyne.                  We  can
 easily understand this variation in composition,                 following the nature
 of the magma from which the ashes collected                   in different regions of
 the sea   were derived.       But in all     cases    it   is the    predominance of
 vitreous particles,     with their special structure, which indicates              most
 clearly tbe volcanic nature of the inorganic constituents of a sediment.
     If now we consider the conditions which govern tbe distribution
 of ashes     in  the atmosphere or at the bottom                of the sea, we shall
 be able    to show how it is that there         is generally a predominance of
  vitreous particles in these ashes.        In the first     place, these are vitreous
  matters rather than minerals, properly so called, from the moment
  of ejection from the crater.         Moreover, wo should, in           a general way,
 not expect to find that incoherent eruptive matters, which are spread
 out at a distance from          the volcano, present           a   perfectly identical
  composition      with those other loose products such as lapilli, volcanic
 bombs, and scoria;, which          are projected only a short distance from
 the focus      of eruption.      Even where       there exists a perfect chemical
  and mineralogical       identity,   in the   crater     itself, between the lavas
  and the pulverulent       materials of tbe same eruption (the supposition
  being   that   the ashes arise simply from the trituration of the lavas),
  we can    easily understand that these latter, being carried far and wido

 486                    Procccdinys        of  the  Royal Society
  by the winds, must undergo             a  true sorting in their passage through
  tho atmosphere,      according to the specific            gravity of the amorphous
  elements     or crystalline      constituents.          It  results from    this, that
  according to the        points where         they are      collected, volcanic      ashes
  may, although belonging to tho same eruption, present differences
  not only    with  respect to the size of the grains, but also             with    respect
  to the minerals.
     In this     method     of transport          it is evident that the          vitreous
 particles, other things being equal,                   will  be transported      farthest
 from tho       centre.     In    the     first   place    they are    more    abundant
 than the other particles, and again they possess in their chemical
 nature and in their structure, conditions which permit the aerial
 currents to take them up and carry them to great distances                         ; they
 consist    of    a silicate    in which the            heavy bases     are   poorly     re
 presented      as   compared       with      tho      other   constituent    elements       ;
 they are filled with gaseous bubbles which                       lower their specific
gravity, and at the same time are capable of being broken up into
 the minutest       particles.     The minerals with which they                 are   asso
ciated at the moment of ejection from the crater aro not, like them,
filled with gaseous bubbles            ;   they do not break up so easily into
impalpable powder, for they are not porous, and are not in the                        same
state of tension as the rapidly-cooled vitreous dust.                   Finally,     many
of these species are precisely those whoso                    specific gravity is very
high, on account of the bases entering into their composition.                       Those
minerals will not then be carried              so  far from tho centre of eruption,
and    in all   cases   the vitreous particles are the essential            ones    in  the
atmospheric      dusts derived from volcanic ashes.
    Wo have a beautiful illustration of this in the ashes of Krakatoa.
In proportion      as tho ashes are collected           at a greater distance      from    a
volcano, so are they less rich        in minerals,       and the quantity    of  vitreous
matter predominates.           According to a verbal communication from
Professor Judd, tho ashes collected at Japan contain only a relatively
small proportion of pyroxene and magnetite.
    If  wo wish to assure ourselves              of   the nature of an atmospheric
dust,    and,   as has lately been frequently attempted                 in Europe,       to
show that the dust is really from                    the Krakatoa       eruption, it      is
important above all to seek for the presence of vitreous fragments.
The characters which we have indicated permit any one to recognise

 them easily under the microscope.                    We would      remark,    however,
 that the presence         of crystals, either of byperethene,         of augite, or of
 particles    of   magnetite      iu  an atmospheric dust collected         in Europe,
 does   not prove in          a  certain manner that the dust belongs             to the
ashes    from Krakatoa; for besides the difficulties of an exact minera
logies! determination            of the fragmentary elements, it is difficult to
understand        how these heavy minerals should have been carried by
the   aerial currents, while the vitreous dust is absent.                  As   we have
just shown,        it is the contrary which should have taken place.
    It results     as a corollary from these considerations that the chemical
composition        of an ash may vary according to the point at which it
has been        collected, and it tends also, other things being equal, to
become       more acid the further             it is removed     from the centre       of
eruption.        If   wo admit, for example,           that the magma       which gave
birth to the ashes of Krakatoa is an augite-andesite,                   as  everything
 seems to     indicate, the percentage of silica (G5 por cent.) which our
analysis shows appears too high, but if we remember, what we have
just said,      that the ashes become              deprived, during     their    passage
 through the atmosphere,              of   the heavier and      more   basic elements,
 it  will   be    understood that the vitreous and felspathic                 materials,
 which      have a lower specific            gravity, and are, at the same time,
 more acid,      will accumulate         at points farthest from the volcano.          It
 will be sufficient to have directed the attention to this fact to show
 how the percentage           of silica in the ashes from the same eruption
 may vary       according     as  they are collected at     a variable distance from
  the crater.
    The predominance of vitreous .splinters in deep sea sediments                     far
  removed    from coasts is even more pronounced than in volcanic ashes
 collected    on land.       This    arises,   as wo indicated at the commence
 ment,    from the large quantity of pumice carried or projected into
  the  ocean, whoso          trituration,     which takes place      so  easily, gives
 origin    to vitreous        fragments difficult       to  distinguish    from those
 projected      from     a  volcano in the form of impalpable                dust.    In
 addition, we may state that             in  the distribution   of volcanic materials
 °n   the bottom of tho sea,              the ashes are subjected to        a mode     of
 sorting     having     some      analogy to that        which takes     place   during
 transport      through tho atmosphere.              When     these   ashes fall    into
 the sea a     separation takes place in tho water; the heaviest particles

488                   Proceedings         of  the   Royal Society
reach   the bottom       first, and        then the lighter          and smaller          ones,
di'scending more slowly, are deposited upon the larger and heavier
fragments and crystals from the same eruption.                          "We have a fine
example    of this stratification of submarine tufa in the centre of the
South Pacific, lat. 22° 21' S., long. 150° 17' W.                     This specimen            is
entirely covered with peroxide of manganese, and at the base of the
fragment we      see   the large crystals of hornblende and particles of
magnetite.      This lower layer          is covered by a deposit         in which       these
minerals and coarser grains are observed                     to pass gradually into             a
layer composed        of small crystals of felspar, debris of pumice, and
more or less fine material.
    We do not        propose      to occupy ourselves            here   with     the    mode
of   formation      of volcanic         ashes,     and with        those    of    Krakatoa
in particular.       It will      suffice    to   indicate    that in the dust of             a
volcano we        find   all     the characters         supporting       the    interpreta
tion which      regards      volcanic       ashes    as  formed       by the pulverisa
tion   of an     igneous      fluid     mass     in which       float   crystals already
formed,   and    from which, when projected by                    gases,  the pulverised
vitreous particles undergo           a  rapid cooling and decrepitation during
their passage through the atmosphere.                     It   is not only the micro
scopic examination        of    these volcanic matters            that leads us to this
conclusion, but the prodigious quantity of ashes formed during                             the
eruption of this volcano, which do not agree with the interpretation
that regards     these ashes as the result of a pulverisation                    of   a rock
already solidified in the crater.             Indeed one cannot understand               how,
in two or three days, the immense                   quantity of ashes ejected            from
 Krakatoa could be formed by this process, as, for instance,                          on the
 26th August 1883 and in the May eruption, which was the prelude
 to that catastrophe.

    The    recent     brilliant      sunsets       have    been      attributed       to   the

 to  conclude this brief abstract of our observations by a                           descrip

 volcanic ashes and pumice,               in   those regions of        the deep       sea far
 from land, where the sediment accumulates                      with extreme       slowness.

  In    another     memoir    *   we    have     pointed out        the    distribution      of
 these particles      on the floor of the ocean, and indicated the conclu
 sions which we believe are justified                by their relative abundance            in
 the red clay areas of the Central Pacific.
     It  is known that the atmosphere holds in suspension an immense
 number of microscopic particles which are of organic and inorganic
 origin, and are either dust taken up by aerial currents from the ground
 or are extra-terrestrial       bodies.      A    large    number      of scientific men,
headed       by Ehrenberg, Daubree,             Keichenbach, Xordenskiold,                and
Tissandier, have studied          this interesting problem, and have brought
forward many facts in support of the cosmic origin of some of the
metallic particles found in atmospheric                 precipitations.        It is certain
that serious       objections    may be raised against            the origin of a large
number of so-called cosmic dusts.
    In    a great many cases      it  can be shown that these dusts                are com
posed      of the same minerals          as the    terrestrial rocks which are to be
met    with    at short distances       from the spot where the dust has been
collected,     and we can attribute a cosmic origin only to the metallic
iron     in   these dusts.      It   is somewhat          astonishing,      however,     that
no trace is ever found in these dusts of meteoric                     silicates,   although
in a great        many     meteorites     it might       be    said    that the      iron is
only      accidentally present,        while     the    silicates    predominate.         On
the other hand,          having regard        to    the    mineralogical composition
of meteorites,      it appears      strange     that the so-called           cosmic     dusts
should present         characters     so   variable,    from the point of view of
their mineralogical        composition,     in the different regions where they
have been collected.          It  might also be objected             that even the iron,
nickel, and cobalt could come from volcanic rocks in decomposition
in which these bodies are sometimes                    present,     and    this objection
would seem quite natural, especially in our particular case, when we
remember the numerous volcanic fragments in decomposition                             on the
bottom of the       sea.    Again, according to numerous researches, native
iron is found, although rarely, in various rocks and sedimentary                       layers
of the globe.        A   reduction of the oxide of iron into metal might also
be admitted        under the influence          of organic      substances.        It  might
still further    be objected    in opposition to the cosmic origin of the fine
particles of native iron that they might be carried by aerial currents

case   of the ocean, from steamers.              All   our materials of combustion
furnish considerable          quantities of iron dust, and it would not                    be
astonishing to find that this, after having been transported                         by   the
winds, should again fall on the surface of the earth at great                             dis
tances from its source.
    Such are the objections which present themselves when it is                          pro
posed to pronounce           upon the      origin     of particles      which      we are
inclined to regard       as cosmic,     and of which we propose              here to give
a short description.          We shall    see   that many of these doubts             are at
once removed         by a statement of the circumstances                   under which
cosmic spherules        are found in deep sea deposits, and            it will   be found
also that all the objections         arc disposed      of when we show the             asso
ciation of metallic spherules with the most characteristic                      bodies of
undoubted meteorites.
    In  the first   place, the considerable          distance    from    land at which
we find cosmic        particles in greatest abundance in deep               sea deposit*,
eliminates     at once objections        which might be raised with             respect    U>
 metallic   particles   found in tho neighbourhood of inhabited                 countries.
 On the other hand, tho form and character of the spherules of                       extra
terrestrial    origin are essentially       different      from  thoso collected        near
manufacturing centres.              These      magnetic       spherules      have     never
elongated      necks     or   a cracked      surface      like those      derived      from
furnaces     with which wo have carefully-               compared      them.       Neither
arc tho magnetic spherules            with   a  metallic centre comparable           cither
in their form or structure            to thoso particles        of native     iron   which
 have been described          in the eruptive rocks, especially in the             basaltic
rocks of tho north of Ireland, of Iceland,               &c
    Having referred         to the objections,       let us now see on what we
 must rely, in support         of the hypothesis        that many of the magnetic
 particles   from the bottom        of the     sea  which are specially         abundant
in those regions where tho rate of accumulation                      of the deposit it
 exceedingly      slow,   are of    cosmic     origin.       If we plunge a magnet
 into an oceanic deposit, specially           a red    clay from the central           parte
 of the Pacific, we extract          particles,    some of which are magnetite
from volcanic rocks,             and to which         vitreous     matters      aro often
 attached;    others again aro quite isolated, and differ in most of their
properties      from     the    formor.     The latter aro          generally       round.

is quite covered with a brilliant black coating having all the properties
of magnetic oxide of iron, often there may be noticed upon them cup-
like depressions clearly marked.           If we break down these spherules
in an agate mortar, the brilliant         black coating      easily falls away and
reveals white or grey metallic malleable          nuclei,    which may be beaten
out by the pestle into thin lamellae.             This metallic centre, when
treated with an acidulated       solution of sulphate of copper, immediately
assumes a coppery coat, thus showing that             it  consists of native iron.
But   there    are some malleable       metallic nuclei extracted          from tho
spherules which do not give this reaction               ; they    do not tako     tho
copper coating.        Chemical reaction      shows that they contain cobalt
and nickel    ;  very probably they constitute       an alloy of iron and these

in large quantities hinders the production of the coppery coating on
the iron.       G. Eose has shown that this coating of black oxide of
iron is found on the periphery of meteorites              of native iron, and its
presence is readily understood          when we admit their cosmic origin.
Indeed, these       meteoric    particles   of native iron in          their transit
through the air must undergo combustion,                 and, like small portions
of iron from a smith's anvil, bo transformed             either entirely or at the
surface only into magnetic         oxide, and in this latter case the nucleus

 it.
     One may suppose             that meteorites        in their     passage through the
 atmosphere        break       into   numerous         fragments,      that     incandescent
 particles    of iron are thrown off all round them,                       and that        these
 eventually fall to the surface of the globe as almost impalpable dust,
 in the form of magnetic oxide of iron more or less completely
 fused.     The luminous trains of falling stars are probably due to                          the
combustion of these innumerable particles resembling                              the   sparks
 which fly from a ribbon of iron burnt in oxygen, or the particles of
the same metal thrown off when striking a flint.                         It is easy to show
that these particles in burning take a spherical form, and are                               sur
rounded by a layer of black magnetic oxide.
     Among the magnetic grains found in the same conditions                           as these
we have just         described      are other spherules,          which we refer to           the
chondres,      so that     if   the interpretation of a cosmic                origin for the
magnetic      spherules     with a metallic centre were not established                     in a
manner absolutely beyond                question,     it  almost    becomes so when we
tako    into account        their association        with the silicate          spherules, of
 which we        have     now to speak.             It will     be seen by the micro
scopic     details that these          spherules        have     quite the       constitution
and structure of chondres               so frequent        in meteorites        of the     most
ordinary type, and on the other hand they have never been found,
 as far as we know, in rocks of a terrestrial origin; in short, the
presence      of these      spherules      in the deep         sea deposits,       and their
association      with     the     metallic spherules,          is   a   matter     of    prime
importance.          Let      us   see    how      we      distinguish       these     silicate
spherules,      and the         points upon which             wo    rely    in    attributing
to them a cosmic origin.
     Among      the    fragments       attracted     by the       magnet       in   deep     sea
deposits    we distinguish granules             slightly larger than the spherules
with the shining black coating above described.                     These are yellowish-
brown, with a bronze-like lustre,                 and under the microscope,                it is
noticed      that     the     surface,    instead       of   being     quite     smooth,        is
grooved       by    thin     lamellae.       In   size they      never    exceed      a milli
metre,    generally they are about               0'5     mm.    in diameter;         they    are
never perfect       spheres, as in the case of the black spherules                     with      a
metallic centre       ; and     sometimes      a   depression      more or less       marked

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                           493
is to be observed in the periphery.              When   examined       by the micro
scope we observe that the lamella: which compose                  them are applied
the one against          the other, and    have a radial eccentric       disposition.
It    is  the    leafy radial structure (radialblattri<j), like that of the
cJumdres of bronzite, which predominates              in our    preparations.      We
have observed much less rarely the serial structure of the chondres
with, olivine, and indeed there is some doubt about the indications
of this last type of structure. Fig. 4 shows                   the   characters    and
texture of one of these spherules magnified                   25    diameters.      On
account of their small dimensions, as well             as  of their friability due
to their lamellar structure, it is difficult            to   polish one of these
spherules, and we have been obligod to study them                     with reflected
light, or      to   limit our observations to        the   study of the broken
 fragments.
     These spherules break up following the lamellae, which latter are
 seen to be extremely fine and perfectly              transparent.       In rotating
          Fig.  4. — Spherule   of bronzite (") from 3;"00 fathoms in the
            Central South Pacific, showing many of the peculiarities
            belonging to chondres of bronzite or enstatite.
  between     crossed     nicols they have     the  extinctions     of the rhombic
  system,    and in making use of the condenser              it  is seen that they
  have one optic axis.         It is observed also that when several of theso
  lamellae are attached,       they extinguish exactly at the same time, so
  that   everything induces us          to  believe that they form          a   single
   individual.
      In studying      these transparent and very thin fragments            with   the
  aid of a high magnifying power,           it is observed   that they are dotted

 with brown-black inclusions, disposed with                      a certain     symmetry,      and
 showing somewhat            regular contours         ;   we refer      these inclusions to
 magnetic      iron, and their presence explains how these spherules                            of
 bronzito    are extracted      by the magnet.            We would observe, however,
 that they are not so strongly magnetic                       as    those    with a metallic
 nucleus.
      Wo   designate      them     under the name of bronzite rather than of
 enstatite,    because of the somewhat               deep tint which they present ;
 thoy are insoluble           in    hydrochloric        acid.        Owing      to  the    small
 quantity of substance            at our disposal,           we were       obliged    to limit
 ourselves     to a qualitative analysis.           We      have found in them            silica,
 magnesia, and iron.
      We   have     limited our remarks           at     this time       to    these   succinct
 details,   but wo believe that we have said enough to show that                           these
 spherules      in their essential        characters       are related      to the chondres
 of meteorites,        and have       the   same mode          of formation.          In    con
 clusion, we may state that when the coating of manganese depositions,
 which surround sharks'              teeth,    ear-bones       of cetaceans         and other
 riiielpi, is broken off and pounded              in  a mortar       to fine dust, and        the
 magnetic       particles   then    extracted      by means of a magnet,               we find
 these latter to be composed               of silicate spherules, spherules with                 a
 metallic centre,        and magnetic        iron, in all respects similar to             those
 found in the deposits           in which the nodules were embedded.
      We   have     recently    examined       the    dust    collected       by melting the
 snow at the Observatory on Ben Nevis, in order                             to see   whether,
 in    that elevated       and isolated      region,      wo should         bo able     to find
 volcanic ashes         or cosmic       spherules       analogous      to    those   wo    have
described.         This atmospheric        dust, which we have examined                  micro
scopically, has not shown any particles which could with certainty
bo regarded as identical with those substances which are the subject
of this paper.          Particles of coal, fragments of ashes, and grains of
quartz predominated.               Besides     these,      thero     were      fragments       of
calcito, augite,      mica, and grains of rock of all forms and of variable
dimensions.          Those     were     associated        with     fibros     of   cotton,     of
vegetables,       splinters of limonite and             of tin — in      short,    everything
indicating      a terrestrial    origin.

 3. On the Nomenclature,               Origin, and Distribution of Deep-
        Sea Deposits.         By John Murray and A. Eeuard.                       Com
        municated     by John Murray.
    Introduction. — The       sea   is  unquestionably         the    most    powerful
dynamic agent        on    the surface      of the globe,       and its effects      are
deeply imprinted on the external           crust of our planet ; but among the
sedimentary     deposits which are attributed to its action,               and among
the effects    which it has wrought on the surface features                      of the
earth, the attention of geologists         has,   till within quite      recent times,
been principally     directed   to the phenomena         which take place in the
immediate    vicinity of     the land.      It  is incontestable      that the action
of the sea along      coasts and in shallow water has played the largest
part in the formation and accumulation of those                    marine sediments
 which, so far as we can observe, form the principal                    strata   of the
solid crust of the globe ; and          it  has been from an attentive study
of the phenomena         which take place along            the   shores    of modern
seas   that wo havo been able to reconstruct                  in some degree the
conditions    under which the marino deposits of ancient times were
laid down.
    Attention has been paid only in          a  very limited degree to deposits
 of tho same order       and,   for the greater part, of the same origin,
which differ from the sands and gravels                of the shores and shallow
 waters   only by a lesser size of tho grains,              and by tho fact        that
 they are laid down at a greater              distance    from the land and in
 deeper water.     And still       less  attention has        been    paid to those
 true deep-sea deposits       which are only known through systematic
 submarine    investigations.         One might        well    ask   what      deposits

496                    Proceedings      of the Royal         Society
bottom     of the great oceans at points far removed                     from land, and
in   regions where      the  erosive and transporting             action    of water   has
little or no influence.         Without denying that               the    action of    the
tidal waves      can,   under certain special conditions, exert an erosive
and transporting power at great depths in the ocean, especially                         on
submerged peaks and barriers,           it is none     the less certain that these are
exceptional cases, and that the action of waves is almost exclusively
confined     to the coasts of emerged           land.      There are in the Pacific
immense     stretches of thousands of miles where we do not encounter
any land, and       in  the   Atlantic    wo have        similar conditions.        What
takes    place   in these     vast   regions      where      the   waves     exercise   no
mechanic      action on any solid object         1    We    are about to answer this
question    by reference      to the   facts which an examination of deep-
 sea sediments     has furnished.
    A study of       the sediments       recently collected         in the      deep   sea
 shows    that their nature       and   mode       of formation,      as   well  as  their
geographical      and bathymetrical distribution,               permit deductions       to
 be   made     which have       a great    and      increasing    importance      from   a
 geological    point of view.         In   making known the composition                 of
 these deposits    and their distribution, the first outlines of a geological
 map of the bottom        of the ocean will be sketched.
     This is not the place to give            a   detailed history of the various
 contributions to our knowledge of the terrigenous                    deposits   in  deep
 water near land, or of those true deep-sea deposits far removed from
 land, which may be said to form the special subject of this                         com
 munication.       From the time of the first expeditions,                   undertaken
 with a view of ascertaining the depth of the ocean, small quantities
 of   mud     have    been collected      by the sounding            lead    and briefly
 described.      We    may    recall  in this connection          the experiments       of
 Eoss and the observations         of Hooker and Maury.                These investiga
tions,   made     with more or less imperfect appliances,                  immediately
fixed the attention, without, however,                giving sufficient     information
on which to establish          any general conclusions as to the nature of
the deposits     or their distribution in the depths of the sea
    When      systematic    soundings were undertaken with a view of
establishing telegraphic communication between Europe and Americ*,
the attention of many distinguished men was directed to the im
portance,    in  a  biological and geological            sense, of the specimens of

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                 497
mud brought up from great depths.                     The observations       of Wallich,
Huxley,      Agassiz,     Baily, Pourtales, Carpenter,           Thomson, and many
others, while not neglecting            mineralogical and chemical composition,
deal with this only in          a subordinate      manner.       The small quantities
of   each    specimen      at their command,           and the limited        areas from
which     they     were   collected,    did not permit the            establishment        of
any    general      laws    as   to   their   composition or geographical               and
bathymetrical          distribution.        These      early    researches,     however,
directed      attention to the         geological     importance       of deep-sea       de
posits,    and prepared        the way      for tho expeditions organised              witli
the   special     object    of a scientific exploration           of the great       ocean
basins.
    The     expedition of the "Challenger" takes                    tho first rank        in
these investigations.            During that expedition a large amount of
material was collected            and   brought to England            for fuller study
under the charge of Mr Murray, who has in several preliminary
papers pointed out the composition                and varieties     of deposits      which
are now forming over the floor of the great oceans.                          In  order    to
arrive    at    results    as   general    as   possible,   it   was resolved       to   in
vestigate       the   subject      from     the    biological,     mineralogical, and
chemical points of view, and M. Renard was associated with Mr
Murray in        the work.       In   addition to the valuable collections and
observations made by the             " Challenger,"       we have had for examina
tion material collected by other British            ships, such as the "Porcupine,"
"Bulldog," "Valorous," "Nassau,"                      "Swallow," "Dove;"               and,
through Professor Mohn,               by the Norwegian North              Atlantic      Ex
pedition.        Again,    through      the    liberality    of   the   United      States
Coast      Survey      and     Mr A.       Agassiz,     the     material amassed          in
the splendid         series   of soundings taken by the American                     ships
 " Tuscarora," "        Blake,"     and " Gettysburg,"           were   placed     in our
hands.       The results at which we have arrived may therefore                   be said
to have been derived from a study of all the important available
 material.
   The work connected              with the examination and description of
these large       collections is not yet completed,             but it is sufficiently
advanced       to permit some general            conclusions     to be drawn, which
appear to bo of considerable             importance.        In   addition to descrip
tions and results,         we    shall    briefly state     the    methods      we    have

498                   Proceedings      of (he Royal     Society
adopted     in the study.         All   the details of our research            will    be
given in the Report on the Deep-Sea Deposits in the "Challenger"
 series, which     will  be accompanied        by charts      indicating the distri
 bution, plates showing the principal types of deposits                   as seen by
 the microscope,      and   numerous analyses         giving the chemical          com
 position and its relation to the            mineralogical composition.              The
 description of each sediment          will   be accompanied       by an enumera
 tion of the organisms         dredged   with the sample, so       as to   furnish all
 the biological and mineralogical information                which wo      possess    on
 deep-sea    deposits,    and finally, we shall          endeavour      to establish
 general conclusions which can only be indicated at present.
    Before   entering on the subject, we believe it right to point                   out
the difficulties which necessarily         accompany      such a research        as the
one now under consideration, difficulties which arise often                     in  part
 from the small quantity of the substance              at our disposal,       but   also
 from the very nature        of the deposit.       Since we have endeavoured
 to   determine,     with     great   exactitude,     the    composition        of   the
 deposit   at any given point, we have, whenever               possible,    taken    the
 sample collected     in the sounding tube.         That procured by the trawl
 or dredgo, although usually much larger, is not considered                   so satis
 factory on account of the washing and sorting to which the deposit
 has been      subjected   whilo     being hauled through a great                 depth
 of water.       We have,       however,     always examined          carefully      the
 contents    of these     instruments, although we             do   not    think tho
 material gives such a just idea of the deposit           as the sample collected
 by the sounding tube.           The material collected         by the last     named
instrument has been taken as the basis of our investigations, although
the small quantity often gives          to  it  an inherent difficulty.         It  was
the small quantity of substance            collected   by the sounding tube in
early expeditions which prevented               the first observers      from arriv
ing at any definite results        ; but when such small samples are sup
plemented      by occasional large hauls from the dredge or trawl, they
become     much     more    valuable and indicative of the nature of                the
deposit as a whole.        Not only    the scantiness of the material,        but   the
small size of the grains,       which in most instances make up              deep-sea
deposits,   render    the determinations difficult           In   spite   of the im
provements      recently effected in       tho microscopical       examination of
minerals,   it  is impossible to apply all tho optical           rosourcos     of   the

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                     409
instrument        to the determination of the species                     of extremely fine,
loose, and fractured             particles.       Again,     the examination            of these
deposits     is rendered difficult          by the presence             of a large     quantity
of amorphous          mineral matter, and of shells, skeletons, and minute
particles     of     organic      origin.       It    is   also      to   be   observed      that
we     have   not to deal with pure and unaltered mineral fragments,
but with particles upon which                 the chemical action of the sea has
wrought great changes, and more or less destroyed their distinctive
characters.
    What still further complicates                these researches is the endeavour
to   discover the origin of the heterogeneous                       materials which         make
up the deposits.           These have been subjected to the influence of                         a
great number of agents of some of which our knowledge is to a great
extent     still in its infancy.            We must take into account                    a  large
number of agents and processes, such                       as   ocean      currents;     the dis
tribution     of temperature          in   the water at          the surface        and at the
bottom ; the distribution            of organisms        as  dependent on temperature
and specific gravity of the water; the influence                          of aerial    currents;
the carrying       power of rivers; the limit of transport by waves; the
eruptions of aerial           and   submarine volcanoes            ;   the effect of glaciers
in transporting mineral particles, and, when melting, influencing the
specific gravity of the water,             which in turn affects the animal and
 plant life of the surface.              It  is    necessary       to study the        chemical
 reactions    which take place in great depths                  ;   in short, to call to our
 aid all    the assistance         which the physical             and biological sciences
 can   furnish.      It will     thus be understood that the tusk, like all first
 attempts      in a new field, is one             of exceptional difficulty,             and   de
 mands continued effort to carry               it  to a successful issue.
     In presenting         a   short resume of our methods,                   of   the    nomen
 clature we have adopted, and of the investigation                          into the origin of
 the deposits in the deep sea ami deeper parts of the littoral                             zones,
 we offer      it  as   a  sketch of our research,              prepared       to modify      the
 arrangements         in     any way        which      an     intelligent       criticism    may
 suggest.
     Before proceeding          to a description of methods and of the varieties
  of   deposits,    with their         distribution       in   modern        oceans,    we    will
  briefly enumerate         the materials which our examination has shown
  take part    in  the formation of theso deposits,               state the origin of these

    Materials.  — The materials which unite            to   form    the deposits
which wo have to describe may be divided into two groups, viowed
in relation to their origin, viz., mineral and organic.
    The mineral particles carried into the ocean have a different form
and size, according to the agents which have been concerned in their
transport.      Generally speaking, their size diminishes writh distance
from the coast, but here wo limit our remarks to the mineralogical
character    of the particles.     We find isolated fragments of rocks            and
minerals coming from the crystalline and schisto-crystalline                  series,
and from the clastic and sedimentary formations              ;  according to       the
nature of the nearest coasts they belong to granite, diorito,              diabase,
porphyry, &c,     ;  crystalline schists, ancient limestones, and the            sedi
 mentary rocks of all geological ages, with the minerals which                  come
 from their disintegration,        such   as quartz, monoclinic      and triclinic
felspars,   hornblende, augite, rhombic pyroxene, olivine, muscovit'',
 biotite, titanic and magnetic iron, tourmaline, garnet, epidote,                 and
other secondary        minerals.    The trituration     and    decomposition        of
those rocks and minerals give rise to materials more or less amorphous
and without distinctive        characters,   but the origin of which        is indi-
 enk'd by association with the rocks and minerals just mentioned.
    Although the debris of continental land to which                we have just
referred    plays the most important role in the immediate vicinity
 of shores,    yet our researches      show beyond doubt          that when         we
pass out towards the         central parts of the great ocean basins,              the
debris of continental rocks gradually disappears             from the     deposits,
 and its place is taken by materials     derived frommodern volcanic           rock?,
such as basalts,      trachytes, augito-andosites,    and vitreous varieties of
 these lithological     families, for instance, pumice and loose incoherent
 volcanic    particles    of recent eruptions,       with their     cliaracteristic
 minerals.     All   these   mineral substances      being usually       extremely
 tine  or areolar   in structure,   are easily attacked by the sea water             at
 the- place   where they are deposited.          This chemical action          brings
about an alteration of the minerals and vitroous fragments,                    which
soon    passes   into complete decomposition, and in special                 circum
 stances gives rise to the formation of secondary          products.       In   some

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84                                 HOI
places    the bottom of the           sea   is  covered     with deposits       due    to
this chemical       action,    principal     among      which     is   clayey matter,
associated     with which       there    are   often concretions composed              of
manganese and iron.           In other    regions the reactions        which result in
the formation       of argillaceous matter from volcanic                products give
rise also to the formation of zeolites.
    Among      other products arising from             chemical action, probably
combined with the activity            of organic matter, may be mentioned
the   formation      of glauconite       and     phosphatic       nodules,    with,    in
some rare       and doubtful      examples,      the   deposition of silica.        The
decomposition of the tissues, shells, and skeletons of organisms                     add
small   quantities of iron, fluorine, and phosphoric acid to the in
organic constituents of the deep-sea deposits.
    Finally,   we must mention extra-terrestrial substances                in the form
of cosmic     dust.
    We now pass to the consideration of the role played by organisms
in the formation of marine deposits.                Organisms living at the sur
face  of the ocean, along tho coasts, and at the bottom of the                  sea, are
continually extracting the lime, magnesia, and silica held in solution
in  sea water.      The shells and skeletons of these, after tho death of
the animals and plants, accumulate              at the bottom and         give rise to
 calcareous     and siliceous      deposits.       Tho     calcareous     deposits    are
 made up      of the    remains    of   coccospheres,       rhabdosphores,       pelagic
 and deep-sea      Foraminifera,     pelagic and       deep-sea     Molluscs,   Corals,
 Altyonarians,      Polyzoa,     Echinoderms,        Annelids,      Fish,   and    other
 organisms.      The siliceous deposits are formed principally of frustules
 of Diatoms, skeletons of Radiolarians,             and spicules of Sponges.
    While     the   minute pelagic      and deep-sea organisms             above   men
 tioned   play by far the most important                part in the formation of
 deep-sea    deposits,    the    influence     of    vertebrates      is  recognisable
 only  in  a  very slight degree in some special regions by the presence
 of largo numbers of sharks' teeth, and the ear bones and a few other
 bones   of whales.       Tho otoliths of fish are usually presont               in the
 deposits,   but, with tho excoption of two           vertebra;    and a scapula,     no
 other bones      of fish have been detected             in   the   large   amount of
 material wo have examined.
     Agents. — Having      passed in review the various materials which

502                        Proceedings       of   the       Royal Society
go to      the formation         of deposits in the                   deep     water immediately
surrounding          the land       and in the truly oceanic                      areas,    attention
must now be directed to the agents which                                     are concerned        in     the
transport and distribution               of these, and to the sphere of their action.
The relations existing between the organic and inorganic elements
of deposits          to which     just referred, and the laws
                                    we have                                                        which
determine their distribution, will be pointed out at the same                                     time.
     The fluids which envelope                 the solid crust of the globe are in
cessantly at work           disintegrating          the materials of the land, which,
becoming loose and transportable, are carried away sometimes                                              by
the atmosphere,           sometimes      by water, to lower regions, and arc eventu
ally borne to the ocean in the form of solid particles or                             as matter in
solution.       The atmosphere            when agitated, after having broken                             up
the      solid rock, transports the particles                        from the continents,               and
in some regions           carries    them     far out to             sea,    where they form             an
appreciable portion of the deposit                      ;    as,    for instance,     oft' the         west
coast of .North        Africa and        the south-west coast of Australia.                       Again,
in    times of volcanic          eruptions, the dust and scoria which are                              shot
into the air, are carried immense                           distances by winds and                 atmo
spheric currents, and no small portion eventually falls into the                                       sea.
     Water     is,   however,       the most        powerful agent concerned                      in    the
formation and distribution                  of marine sediments.                   Running         water
corrodes the surface of the land, and carries the triturated fragments
down into the ocean.                The waters of the ocean, in the form of                        waves
and tides, attack the coasts and distribute                                 the debris at    a     loner
leveL       Independently           of the action of waves, there                         exist    along
most coasts currents, more or less constant, which                               have an effect           in
removing       sand,       gravel, and pebbles                     further    from   their        origin.
Generally, terrestrial matters appear to be distributed by these                                  means
to   a   distance    of   one or two hundred                 miles from the coast.                Waves
and currents probably have no erosive                               or transporting         power         at
depths greater than 200 or 300 fathoms, and even at such depths
it    is   necessary      that      thero    should           bo     some      peculiar    configura
tion of the bottom in order that the agitated water may produce
any mechanical effect.               However,        it      is     not improbable that,               by a
peculiar      configuration         of    the bottom and                    ridges among      oceanic
islands, the         deposit on       a     ridge    may bo            disturbed by the tidal
wave       even at 1000 fathoms;             and this may be the cause of the hard

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                  503
ground sometime          met with      in such positions.        By observations off
the coast    of France, it has been shown that fine mud is at times
disturbed    at    a  depth of 150 fathoms; but, while                admitting        that
this is the     case    on exposed         coasts,  the  majority of observations
indicate that beyond 100 fathoms it is an oscillation                    of the water,
rather than    a   movement capable of exerting               any geological action,
which concerns us in this connection.
    Although     the great oceanic currents have no direct influence upon
the   bottom,      yet they have          a  very important       indirect      effect   on
deposits, because the organisms which live in the warm                         equatorial
currents form a very large part of the sediment being                           deposited
there,    and this      in   consequence       differs greatly from the deposits
 forming    in    regions     where      the    surface-water is     colder.       In   the
same way       a    high     or low     specific gravity       of the surface-water
 has an important         bearing on the animal and vegetable                 life of the
 ocean, and this in its turn affects the character of the deposits.
    The thermometric observations of the " Challenger" show that                           a
 slow movement of cold water must take place in all the greater depths
 of the ocean from the poles, but particularly from the southern pole,
 towards the equator.            It  could be shown from many lines of argu
 ment that this extremely slow massive                movement of the water can
 have no direct influence on the distribution              of marine sediments.
    Glaciers which eventually become                icebergs,   that are carried far
 out to sea by currents,           transport detrital matter from the land to
 the ocean, and thus modify            in  the   Arctic and Antarctic       regions     the
 deposits taking place        in  the regions affected by them.           The detritus
 from   icebergs     in    the    Atlantic     can   be  traced    as   far     south    as
 latitude 36° off the American coast, and in the southern hemisphere
 as far north as latitude 40°.
    The fact that    sea   water retains fine matter in suspension           for  a  much
 shorter time than fresh water should be referred                 to here as having
 an  important influence in limiting          the distribution    of line argillaceous
 and other materials borne down to the sea by rivers, thus giving a
 distinctive character to deposits forming near land.
    We have pointed out the influence of temperature                      and     salinity
  upon the distribution        of the surface organisms whose skeletons form
  a large  part of some oceanic            deposits,   and may state also that the
  bathymetrical distribution          of calcareous     organisms is influenced by

the chemical        action of sea water.      We will return to these        influences
presently       when describing tho distribution           of the various kinds         of
deposits      and their reciprocal relations, especially in those           regions     of
the deep        sea far removed       from the      mechanical action of           rivers,
 waves,      and   superficial currents.     The action of life as        a geological
 agent has been indicated under the heading                Materials.

       The description of tho deposits            has been made        upon this plan
   which       was   adopted    after   many     trials   and    much    consideration.
   This is not the place to give the reasons which have                                 us
                                                                              guided
   in adopting this mode of description,           or to give in detail the methods
   that we have         systematically employed        for all the sediments        which
   we are engaged in describing.          These    will  be  fully given in    the intro
   duction to our "Challenger" Report.                  We limit ourselves        here to
   explaining the meanings and arrangement               of terms and abbreviations,
   so that the method may be understood              and made available for others.
        The description commences by indicating the kind of                deposit (red
   clay, bluo mud, globigerina ooze, &c), with the microscopic                     charac
   ters of the deposit,      when wet or dry.
        We    have always endeavoured        to give a complete chemical analysis
    of the deposit,       but when it      was impossible        to do this we ha«
                                               of                      Calcium.       This
   always determined          the amount            Carbonate      of
   determination was generally           made by estimating         the carbonic      ^

We usually              took      a   gramme         of     a mean sample           of the substance for
this purpose, using weak and cold hydrochloric acid.                                           However,        as
the deposits often contain carbonates                             of magnesia and iron as well,
the        results      calculated         by associating the                carbonic acid          with     the
lime are not perfectly exact,                        but these carbonates of magnesia and
iron are almost always in very small proportion, and the process                                              is,
we    think,           sufficiently     accurate,           for, owing to the sorting of the
elements           which        goes on during               collection        and    carriage,      no      two
samples from the same station give exactly the same percentage.
The number which follows the words " Carbonate of Calcium " indi
cates the percentage                  of CaC03        ;     we then give the general designa
tions of the principal calcareous organisms                               in     the deposit.
     The part            insoluble      in      the       hydrochloric         acid, after the deter
mination of the carbonic acid,   designated in our descriptions
                                                            is
"
  Residue." The number placed after this word indicates its per
centage           in    the     deposit;        then        follow     the     colour        and    principal
physical           properties.         This      residue         is    washed        and submitted            to
decantations, which separate                          the several        constituents according to
their density; these form three groups                                — (1) Minerals, (2) Siliccoiw
Organisms, (3) Fine Washings.
     Minerals. — The number within brackets indicates the percent
      1.
age    of particular minerals and fragments of rocks.                                   This       numl>er    is
the result of an approximate evaluation, of which we                                          will give      the
basis       in our      report.       As   it   is   important to determine the dimensions
of the grains of minerals which                              constitute the deposit,                we    give,
after       the    contraction m. di., their mean diameter in millimetres.
We give next              the form of the grains,                if   they are rounded or angular,
&c;         then the enumeration of the species of minerals and rocks.
In this enumeration                   we have         placed      the    minerals in the order of
the importance of the role                       which they play in the deposit.                             The
specific          determinations           have been             made        with    the     mineralogical
microscope             in parallel or convergent polarised light.
      2.    Siliceous Organisms.             — The number               between       brackets      indicates
 the percentage                of siliceous organic              remains     ;    we obtain        it   in   the
 same       manner as that placed after the word Minerals.                                    The siliceous
 organisms and their fragments                            are examined with                the microscope
 and determined.                  We    have         also    placed      under        this    heading the
 glauconitic           caste    of the Foraminifera and other calcareous organisms.

   3.  Fine    Washings.- — We designate            by    this name the particles
which, resting in suspension,           pass with the first decautation.           They
are about 0-05       mm. or less in diameter.            We    have been unable to
arrange    this microscopic matter under the category                    of Mineral*,
for, owing to its minute and fragmentary nature, it is impossible                       to
determine      the species.         We     have  always found         that    the   Fine
 Washings    increase  in quantity       as the  deposit passes to       a clay, and it
is from this puiut of view that the subdivision                has its raison d'etre.
We    often   designate    the lightest particles by the name argillaceous
mutter,    but    usually     there    are   associated     with    this   very small
particles of indeterminable             minerals    and fragments of siliceous
organisms.       The number within brackets which follows                    the words
Fine    Washings is obtained in the same manner                as those placed after
Minerals and Siliceous Organisms.
   These few words      will    suffice to render the descriptions intelligible.
Greater details will be given,         as  already stated, in the " Challenger"
Report.      It  may be added         that in the majority of cases we              have
solidified the sediments        and formed them into          thin slides for     micro
scopic    examination,       and     that at all     times    the examination          by
transmitted light has been carried on at the same time as the exami
nation by reflected        light.     Each description        is followed by       notes
upon the dredging or sounding, upon the animals collected,                        and a
discussion of the analysis whenever               a complete       analysis has     been
made, which is always the case with typical samples of the                     deposits.
   Kinds of      Deposits.   — Wo now        proceed to the description          of   the
various types of deposits          into which      it  is proposed      to divide the
marine formations that are now taking place in the deeper                         water
of the various oceans and          seas.     We will speak first of those which
aro met    with in the       deeper    water of inland       seas,   and around      the
coasts of continents and islands, and afterwards of those which                       are
found in the abysmal regions               of the great oceans.           Those    coast
formations which are being laid down on the shores,                        or in    very
shallow water,      and which have been           somewhat carefully described
previous to the recent deep-sea explorations, are here neglected.
   A study of the collections mado by the " Challenger " and other
expeditions show     —

                          of Edinburjh, Session 1883-84.                               507
which are neither of volcanic nor coral origin, the sediments are
essentially composed of             a  mixture of sandy and amorphous matter,
with     a few remains of surface organisms, to which we give the name
of muds, and which may be distinguished                    macroseopically by their
colour.        We      distinguish       them    by   the   names,       blue,   red,  and
green muds.
     (2)   Around volcanic islands the deposits             are chiefly composed          of
mineral fragments derived from the decomposition of volcanic rocks.
These, according to the size of the grains, are called                     volcanic muds
or sands.
     (3)   Xear coral islands          and   along shores     fringed by coral reefs,
the deposits       arc calcareous,       derived chiefly from the disintegration
of the neighbouring             reefs,   but they receive        large    additions from
shells and skeletons of pelagic organisms,                  as well as from animals
living     at the bottom.         These    are named, according to circumstances,
rural or coralline muds and sands.
     Let   us now see what are the chief characteristics of each of these
deposits.
     Blue mud is the most extensive deposit now forming around the
great continents           and    continental    islands,    and     in all   enclosed    or
partially enclosed          seas.     It is characterised    by    a slaty colour which
passes     in   most    cases   into a thin layer of        a   reddish colour at the
 upper     surface.       These deposits are coloured blue by organic matter
 in   a state    of decomposition, and frequently give off an odour of
 sulphuretted        hydrogen.         When dried,       a blue mud is greyish in
 colour, and rarely or never has the              plasticity and compactness           of  a
 true clay.       It  is finely granular, and occasionally contains fragments
 of rocks     2  centimetres      in diameter; generally, however, the minerals,
  which are derived from the continents, and are found mixed up with
 the muddy matter            in these deposits,      have    a   diameter of 0'5 mm.
 and less.       Quartz particles, often rounded, play the principal part,
  next come mica, felspar, augite, hornblende, and all the mineral
  species     which     come    from the disintegration           of the neighbouring
  lands,    or the lands traversed           by rivers which enter the sea near
  the    place    where      the     specimens     have-   been       collected.      These
  minerals      make     up the principal and characteristic portion of blue
  muds,      sometimes       forming      80 per cent,       of    the    whole    deposit.
   (Uauconite,     though generally present,           is never abundant in blue

muds.        The remains         of calcareous       organisms     are at times          quite
absent, but occasionally they form over 50 per cent.                        The      latter is
the case when the specimen               is taken at a considerable       distance from
the coast and at a moderate                  depth      These calcareous         fragment*
consist of bottom-living and pelagic Foraminifera, Molluscs, Polyzoa,
Serpuke,        Echinoderms, Alcyonarian-spicules,              Corals,   <fcc       The re
mains of Diatoms and Iiadiolarians are usually present                            Generally
speaking,        as we approach      the shore the pelagic       organisms       disappear;
and on the contrary,           as we proceed       seawards, the size of the mineral
 grains diminishes, and the remains of shore and coast organisms give
 place to pelagic ones,         till finally   a blue   mud passes into a true deep-
sea deposit.           In those regions of the ocean affected with floating in
the colour         of these deposits becomes gray rather than blue                   at great
distances        from land,      and   is further modified       by the    presence of a
greater       or    less  abundance       of glaciated     blocks and      fragments        uf
 quartz.
      Green     Muds and Sands. — As regards               their origin,    composition,
 and distribution          near the shores        of continental land,        these     muds
 and     sands        resemble     the    blue muds.         They    are   largely com
 posed       of   argillaceous      matter     and    mineral particles of         the same
 size    and      nature    as   in tho     blue    muds.     Their chief         character
 istic    is    the    presence    of   a   considerable     quantity    of    glauconiuc
  grains, either isolated        or united into concretions.          In  the latter case
  the grains are cemented             together      by a brown argillaceous           matter,
  and include,        besides quartz,      felspars,   phosphate    of lime,      and other
  minerals,       more or less altered.         The Foraminifera and        fragments of
  Echinoderms and other organisms                    in these muds are          frequently
  filled with         glauconitic substance,         and    beautiful   casts       of these
  organisms       remain    after treatment       with weak acid.       At     times there
 are few calcareous          organisms      in these deposits, and at         other tune*
 the remains of Diatoms and Iiadiolarians are abundant.                      When these
 muds       are    dried they      become       earthy  and   of a grey-green         colour.
 They frequently give out a sulphuretted                     hydrogen     odour.          The
 green colour appears sometimes                to be duo to the presence of organic
 matter, probably of vegetable origin, and to the reduction of peroiidc
 of iron to protoxide under its influence.               The green sands       differ fro"
                                                              of the argillaceous         and

 sands.
   Red Muds. — In somo localities, as for instance                 off the Brazilian
coast of America,        the deposits     dilfer from     blue muds by the large
quantity     of ochreous        matter    brought down by           the   rivers and
deposited along        the coast.     The ferruginous particles when mixed
up with the argillaceous           matter give     the whole deposit        a    reddish
colour.     These     deposits,   rich in iron in the state of limonite, do
not appear to contain any traces of glauconite,                and have relatively
few remains of siliceous         organisms.
    Vulcanic     Muds and Sands. — The muds and sands                    around vol-
cauic islands are black or grey; when dried they are rarely coherent.
Tho    mineral particles         are  generally    fragmentary, and consist               of
lapilli of the basic and acid series of modern volcanic rocks, which
are scoriaceous      or compact,     vitreous or crystalline, and usually pre
sent    traces   of alteration.       The     minerals are sometimes            isolated,
sometimes       surrounded by their matrix, and consist                principally        of
plagioclases,     sanidine,    amphibole,      pyroxene,     biotito,   olivine,       and
magnetic      iron  ; the   size of the particles       diminishes with distance
from the shore, but the mean diameter               is generally    0'5 mm.         Glau
conite does not appear to be present              in these deposits, and quartz
is also very rare or absent.           The fragments       of shells and rocks           are
frequently covered with           a coating   of peroxide    of manganese.         Shells
of calcareous       organisms     are often    present   in great abundance,            and
render the deposit        of a lighter colour.      The remains of Diatoms and
Radiolarians are usually present.
   Cored Muds.        — These    muds frequently contain as much as 95 per
cent, of carbonate of lime, which consists of fragments                of Corals, cal
careous Alga?, Foraminifera, Serpulse, Molluscs, and remains                     of other
lime-secrcting       organisms.      There is a large amount of amorphous
calcareous matter, which gives tho deposit a sticky and chalky char
acter.     The particles      may be of all sizes according          to the distance
from the reefs, the mean diameter             being   1 to 2 mm.,    but occasionally
there are largo blocks of coral and large calcareous concretions                     ;   tho
 particles   are white and red.         Remains of siliceous organisms seldom
 make up over 2 or 3 per cent, of a typical coral mud.                    The residue
 consists   usually of a small amount             of argillaceous     matter, with a
 few    fragments       of felspar    and    other volcanic minerals          ;   but off

barrier and fringing          roofs   facing continents wo may have a great
variety of rocks and minerals.               Beyond       a   depth of 1000 fathoms
off coral islands the debris of the            reefs begins to diminish, and the
remains of pelagic organisms to increase                ;   the deposit becomes more
argillaceous,     of a reddish or rose colour, and gradually passes into                    a
Globigerina ooze or a red clay.                Coral      Sands contain much            less
amorphous        matter than coral muds, but in other respects they                      are
similar,    the    sands    being usually        found nearer        the  reefs   and in
shallower water than the muds,                 except      inside lagoons.      In   some
regions the      remains     of calcareous      alga?   predominate, and in          these
cases   the name coralline mud or sand is employed to point                       out the
distinction.
    Such is    a  rapid view of the deposits found in the deeper                   waters
of the     littoral    zones,    where     the    debris from        the   neighbouring
hind plays the most important part in the formation of muds                             and
sands.     When,       however,      wo     pass   beyond       a  distance of about
200 miles from land, wo find that the deposits are characterised                         by
the great abundance of fragmentary volcanic materials which have
usually undergone          great alteration, and by the enormous              abundance
of the shells and skeletons of minute pelagic organisms which                         have
fallen to the bottom from the surface waters.                     These true     deep-sea
deposits    may bo divided         into those in which the organic elements
predominate,       and those in which the mineral constituents play                     the
chief part.       We    commence       with the former.
    Globigerina      Ooze.  — We     designate     by this name all those            truly
pelagic deposits       containing over 40 per cent, of carbonate                 of  lime,
which consists principally of the dead shells of pelagic i'oraminifera —
 Globigerina,      Orbulina,      Pulvinulina,        Ptdlenia,     Sphaeroidina,       &c.
In   some localities this deposit contains 95 per                   cent,  of carbonate
of lime.       The colour is milky white, yellow, brown, or rose,                       the
varieties of colour depending principally on the relative abundance
in  the deposit of the oxides of iron and manganese.                        This   ooze is
fine grained;       in   the   tropics some of         the Foraminifera        shells    arc
macroscopic.         When dried it        is pulverulent.         Analyses show        that
the sediment contains, in addition to carbonate of lime, phosphate
and sulphate of lime, carbonate of magnesia,                   oxides of iron and    man
ganese, and argillaceous         matters.      The residue is of       a reddish-brown

tinge.     Lapilli,     pumice,    and      glassy   fragments,       often   altered   into
palagonite,      seem always        to    be present,       and    are   frequently very
abundant.        The mineral particles           are generally      angular,    and rarely
exceed 0-08        mm.     in   diameter; monoclinic and triclinic                 felspars,
augite, olivine, hornblende,             and magnetite         are the most       frequent.
When       quartz    is present,      it   is in the      form of minute,         rounded,
probably wind-borne grains,               often   partially covered         with oxide of
iron.     More rarely we have white and black mica, bronzite,                        actino-
lite, chromite,      glauconite,     and cosmic dust.          Siliceous organisms aro
probably never absent, sometimes forming 20 per cent, of the deposit,
at other     times     they are only recognisable            after   careful   microscopic
examination.          In  some regions         the frnstulea      of Diatoms predomi
nate,  in others the skeletons of Radiolarians.
    The fine washings,         viewed      with the microscope,           are not homo
geneous.      The greater part consists of argillaceous matter coloured by
the oxides of iron and manganese.                  Mixed with this, wo distinguish
fragments      of minerals       with      u  diameter      less than      O05 mm., and
minute particles of pumice               can nearly always be detected.                Frag
ments of Radiolarians, Diatoms, and                   siliceous    spicules    can always
be recognised,       and are sometimes          very abundant.
    Pleropod     Ooze.  — This    deposit differs in no way from a Globigerina
ooze    except in the         presence      of a greater number and variety of
pelagic organisms,         and especially        in the presence of Pteropod and
 Heteropod      shells, such as Diacria, Atlanta, Styliola, Carinaria,                   &c,
&c.     The shells of the more delicate species of pelagic Foraminifera
and young shells are also more abundant in these deposits than iu a
 Globigerina     ooze.      It must    be remembered         that the name " Pteropod
      "
ooze     is not intended to indicate that the deposit is chiefly composed
 of the shells of these molluscs,             but, as their presence in a deposit is
 characteristic      and    has   an important bearing             on geographical       and
 bathymetrical       distribution, we think it desirable               to emphasise       the
 presence of these shells          in any great abundance.                 It may here bo
 pointed    out that there        is a very considerable           difference    between     a
 Globigerina      ooze,  or a Pteropod ooze situated near continental shores,
 and deposits       bearing the same names               situated    towards tho centres
 of oceanic areas, both with respect               to mineral      particles   and remains
 of organisms.
     Diatom     Ooze.   — This   ooze is of a pale straw colour, and is composed

 principally of the frustulcs of Diatoms.               "When     dry it is a dirty
white siliceous flour, soft to tho touch, taking the impression of                    the
fingers,  and contains gritty particles which can bo recognised                by     the
touch.     It contains on an average about 25 per cent, of carbonate
of lime, which exists in tho deposit in the form of small Globigerina
shells, fragments     of Echinoderms and other organisms.                Tho residue
is pale white and slightly plastic         ;  minerals and fragments of rocks
arc in some cases abundant        ;  these arc volcanic, or, more frequently,
fragments and minerals coming from continental rocks and trans
ported by glaciers.       The fine washings consist essentially of particles
of Diatoms along with argillaceous and other amorphous matter.
We    estimate that the frustules of Diatoms and skeletons of siliceous
organisms     make up more than 50 per cent, of this deposit.
   Radiolarinn     Ooze.  — It  was stated, when describing a Globigerina
ooze,  that Radiolarians were seldom,          if  ever, completely absent fmm
marine deposits.        In   some    regions    they make up        a   considerable
portion of a Globigerina        ooze, and are also         found in Diatom         ooze
and    in  the   terrigenous     deposits     of the deeper        water surround
ing, however,       tho   land.     In   some      regions of the Pacific,           the
skeletons of these organisms make                up the principal       part   of tho
            and to these we have given the name

deposits,
The colour is reddish or deep brown, due to the presence                       of    the
oxides of iron and         manganese.        Tho mineral particles consist             of
fragments     of pumice,    lapilli,  and    volcanic minerals, rarely       exceed
ing 0 07 mm. in diameter.             There is not        a trace  of carbonate of
lime    in the form of shells in some samples                of Eadiolarian       ooze,
but other     specimens     contain     20 per      cent,   of carbonate     of    lime
derived    from    tho shells of pelagic            Foraminifera.       The    clayey
matter and mineral         particles in this ooze are the same              as   those
found in the red clays, which wo will now proceed to describe.
   Red Clay. — Of all the deep-sea deposits this is the ono which                       is
distributed over the largest areas in the modern oceans.                It might      be
said   that it exists everywhere in the abysmal regions of the                  ocean
basins,   for tho residue      in the organic        deposits    which have       been
described    under tho names Globigerina, Pteropod, and Radiolarian
ooze, is nothing      else than the       red    clay.     However,    this deposit
only appears in its characteristic form in those areas where the                 terri
genous minerals and calcareous and siliceous organisms                disappear        to

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1883 -84.                                  513
a    greater or less extent from tho               bottom.       It   is in the      central
regions of        the   Pacific    that we meet with tho typical                 examples.
Like other         marine     deposits, this one        passes     laterally,     according
to    position     and   depth, into tho adjacent kinds                of deep-sea       ooze
or mud.
     The argillaceous matters are of a more or less deep brown tint from
the presence of the oxides of iron and manganese.                           In  the typical
examples no mineralogical                species   can    be    distinguished        by the
naked eye, for the grains are exceedingly fine and of nearly uniform
dimensions, rarely exceeding 005 mm. in diameter.                             It  is plastic
and greasy to the touch ; when dried                   it  coagulates      into lumps      so
coherent      that considerable force must bo employed to break                        them.
It gives    tho brilliant streak of clay, and breaks down in water.                      Tin;
pyrognostic        properties show that wo are not dealing with a puro
clay,   for it   fuses easily before the blow-pipe into a magnetic                   bead.
     Under     the term red clay are comprised those deposits in which tho
characters of clay are not well pronounced, but which are mainly com
 posed    of minute particles of pumice and                  other volcanic material
 which, owing to their relatively recent deposition, have not undergone
 great alteration.        If  we calculate the analyses          of red clay it will       be
 seen,    moreover,        that    tho    silicate  of    alumina       present     as   clay
 ('2SiO.„Al.,0,     +  2H20) comprises only a relatively small portion of
 tho sediment, tho calculation shows always an excess of free silica,
 which is attributed chiefly to the presence of siliceous organisms.
      Microscopic      examination        shows that       a   red     clay consists        of
 argillaceous       matter,     minute     mineral     particles,    and fragments of
 siliceous      organisms;       in   a   word, it is      in   all   respects     identical
  with    tho residue of          the    organic oozes.        The     mineral      particles
  arc for the greater         part   of volcanic origin, except            in those     cases
  where      continental       matters     are   transported       by    floating    ice,   or
  where the sand         of deserts has been carried to great distances                    by
  winds.      These volcanic        minerals are the same constituent minerals
  of modern      eruptive rocks, enumerated           in the description of volcanic
  lands and sands        ;   in  the great     majority    of   cases   they aro accom
  panied    by fragments        of lapilli and of pumice more or less altered.
  Vitreous volcanic matters             belonging to the acid and basic series of
  rocks predominate in the regions              where the red clay has its greatest
   ilevelopment,      and   it will  bo seen presently that the most              character

istic decompositions         which      there    take    place     are   associated with
pyroxenic lavas.
    Associated     with the red clay are almost always found                    concretion;
and   microscopic      particles of the          oxides     of iron     and     manganese,
to   which     the    deposit     owes      its colour.        Again,     in the typical
examples     of the      deposit,      zeolites    in the      form     of    crystals   and
crystalline spherules          are    present,     along     with      metallic     globules
and silicates      which are regarded           as of cosmic origin.             Calcareous
organisms are so generally          absent in the red clay that they cannot be
regardod as characteristic         ; when      present they are chiefly the shells
of pelagic Foraminifera, and are usually met with in                     greater numbers
in the surface layers of the deposit, to which they                         give   a lighter
colour.     On the other hand, the remains of Diatoms,                        Eadiolarians,
 and   spongo    spicules     are generally      present, and are sometimes very
 abundant.       The ear-bones          of various        cetaceans,     as    well as the
 remnants    of other cetacean bones, and the teeth of sharks,                         are, iu
 some of the typical samples far removed                    from the       continents,     es-

 embedded     in thick coatings of, oxides of iron and                 mangauese.
                                                                                          The
remains    of these       vertebrates       have    seldom       been    dredged in the
 organic oozes, and still more rarely in the terrigenous deposits.
    The fine washings, as examined              with     a  power of 450          diameters,
 are  composed of an amorphous                   matter,      fragments of          minerals
 tho   remains      of   siliceous     organisms,       and      colouring       substances.
 What     we call amorphous           matter     may be       considered         as properly
tho argillaceous       matter,    and     presents     characters      essentially      vague-
 It  appears    as   a  gelatinous       substance,      without       definite     contours,
generally    colourless,     perfectly     isotropic,    and    forms the        base which
agglutinates     the other particles        of the washings.           As    these physical
properties   are very indefinite, it is difficult to estimate                 even approxi
mately tho quantity present in a deposit.                    However, it        augments       in
proportion    as the deposit becomes more clayey, but we think that
only a small quantity of this substance is necessary to give a clayey
character    to    a deposit.        Irregular      fragments       of    minerals,        small
pieces   of vitreous      rocks,    and    remains      of siliceous organisms               pre
dominate      in    this    fundamental         base.      These particles            probaWy
make up about 50 per cent, of tho whole mass of the

  mask the      character  of the clayey matter          in which they are em
 bedded.      The mineral      particles   are seldom      larger    than    O01 mm.
 in diameter, but descend from this size to the merest points.                  It is im
 possible, on account of their minuteness, to say to what mineral species
 they belong, their optical        reactions are insensible,       their outlines too
 irregular, and all special coloration has disappeared.                  All   that can
 be reasonably     said is that these minute         mineral particles         probably
 belong to the same species as the largor particles            in the same deposit,
such as felspar, hornblende,         magnetite,     &c.     In  the case of pumico
and siliceous organisms the fragments             can, owing to their structure,
be recognised when of a much less size than              in the    case  of the above
minerals.
    It  can be made out by means of the microscope that the colouring
substances are hydrated         oxides of iron and manganese.              The formor
is scattered     through the mass in a stato of very fino division                   ;  in
some     points,   however,   it  is more localised,      the argillaceous        matter
here    appearing    with   a  browner tinge, but these spots are noticed

given by the        manganese      is much     more distinct ; there          are small
rounded      brownish spots with         a diameter     of less than        O'Ol    mm.,
which     disappear    under    the   action   of hydrochloric acid with dis
engagement of chlorine.            These small     round concretions,        which are
probably     a   mixture of the oxides         of iron and manganese,            will   bo

     Geographical and Bath y metrical Distribution.                — In   tho preceding
 pages wo havo confined our remarks                 essentially to the lithological
 nature of the        deep-sea     deposits,   including     in this term the dead
shells and skeletons          of organisms.        From this point of view it has
 been possible       to define tho sediments          and to give     them    distinctive
 names.      Wo now        proceed to consider their geographical             and batliy-
 metrical distribution,          and tho relations which exist between                 the
 mineralogical and organic            composition, and         the   different areas of
 tho ocean in which they are formed.
     A cursory    glance at the geographical           distribution      shows that the
 deposits    which wo have designated               muds and       sands are situated
 at various depths         at no great      distance    from the land, while the
 organic      oozus    and    red clays       occupy   the abysmal        regions  of tho
 ocean basins       far from      land.    Leaving     out of view the         coral   and
 volcanic muds and sands which are found principally around oceanic
 islands,   wo notice that our blue muds, green                  muds and sands, red
 muds, together with all the coast and               shore formations, are situated
 along the margins of the continents and in enclosed                       and partially
 enclosed     seas.     The    chief    characteristic of these deposits is the
 presence in them of continental debris.                 The blue muds are found
 in all tho deeper parts of the regions just indicated, and especially
 near tho embouchures           of rivers.     Rod muds do not differ much from
 bluo muds        except     in colour, due to the presence of ferruginous
 matter in groat abundance,            and we find them under the same condi
 tions  as the  blue muds.         The green muds and sands occupy, as a rule,
 portions of the          coast   where detrital       matter     from     rivers is nut
 apparently accumulating at             a rapid rate, viz., on such places         as  the
 Agulhas Bank, olf the east coast of Australia, off tho coast of Spain,
 and at various points along tho coast of America.
     Lot   us   cast    a   glance    at  tho    region occupied         by terrigenous
 deposits,    in which      wo include all truly         littoral   formations.       This
 region   extends      from high-water mark down, it               may be, to a depth
 of over four miles, and in            a  horizontal direction from 60 to per
haps    300 miles seawards, and includes,                in   the view we       take,   all
inland    seas, such as tho        North     Sea, Norwegian Sea, Mediterranean
Sea, Red Sea, China Sea,            Japan    Sea, Carribean Sea, and many others.
It   is the region        of change      and of variety with respect to light,
temperature,        motion,     and biological       conditions.        In   the surface

      waters the temperature           ranges from 80° Fahr. in the tropics,               to 28°
      Falir. in the polar regions.          Below the sinface, down to the nearly ice-
     cold water     found at the lower limits of the region                   in the deep       sea,
     there is in the tropics        an equally great range of temperature.                 Plants
     and animals are abundant                near the shore,       and animals        extend      in
     relatively great abundance              down to the lower limits of this region
     which is now covered            by these terrigenous           deposits.      The specific
     gravity of the water varies much, owing to mixture with river water
    or great     local    evaporation,        and    this variation in its          turn   affects
     the fauna and         flora.     In    the terrigenous       region tides and currents
    produce      their maximum             effect, and these influences            can in some
    instances      be traced to a depth of 300 fathoms,                 or nearly 2000 feet.
    The upper or continental               margin    of the region is cloarly defined by
    the high-water        mark of the coast-line,           which is constantly         changing
    through breaker           action,     elevation,    and subsidence.          The lower or
   abysmal margin is less clearly                marked      out.    It  passes   in most cases
   insensibly       into the abysmal           region, but may be regarded as ending
   when the mineral particles from the neighbouring                           continents     begin
   to disappear       from the deposits, which then pass into an organic ooze
   or a red clay.
       Contrast       with      these     those    conditions      which      prevail     in     the
   abysmal        region in which occur               the   organic     oozes   and     red    clay,
   the distribution          of which will presently be considered.                     This area
   comprises        vast    undulating plains from two to five miles beneath
   the surface        of the      sea,    the average being about three               miles, here
   and there        interrupted by huge volcanic cones (the oceanic islands).
  No sunlight ever reaches these deep cold tracts.                               The range of
  temperature          over them         is not more than 7°, viz., from               31° to 38°
  Fahr., and is apparently               constant throughout the whole year in each
  locality.         Plant     life is absent, and although animals belonging to
 all the great           types     are present, there is no great variety of form
  or abundance of individuals.                     Cbange     of any kind is exceedingly
 slow.
       What is         the     distribution       of deposits      in this abysmal           region
 of the         earth's      surface ?        In   the    tropical    and     temperate       zones
 of the gTeat oceans, which occupy about 110° of latitude between
 the two polar zones, at depths where the action of the waves is not
 felt, and at points to which the terrigenous materials do not extend,

518                      Proceedings      of the Royal Society
there    are now forming vast accumulations of Globigerina and other
pelagic      Foraminifera, coceolitlis, rhabdoliths, shells of [iclagie Mol
luscs, anil remains        of other organisms.         These deposits may perhaps
be called       the sediments      of median    depths and of warmer zones, be
cause they diminish in great             depths   and tend to disappear towards
the    poles.       This fact      is  evidently   in relation with the surface
temperature        of the ocean, and shows that pelagic               Foraminifera and
 Molluscs live in the superficial waters of the                sea, whence      their dead
 shells     fall   to   the   bottom.       Globigerina       ooze    is  not found         in
 enclosed      seas  nor in polar latitudes.          In the Southern Hemisphere
 it   has    not been       met    with    beyond     the    50th     parallel.     In    the
 Atlantic it       is deposited       upon the bottom at          a  very high latitude
 below     the    warm waters of the Gulf Stream,                 and is not observed
 under the cold descending              polar current which runs south in the
 same latitude.         These    facts are readily explained,          if  we  admit that
 this ooze is formed chiefly by the shells of surface organisms,                       which
 require an elevated         temperature      and   a  wide expanso         of   sea.     But
 as   long    as  tho   conditions      of tho surface are         the same we would
 expect     the deposits        at the bottom      also to remain         the same.         In
 showing that such           i6   not the case, we are led to take into account
 an agent which          is in direct correlation with the depth.                 We     may
 regard it as established          that tho majority of the calcareous                 organ
 isms,    which make         up the     Globigerina     and Pteropod oozes, live in
  the surface waters, and we may also take for granted that there is
  always    a specific    identity between       the calcareous        organisms       which
 live at tho surface, and the shells of these pelagic creatures found at
  the bottom.         This   observation     will permit      us to place      in relation
  the organic deposits        and thoso     which are directly or indirectly               the
  result of the chemical activity of the ocean.                     Globigerina       ooze is
  found in the tropical zone at depths                 which      do not oxceed          2400
  fathoms,       but when depths of 3000 fathoms are explored in this
  zoiio of the       Atlantic     and   Pacific, there    is    found an      argillaceous
  deposit without, in many instances, any trace of calcareous organisms.
   When we descend from the "submarine plateaux" to depths which
  oxceed      2250     fathoms the Globigerina          ooze     gradually disappears,
   passing    into   a  greyish marl, and finally         is wholly       replaced      by an
  argillaceous      material   which covers the bottom           at all deptlis greater
   than 2900 fathoms.

       The     transition        between      the     calcareous       formations        and      the
    argillaceous      ones     takes     place by almost         insensible       degrees.      The
    thinner and more delicate             shells    disappear      first.     The thicker and
   larger shells lose little by little the sharpness of their contour,                           and
   appear    to undergo        a  profound alteration.           They assume a brownish
   colour, and break             up in proportion         as   the calcareous        constituent
   disappears.        The      red    clay predominates           more      and    more     as    the
   calcareous element diminishes in the deposit.
      If   we now recollect             that   the   most     important elements            of the
   organic deposits have descended from the superficial                        waters, and that
  the variations        in contour of the bottom of the                  sea cannot     of them
  selves   prevent      the debris of animals           and plants from accumulating
  upon the bottom, their absence in the red clay areas can only be
  explained        by   a   decomposition,       under the action of              a cause   which
  we must seek to discover*
      Pteropod        ooze,   it will     be remembered,          is a calcareous          organic
  deposit,     in which          the   remains      of Fteropods and other                 pelagic
  Mollusca      arc present,        though    they do not always form a preponder
  ating constituent, and it has been found                     that    their presence         is in
  correlation      with    the bathymetrical distribution.
     In   studying the nature               of the     calcareous       elements      which are
 deposited        in the pelagic areas, it has been noticed                      that,   like the
 shells of the Foraminifera, those of the Thecosomatous                              Ptcropoda,
 which      live everywhere            in the superficial         waters,     especially    in the
 tropics, became          fewer hi number          as the    depth from which the sedi
 ments are derived increases.                We have just observed that the shells of
 Foraminifera disappear               gradually     as  we descend          along    a  series of
 soundings       from     a  point where the Globigcrina ooze has abundance of
carbonate       of lime,      towards     deeper regions ; but we notice               also that
 when the soilnding-rod brings up a graduated series of sediments from
a  declivity descending             into deep water, among the calcareous                   shells
those of the         Fteropods and Heteropods              disappear       first in proportion
as the   depth increases.            At  depths less than 1 400 fathoms in the tropics
a   Pteropod ooze is found with abundant remains of Heteropods                                  and
Pteropods        ;  deeper soundings then give a Globigerina ooze without
these     mulluscaa          remains;       and    in still greater depths,            as   before
mentioned,          there    is a red clay in which calcareous                  organisms        are
nearly,     if  not quite, absent.

                             Procecdimjs            of   t/ie    Royal Society
      In this    manner,        then, it is shown that the remains of calcareous
organisms        are completely eliminated in the greatest                                   depths of       the
ocean.        For if      such bo not the case, why do we find all these shells
at tho bottom in the shallower depths,                             and not at all in the                greater
depths,       although they are equally abundant on the surface at both
places    1     There is reason to think that this solution of calcareous
shells is due to tho presence of carbonic acid throughout all                                           depths
of ocean water.              It    is well known that this substance,                            dissolved    in
water, is an energetic               solvent of calcareous                matter.           The investiga
tions     of Buchanan               and      Dittmar            have    shown that carbonic                acid
exists in        a    free     state      in   sea       water,        and in the second                 place,
Dittmar's        analyses          show that deep-sea                  water contains more lime
than surface           water.        This      is    a    confirmation of the theory which
regards       carbonic acid          as the     agent       concerned         in the total or           partial

the     bottom of tho ocean, and is likewise in relation with the                                         fact,
that in high latitudes where fewer calcareous organisms are found                                            at
the surface,          their remains are removed at lesser depths than                                   where
these     organisms          are    in greater           abundance.           It    is not improbable
that    sea water     itself may have some effect in the solution of carbonate
of lime, and further, that the immense                                 pressure      to which         water is
subjected        in    great       depths,     may have            an    influence on its chemical
activity.        Wo await           the result of further                 researches on this point,
which have been undertaken in connection with the "Challenger"
Keports.         We       are aware          that objections have been raised to the
explanation           here     advanced,        on account              of the alkalinity of               sea
water,     but       we    may       remark that alkalinity                   presents           no difficulty
which need bo here considered.*
   This interpretation permits                       us    to explain         how the remains                of
Diatoms and Eadiolarians (surface organisms like the Foraminifera)
are found in greater abundance in the red clay than in a Globigerina
ooze.     The action           which suffices to dissolve the calcareous                                matter
has little or no effect upon the silica, and so the siliceous shells accu
mulate.       Nor      is this view of the case opposed                       to the distribution of
the Pteropod ooze.                 At first    we should expect that the Foraminifera
shells,   being smaller,             would          disappear          from   a    deposit before          the
Pteropod shells;             but if we remember                    that tho latter are very thin

offer a larger surface       to  the action of the solvent than the thicker,
though smaller, Globigerina             shells, we shall     see the    explanation of
this apparent anomaly.
    It remains now      to point out the area occupied by the red clay.
We have seen how it passes at its margins into organic calcareous
oozes,  found in the lesser depths of the abysmal regions, or into the
siliceous organic oozes or terrigenous deposits.                In its typical form
the red clay occupies a larger area than any of the other true deep-
sea deposits,    covering the bottom in vast regions of the North and
South Pacific, Atlantic,          and     Indian   Oceans.     As   above    remarked,
this clay may be said          to be universally distributed over the floor of
the oceanic    basins   ;   but it only appears        as  a true deposit at points
where thy siliceous and calcareous organisms                do not conceal its proper
characters.
    Having now indicated           its distribution, we must consider the mode
of its formation, and give, in addition, a concise                 description of the
minerals   and of the organic remains which are commonly associated
with it.     The origin of      these vast deposits of clay is a problem of the
highest interest.       It   was at first supposed        that these sediments were
composed of microscopic particles arising from the disintegration of
the rocks by rivers and by the waves on the coasts.                    It was believed
that the matters       held in suspension were carried far and wide by
currents, and gradually fell to the bottom of the                 sea.    But the uni
formity of composition presented               by these deposits was a great objec
tion to this view.         It  could be shown,       as we have mentioned       above,
 that mineral particles, even of the smallest               dimensions, continually
 set  adrift  upon   disturbed waters           must, owing to a property        of sea
 water, eventually be precipitated at no great distance from land.                    It
 has also been supposed that these argillaceous deposits owe their origin
 to the inorganic residue of the calcareous shells which are dissolved
 away   in deep water, but this view has no foundation in fact.                 Every
 thing seems to show that the formation of the clay is duo to the
 decomposition     of fragmentary volcanic products, whose presence can
  be detected over the whole floor of the ocean.
     These   volcanic materials are derived from floating pumice                    and
  volcanic ashes ejected to great distances by terrestrial volcanoes,               and
  carried far by the winds.         It is also  known that beds of lava and of tufa

522                     Proceedings    of the lloyal Society
are  laid down upon the bottom of the            sea.    This   assemblage of     pyro-
genic rocks, rich      in aluminous silicates,   decomposes under the chemical
action of the water, and gives rise, in the same way                 as do terrestrial
volcanic rocks, to argillaceous         matters,   according to reactions,       which
we can always observe on the surface of the globe, and which                         are
too well known to need special mention hero.
    The detailed microscopic examination of hundreds of soundings
has shown that we can always demonstrate                in the argillaceous matter
the presence        of pumice,     of lapilli, of silicates, and other volcanic
minerals in various stages of decomposition.
   As    we have      shown in another paper,* the deposit most widely
distributed over the bed of modern            seas   is duo to the decomposition
of the products of the internal activity of the globe, and the final
result of the chemical action of         sea  water is seen in the formation of
this    argillaceous     matter,    which is found everywhere in deep-sea
deposits,    sometimes       concealed  by the abundance of siliceous or cal
careous organisms,          sometimes  appearing with its own proper charac
teristics associated with mineral substances, some of which allow us to
appreciate     the extreme      slowness  of its formation, or whose presence
corroborates      the theory advanced       to explain its origin.
    In  the places where this red clay attains its most typical develop
ment, we may follow, step by step, the transformation of the volcanic
fragments      into argillaceous matter.        It  may be said to be the direct
product of the decomposition of the basic rocks, represented                   by vol
canic    glasses, such as hyalomelan and            tachylite.      This decomposi
tion, in spite of the temperature         approximating to zero (32°         F.), gives
rise, as an     ultimate product, to clearly crystallised minerals, which
may be considered the most             remarkable products of the chemical
action of the         sea    upon the volcanic matters          undergoing decom
position.       These microscopic      crystals are zeolites      lying free in the
deposit,    and    are met with in greatest abundance            in the typical red
clay areas of the central Pacific.              They     are  simple, twinned,        or
spheroidal       groups which        scarcely   exceed      half   a   millimetre     iu
diameter.        The crystallographic and chemical study of them shows
that they must be referred to Christianite.                It is known how easily
the zeolites      crystallise in the pores of eruptive             rocks in process
of decomposition          ;   and the crystals      of Christianite,       which    we

 Pacific, have been formed             at the expense of the decomposing                    vol
 canic matters spread out upon the bed of that ocean.
     In connection       with this formation          of zeolites,      reference    may be
made to a chemical          process whose principal seat is the red clay areas,
and which        gives rise to nodules          of manganiferous         iron.     This sub
stance       is almost universally distributed in oceanic sediments, yet it is
not so much of the areas of its abundance                   that we intend to speak as
to the fact      of its occurrence in the red clay, because this association
tends    to show a common relation of origin.                   It    is exactly in those
regions where there is an accumulation                    of pyroxenic lavas in decom
position,      containing silicates        with    a base     of manganese and iron,
such for example          as augite, hornblende,          olivine, magnetite, and basic
glasses,      that manganese        nodules     occur in greatest numbers.             In     the
regions wdiero the sedimentary              action, mechanical          and organic,        is,   as
it   were,    suspended,     and where, as         will   appear in the sequel, every
thing shows an extreme slowness of deposition,                  — in    these calm waters
favourable        to   chemical      reactions,     ferro-manganiferous           substances
form concretions         around     organic anil inorganic       centres.
     These concentrations           of ferric     and manganic oxides, mixed with
argillaceous materials,           whose form and dimensions           are extremely         vari
able, belong generally to the earthy variety                   or wad, but pass some
times, though rarely, into varieties               of hydrated oxide         of manganese
with distinct indications of radially fibrous crystallisation.                        The in
terpretation      to which we are led, in order to explain this formation of
manganese nodules,          is    the same as that which       is   admitted      in explana
tion of the formation of coatings of this material                       on the surf ice of
terrestrial     rocks.      These     salts of manganese and iron, dissolved                      in
water by carbonic acid, then precipitated                   in the form of carbonate of
protoxide of iron and manganese, become oxidised,                         and give rise in
the calm and. deep oceanic regions                 to more or less pure            feiro-man-
ganiferous        concretions.        At    the    same time     it   must       bo admitted
that    rivers may bring to the ocean                 a    contribution of these same
substances.
     Among       the     bodies    which, in certain          regions    where      red      clay
predominates,          serve as centres       for these manganiferous            nodules,     are
the remains of vertebrates.                These    remains    are the hardest parts of
the skeleton — tympanic bones of whales, beaks of Ziphius. teeth of

 524                     Proceedings of the Royal Society
 sharks ; and       just    as   the   calcareous      shells     are eliminated in the
 depths, so all the remains of the larger vertebrates are absent except
the most resistant          portions.      These     bones often       serve   as a centre
 for the manganese-iron            concretions,    being frequently        surrounded     by
layers several centimetres            in thickness.         In   the same dredgings on
the red clay areas, some sharks'               teeth and cetacean ear-bones, some
of which belong            to   extinct species,         are    surrounded      with thick
layers of the manganese,               and   others     with merely       a slight coating.
We      will   make     use    of these      facts    to establish       the conclusions
which terminate this paper.
     In   these red clays        there occur, in addition, the greatest             number
of cosmic      metallic    spherules,     or chondres,       the nature and characters
of which we have pointed out elsewhere.*                      We merely      indicate their
presence here, as we           will support our conclusions by              a reference to
their distribution.
    Reviewing,       then,     the distribution       of oceanic       deposits, we may
summarise       thus :—
                                                the blue muds,          green muds and

exception      of the volcanic muds            and     sands,     and   coral    muds    and
sands, around        oceanic islands,       these deposits        are found only along
the borders       of continents       and continental islands, and in enclosed
and partially enclosed seas.

and      subtropical regions          in   depths      less    than    1500     fathoms,     a

   Conclusion*.     — All     the facts and details           enumerated       in the    fore

geological interest, and which appear to be warranted by the present
state of our investigations.

       We    have       said    that the             debris         carried       away      from the            laud
 accumulates at the bottom of the sea before                                         reaching        the abysmal
 regions     of    the ocean.                 It   is only in             exceptional          cases        that the
 finest     terrigenous        matorials            are transported               several      hundred miles
 from the shores.              In   place of layers formed of pebbles and clastic ele
 ments      with grains of considerable                       dimensions,            which play so large a
 part in the composition                of emerged lands, the great areas of the ocean
 basins are covered            by the microscopic                       remains of pelagic organisms,
 or by the deposits             coming from the alteration                           of volcanic products.
 The distinctive elements                      that appear in the river and coast sedi
ments       are,       property      speaking,              wanting          in the great depths                 fur
distant from the coasts.                       To such a degree is this the                          case    that in
a great      number of soundings,                        from the centre of the Pacific for
example, we have not been able to distinguish mineral particles                                                   on
which       the mechanical              action          of water          had left       its    imprint,        and
quartz is so rare that               it   may be said to be absent.                             It   is sufficient
to     indicate these facts in order to make apparent                                           the      profound
differences which separate the deposits of the abysmal                                               areas of the
ocean       basins from the series of rocks in the geological                                         formations.
As regards          the vast deposits                   of red clay, with its manganese con
cretions, its zeolites,             cosmic dust,                  and remains          of vertebrates, and
the organic oozes which are spread out over the bod of the central
Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans, have they their analogues in
the geological series of rocks ]                             If    it    be proved       that in the sedi
mentary       strata the pelagic sediments                          are not represented,                it follows
that      deep     and     extended                oceans         like    those      of the       present        day
cannot       formerly have occupied                         the areas of the present continents,
and as a corollary the great lines of                                    the    ocean     basins         and con
tinents must have been marked                                 out from the earliest geological
ages.       We thus        get a new confirmation of the opinion of the per
manence       of the continental                   areas.
     But without          asserting           in    a    positive manner               that the terrestrial
area3     and the areas covered by the waters of the great ocean basins

areas have         a   great antiquity.                 The accumulation               of sharks' teeth, of

of   volcanic     material        in   tin  advanced      state      of    decomposition,
and   of cosmic       dust,    at points     far removed         from the continents,
prove     this.     There      is no reason        for supposing that            the parts
of the ocean where             these vertebrate       remains      are found are more
frequented by sharks or cetaceans                 than   other regions         where they
are never or only rarely dredged              from the deposits           at the bottom.
When      we    remember         also   that these     ear-bones,      teeth   of   sharks,
and   volcanic fragments,            are sometimes      incrusted with two centi
metres    of manganese           oxide, while      others    have      a   mere    coating,
and that some of the bones and teeth belong to extinct species, we
may conclude       with     great    certainty that the clays of these oceanic
basins have accumulated            with extreme slowness.           It  is indeed almost
beyond question that the red clay regions of the central Pacific con
tain accumulations belonging to geological                   ages    different from our
own.     The great antiquity of these formations is likewise confirmed
in a  striking manner by the presence of cosmic fragments, the nature
of which       we have       described.*       In order    to account for the accu
mulation of all these substances in such relatively great abundance
in the areas where they were dredged, it is necessary to suppose the
oceanic basins to have remained              the same for     a vast     period of time.
   The sharks' teeth, ear-bones, manganese nodules,                      altered   volcanic
fragments,      zeolites,     and     cosmic    dust, are met with in greatest
abundance       in the     red clays of the central Pacific, at that point on
the earth's     surface farthest removed           from continental land.             They
are less abundant in the              Radiolarian     ooze, are rare        in the Globi-
gerina,    Diatom, and Pteropod             oozes, and     they have been dredged
only in      a  few instances           in  the    terrigenous       deposits close       to
the shore.       These     substances      are present      in all the deposits,        but
owing to the         abundance         of other matters        in the       more    rapidly
forming      deposits     their     presence    is masked,        and     the   chance    of
dredging them is reduced.                  We may then regard              the  greater   or
less abundance       of these materials,         which are      so   characteristic of      a
true red clay,     as  being      a measure     of the relative rate of accumula
tion of the marine          sediments      in which they lie.            The terrigenous
deposits accumulate         most rapidly, then follow in order Pteropod ooze,
Qlobigerina ooze, Diatom ooze, Radiolarian ooze, and, slowest of all,
red clay.

    From    the data now advanced          it  appears    possible   to doduce other
conclusions important from a geological                point of view.       In  the de
posits due essentially to the action              of the ocean, wo are at once
struck    by the great variety of sediments which may accumulate                      in
regions where        the external conditions are almost           identical.     Again
marine faunas and floras, at least those of the surface, diffor greatly,
both with respect to species and to relative abundance                 of individuals,
in different regions         of the ocean    ;  and   as  their remains     determine
the character of the deposit in many instances,                  it  is legitimate to
conclude that the occurrence            of organisms      of  a  different nature in
several beds        is not an argument against           the synchronism        of the
layers which contain them.
    The small extent occupied          by littoral formations, especially those
of an     arenaceous        nature,  shown by our         investigations,     and the
relatively     slow rate      at which     such    deposits   are formed       along   a
stable coast, are matters of importance.
    In  the present state of things there does not appear to be anything
to   account for the enormous             thickness      of the clastic sediments
making      up certain geological        formations, unless         wo   consider the
 exceptional      cases    of erosion  which are brought into play when                 a
 coast is undergoing constant elevation or subsidence.                    Great move
 ments of the land aro doubtless necessary for the formation of thick
 beds of transported matter like sandstones              and conglomerates.
    In this connection        may be noted the fact that in certain regions of
 the deep    sea no     appreciable   formation is now taking place.             Hence
 the   absence,     in   the   sedimentary series, of       a layer representing       a
 definite horizon must not always be interpreted                  as   proof either of
 the emergence        of the bottom of the        sea   during the corresponding
 period, or of an ulterior erosion.             Arenaceous formations of great
 thickness require         seas   of no great extent and coasts subject to
 frequent oscillations, which permit the shores to advance and retire.
 Along    those,    through all periods        of the earth's     history, the great
 marine sedimentary phenomena             have taken place.
    The continental geological formations, when compared with marine
 deposits of modern         seas  and oceans, present no analogues to the red
 clays, Radiolarian,        Globigerina, Pteropod, and Diatom oozes.                 On
 the other hand,       the terrigenous    deposits     of our lakes, shallow       seas,
 enclosed seas, and the shores of the continents, reveal the equivalents

528                   Proceedings      of the Royal Society
of our chalks, greensands,         sandstones,    conglomerates,      shales, marls,
and    other sedimentary formations.              Such     formations     as  certain
tertiary deposits      of Italy, Radiolarian        earth    from Barbadoes,      and
portions of the Chalk where           pelagic   conditions are indicated, must
be regarded as having         been laid     down rather along the border of           a
continent than in        a  true oceanic      area.    On the other hand, the
argillaceous     and     calcareous     rocks, recently         discovered    by   I)r
Ouppy,     in the upraised       coral islands in the Solomon             group,   are
nearly identical with the volcanic muds, and probably also with the
I'teropod and Globigerina oozes of the Pacific.
    Regions situated similarly to enclosed             and    shallow   seas and the
borders of the present        continents appear to have been, throughout
all geological    ages,  the theatre of the greatest          and most remarkable
changes ;    in short, all, or nearly all, the sedimentary rocks of the
continents would seem to have been built up in areas like those
now occupied       by the terrigenous deposits, which we may designate
"  the  transitional     or critical area of the earth's surface."               This
area occupies, we estimate, about two-eighths of the earth's surface,
while the continental and abysmal areas occupy each about three-
eighths.
    During    each era of the earth's history, the borders            of some lands
have sunk beneath the sea and been covered                  by marine sediments;
while in other       parts   the terrigenous      deposits     have   been   elevated
into dry land, and have carried with them               a record   of the organisms
which ilourished in the         sea  of the time.       In this transitional      area
there has been throughout a continuity               of geological    and biological
phenomena.
    From these considerations it will be evident that the character                  of
a deposit   is determined much more            by distance from the shore of          a
continent than by actual depth; and the same would appear to be the
case   with respect to the fauna spread           over    the floor of the present
oceans.     Dredgings near the shores of continents, in depths of 1000,
2000, or 3000       fathoms,    are   more   productive both in species and
individuals than dredgings at similar depths several hundred miles
seawards.       Again, among the few species dredged in the abysmal
areas    furthest    removed      from     land,   the    majority    show archaic
characters,    or belong to groups which          have     a   wide distribution in
time as well as over       the floor of the present        oceans.    Such are the

                        of Edinburgh,       Session   1883-84                      529
 Hexactinellida,      Brachiopoda,       Stalked Crinoids and other Echino-
 derms,   &c.
    As  already    mentioned,      the   transitional area is that which now
shows the      greatest     variety in respect to biological and physical
conditions, and in past time it has been subject to the most frequent
and    the    greatest     amount      of change.      Tho animals       now living
in this   area may bo regarded as the greatly             modified   descendants     of
those which have lived in similar regions in past geological                 ages, and
some of whose ancestors           have     been   preservod    in the sedimentary
rocks   as fossils.     On the other hand, many of tho animals dredged
in  the abysmal        regions   are most probably also the descendants              of
animals which lived in the shallower waters                   of former    geological
periods,    but     descended       into deep      water   to   escape    the   severo
struggle for existence which must always                 have    obtained    in those
depths affected by light, heat, motion, and other conditions.                  Having
found    existence      possible   in the less favourable        and   deeper water,
they   may be regarded as having slowly spread themselves                     over the
floor of the      ocean,     but without undergoing            great  modifications,
owing to the      extreme uniformity of the conditions and the absence
of  competition.        Or we may suppose that in the depressions which
have    taken    place    near   coasts, some species       have    been    gradually
carried down to deep water, have accommodated                     themselves    to the
new conditions, and have gradually migrated to the regions far from
land.     A  few species may thus have migrated            to tho deep sea during
each   geological     period.     In  this way the origin and distribution of
the deep-sea fauna in the present oceans may in some measure be
explained.       In like   manner, the pelagic fauna and flora of the ocean
is most probably derived originally from tho shore and shallow water.
During     each period of the earth's         history  a few animals     and plants
have been carried to       sea, and have     ultimately adopted      a pelagic   mode
of life.
    Without     insisting strongly on the correctness             of some of these
deductions and conclusions,            we present them        for the consideration
of naturalists     and goologists,      as the result   of a long, careful,     but as
yet incomplete,      investigation.

4. Note on a large Crystal of Calc-spar, found in Lough Corrib
             by Professor      Tait.    By the Abbe Eenard.
   The crystal of calcite found by Professor Tait presents very large
dimensions    for  a specimen,   with very simple, and, at the same time,
very definite   forms.     This crystal shows the faces of the primitive
rhombohedron of 105°, and is twinned with parallel axes.               The two
individuals which compose the crystal show the form of the cleavage
rhombohedron      R (1011)    ; they  are applied     to each other with sym
metrical   development       with reference    to the base oR (0001), and
present the appearanco of a simple         crystal,   although formed of two
distinct halves, of which the upper belongs to one crystal and the
lower to the other, the two individuals being complementary              to each
other.    Along the twinning plane may be noticed a series of very
regular grooves, which indicate a repetition        of the twinning following
the base.    It   must   be noticed   that the six faces do not present the
same physical characters       — two of   them, the     primitive faces of the
crystal, are smooth ; the other four, although having the same crystal-
lographic sign, are faces of cleavage more brilliant than the others.
They appear to show that the crystal, although found isolated                 by
Professor Tait, was        formerly attached.        This is further demon
strated by the presence of irregular faces, which are not amenable to
any    mathematical     law.    These   false   faces   may   be  seen on    the
superior  and inferior portions of the crystal ; they are granular,          and
without lustre, and cannot        be confounded       either with the crystal
faces or with those of cleavage.         They have been produced          by the
pressure exerted upon the crystal by tho neighbouring crystals, which
were developing      at the same time.      This consideration    explains the
anomalies   which they show, when regarded from            a geometrical   point
of view.

                 1,  On Radiation.         By Professor Tait.
                                   (Abstract.)
    The first part of this communication      was devoted to a recapitulation
 of the advances in the Theory of Exchanges              made by Stewart in
  1858, and published in the Transactions            of the   Society for that
 year.    Such    a recapitulation     it will    bo  seen   is   nec&ssary;    as
 Stewart's   papers   6eem   either to have    fallen into oblivion or to be
 deemed     unworthy     of notice.     It  was   pointed out      that Stewart
 showed    in  these   papers   that the radiation within        an   impervious
 enclosure   containing no source of heat must ultimately become, like
 tho pressure    of a non-gravitating fluid at rest, the same at all points
 and in all directions ; but that this sameness is not, like that of fluid
 pressure, one of mere total amount ; it extends to the quantity and
 quality of every one of the infinite series of wave-lengths involved.
 For, as one or more of the bodies may bo black, the radiation is
 simply that of     a  black body at the temperature          of the enclosure
 Any new      body, at the proper     temperature,    may be inserted      in the
 enclosure without altering this state of things; and must therefore
 emit precisely the amount and quality which it absorba                      This
 remark contains all that is yet known on the subject.                    For we
 have only to    assume   for the  purpose   of reasoning,   the  existence   of a
substance     partially, or wholly, opaque to one definite wave-length,
and perfectly transparent to all others ; or with any other limited
properties we choose ; and suppose it to be put (at the proper
temperature^      into   the   enclosure.    If   we   next assume       that its
temperature when put in differs from that of the enclosure, the ex
perimental fact that, in time, equilibrium of temperature
                                                                       is arrived
at, shows that the radiation of any particular wave-length by a body
increases with rise of temperature.         And so forth.

   Sl»lrtralanaly$e, am         Dr II. Kayser (Berlin, 1883), though historical
   details are freely given, the name of Stewart does not occur even
   once  !   There are in the same work other instances                      of historical
   error nearly     as grave.       Thus    the physical    analogy,    hy which Stokes
   in 1852 first explained the basis of spectrum analysis, is given in
   L)r Kayser's work       ;  but it is introduced by the very peculiar phrase
   "              wollcn wir versuchen, eine              mechanhche      ErMdrumj tier

  even mentioned         in connection with it          !
      The second part of the paper deals with the question of the limits
  of accuracy of the reasoning             which led Stewart, and those who have
  followed     him,     to results      of such vast importance. Dr Kaysvr,

  the mere     fact that phosphorescent bodies, such                as  luminous     paint,
 give out visible radiations while at ordinary temperatures,                      shows at
 mice that there are grave             exceptions even to the fundamental state
  ment that the utmost radiation, both as to quantity and as to quality,
 at any one temperature,             is that of a black body        : — and very simple
 considerations show that all the reasoning which has been applied
 to the subject is ultimately based on the Second                  Law of Thermody
 namics     (or Carnot's principle), and is therefore            true only in the sense
 in which that law is true, i.e, in the statistical sense.                  The assumed
 ultimate      uniformity        of    temperature in an enclosure, which                 is
 practically the basis of every demonstration of the extended law of
 exchanges,      is merely an expression for the average                 of irregularities
 which are in the majority of cases too regularly spread, and on a
 scale too minute, to be detected               by our senses, even when these arc
 aided     by the most delicate instruments.                  The     kinetic   theory of
gases here       furnishes us with something much closer than a mere
analogy.        For the very           essence     of what appears       to us uniform
temperature        in a gas is the regularity of distribution              of  the irregu
larities of speed of the various particles.                   And, just      as  in  every
mass of gas there are a            few particles moving with speed far greater
than that of mean square,             so it  is at least probable that a black body
at    ordinary      temperatures        emits      (though,  of   course,     excessively
feebly) radiations of wave-lengths corresponding to those of visible

   have been obtained        by various experimenters.

  on the    kinetic theory, but such that none of the particles could have

  there    were   still  a tendency      to the   nearest   statistical average, wo

  2.   On the Need for Decimal Subdivisions in Astronomy and
          Navigation,        and      on    Tables    requisite      therefor.     By
          Edward Sang, LL.D.
      The abstract question        as  to what number would have been most
 advantageously         taken for the basis of an arithmetical system has
 been put aside by the universal preference                shown for the number
 ten.      All nations having any culture count in tens. In the English
 language, traces remain of the old numeration by dozens and scores ¦
 the French        still  prefer    to   say
                                               " quatre-vingt   seize,"  rather than
 " nonante-six."         These               serve to show     that there has been
                                  vestiges
 change.       But   from   the old Eastern languages        all traces of any but
 the denary countiug have disappeared.
     It  is in vain to argue that the number twelve is divisible by three
and by four, or that the perfect number six has the preference ; for,
 however      strong the arguments          may be, there is no likelihood that
they      shall overturn the         universally adopted      mode.      Nay, when,
purely      as arithmeticians,        we   come to look into        the matter,   and
consider      the needs and capabilities of mankind, we find arguments
of no mean weight in favour of the denary mode.
     But, whatever question           there   may   be about    the convenience     of
one or of another          basis, there can be no question       as to the  principle
of uniformity          in the plan.       To count our money          in dozens and
scores, our weights          in sevens, and our distances          in elevens, must
necessarily entail trouble and confusion.                 Our unreasoning      adher
ence to       the medley of British         monies,   weights, and measures, is
indeed a subject          of wonder.       If  there  be fourteen     pounds to the
stone,      why not fourteen         ounces    to the pound 1       Five and   a half
yards go to a perch, why not five perches and a half to the furlong 1

 We make our pound of seven thousand troy grains, and come                        down

    The introduction of the Indian numerals and notation has brought
 the inconvenience         of these haphazard        schemes    into strong      relief.
 The whole       power of this algorithm comes from its uniformity.
 The old scheme           of counting by help of letters            had    proceeded
 decimally, its great convenience           having led to its use among             the
 Arabs, from whom it passed into Greece.                In this scheme the value
 of the letters depends on their place in the Hebrew Elif Be, which
 place is fixed in the Arab's memory            by the rhythm
                                                                     " ebjed hewes
hota   kelnien,"       &c, while the Greeks had to supply two new
characters    to  fit it to their alphabet.        The first group of nine letters
are taken      to signify units, the       second     group tens, and the third
group hundreds.           But tho marks,       in   the  Indian    method,    rise    in
value ten times for each step on the scale, and thus ten characters
serve, and much more than serve, for the former twenty-eight
    We, who have never had to use the older method,                      can hardly
appreciate    the magnitude        of the improvement         Adopted at     once by
men of science,       it led   to the decimal    division   of the radius, and to
the construction of the canon of sines in its modern               form.     Passing
to commercial        men,    it greatly facilitated their      computations.         In
every   branch of business its influence is felt                 Thus Fahrenheit
when arranging his thermometers,            divided the capacity of the bottle
decimally, and estimated           temperature     by the expansion of mercury
in ten-thousandth         parts    of its bulk   ;  while Celsius, proceeding          in
another    direction, placed one hundred degrees between the tempera
tures of freezing      and boiling water.       The chemist makes his analyses
in hundredths       ; the  banker discounts per cent.       ; in every quarter the
struggle   is in favour of decimals.         Gunter contrived his chain of          one
hundred links in order that there might be one hundred thousand
square   links in     an acre ; the engineer        graduates   his levelling staff
not in feet, inches, and oighths, but in feet and hundredths.
    There is no doing without decimals j when, in making a propor
tion, we have to compare two quantities of one kind, we, as the
arithmeticians say, bring them both to one denomination                  : 2   cwt       S
qrs. 17 lbs. 11     J  oz. must     be brought to quarter       ounces,   of which
there are 20 845        in this quantity.       That is to say, having         found
our old system to bo unworkable, we have recourse                  to counting         in

  tens ; and, moreover, the trouble of converting our confused measures
  into decimals     exceeds       that of the real business           in hand.      Every
  such conversion     is a protest in favour of uniformity.
     Of all   the affairs     to which     calculation is applied,          trigonometry
 and astronomy        have      reaped    most   copiously the benefits            of tho
 Indian algorithm.           We    havo only to compare the laborious process
 by which Archimedes determined                the ratio of the circumference            to
 the diameter of     a   circle, or the parallax and distance of the moon,
 to perceive    how effectively       the  new numerals         smoothed       the  rough
 road of alpha, beta       ; iota, kappa.      Yet, great     as these benefits      were,
 they failed to satisfy the growing needs of science.                      Each step in
exactitude added to the toil of the computer,                    till,  discouraged     by
the swelling crowd of multiplications              and    divisions, of proportions
among the sines and cosines, the                 mean     distances,      eccentricities,
anomalies, and periodic times, Kepler began to despair of the future
of his    science.     Can we, then, afford         to mar       these benefits       by a
slavish adherence to a scheme of subdivision, beautiful in its uni
formity, dignified by its age, but inept to the actual requirements                     1
    The   successive     division by sixty, into parts of the first, second,
and third degree of minuteness,             dates back from before the reach of
authentic history      ;  it speaks of a great advance and subsequent               decay
of knowledge, for the ancient stadium and the Chinese li                            agree,
within an inch or two, with the third subdivision of the                           earth's
circumference in this progression.              The convenience           of its numer
ous divisions has, no doubt, helped             to retain    it in   use.     Sixty  com
bines, in this respect, the advantages of ten and twelve, but is far
too large for numeration           in the ordinary affairs of life.            Its  reten
tion in tho measurement of time and               angle    is a great hindrance to
our progress.
    In  the exceedingly        simple    applications of trigonometry to land-
measuring, we have very little to do even with the addition and
subtraction of angles, nothing whatever with their ratios                     ; and  thus
the   character    of the subdivision has, comparatively,                 little import
ance for the surveyor.             Yet even     he would       be    much helped by
the   centesimal     division of the quadrant.           It   is  a   long time since
the division of        the azimuth circle        into four quadrants            of ninety
degrees each was discarded ; the bearings              were     then     read, so many
degrees    to   the   east or west        of north,    so    many      degreos east or

different      directions.           The awkwardness of this is obvious to us                                   ;
division into two parts of 180° each was substituted, and this                                       again
is now superseded               by the graduation all round to 360°, so that                                   a
number applies              to one direction only ; this gives great clearness                             to
the     field operations.             Having       observed,          from the station A,                the
bearings      of various signals, among                   others        that    of the       station      B,
and having carried the theodolite thither, we wish so to plant it                                         as
that it may again indicate the bearings of other signals.                                        For this
purpose we so place the                azimuth circle as that, on looking back                            to
A, the      reading      may be exactly the opposite                       of the previous        reading
from    A     to B.      As     the seamen phrase              it,   we must     box the compass;
wc have to add or subtract                  180° as the case may be.
   In    computing the co-ordinates                   of the stations,                by help of         the
traverse      table, or by the logarithmic process, we have                                 to note the
change      from addition to subtraction at 90°, 180°, 270°, 360°,                                      and
have to pass from the top to the                     bottom of the page at 45',                      135",
225°,    and        315°;      changing sine into cosine, difference                        of latitude
into departure.                Whereas, with             the       centesimal         division     of    the
quadrant,       the changes          are at the          hundreds and fifties, while                     the
opposite       directions differ by 200°.                       The        improvement both               in
comfort and in freedom from mistakes needs not to be insisted on.
   In   astronomical           work, the awkwardness of having two numerical
systems       is   conspicuous.         We     observe         a     planet's   opposition to            the
sun, and again another opposition                   ;    the interval of time               is   noted    in
days, hours,          minutes,       seconds   ;   the    change           of longitude in signs,
degrees,      minutes,         seconds; and thence,                   roughly, to compute                the
periodic time            we have       to   make    a    proportion.             If    we    had     been
habituated to count in sixties, and                        if        the     number 24           had not
occurred,       the      calculation iu sexagesimals                       would have         been       the
natural       one;       our logarithms            would, according               to Nepair's own
opinion, have had 60 for their basis,                            just as now they have                   10.
As things          are, no one can make the calculation.                        We must turn             the
times and the angles into decimals,                      taking the day or the second                     as
the unit of time, the degree perhaps or the second as that of angle                                       :
without decimals              we are unable to move              a    single step.
  Now these            divisions are made for the purposes                            of calculation      ;
intrinsically       it   is   of no moment which way we count,                          the planetary

phenomena are not thereby                          affected ; the matter        is one purely of
arithmetical          convenience.                Had the subdivisions been according               to
the powers of ten, these conversions                             and    their attendant labour
would have been saved.                        But it is not now and then only that
these irksome conversions                    occur ; they pervade          every calculation in
geodesy,          navigation,     astronomy.             The estimate is not too high, that
they double the labour of computation.
     In    astronomical works there is abundant evidence of the need for
a change.            "While     the    reckouing of longitude in signs, used sixty
years      ago,      is discarded        in favour of the counting in degrees all
round, thirds are quite disused,                         the second     is divided into tenths
and       hundredths.           Tho arguments              for tho planetary disturbances
are given, not in degrees, but in thousandth parts                              of the entire re
volution.
     There is no work having greater authority in these matters than
that most admirable                   one,    the Nautical        Almanac, and every page
thereof proclaims the need for decimals.                          The right ascensions, decli
nations, latitudes, and longitudes are given to decimals                             of tho second.
Now,       if     the division     of the second into 100 parts                  bo better       than
into      60,     why should wo not adopt,                  as   John Newton did in               tho
Trigonomelria Britannica,                     tho centesimal           division of tho degree        ?
There       is,   and there can be, no argument                       in favour of division by
60 down to seconds, that                     will not hold       as    well for thirds and for
fourths    ;      and the same instinct for convenience                     which leads to tho
decimal division of the second would,                                   had its own way, lead
                                                             if
                                                             it
to that of the degree, of the quadrant,                      and of the day.
     But ease of calculation                 is   not the only consideration.            Tho sun's
daily right-ascensions,               to hundredths of           a    second, aro accompanied
by   a    column of variations in ono hour                  ;    this, which    is   really needed
for the sake of the inept computer,                       saves tho division by 24.              But
this column occupies the place of tho actual                            differences,    needed by
the strict computer               for taking into account                 the   variation of tho
variation*           With       decimal       graduation     one column would suffice for
all, and the compiler of the almanac                         would bo spared the labour.
Tho same may be said of the sun's declinations and of the moon's
hourly          places, which are accompanied                by variations in 10 minutes.
In     the last-mentioned             there    is   a   remarkably strong instanco             of tho
awkwardness            of sixties.        Thus the variation in declination               is   to bo

Lunar     Distances, is      a protest    even    stronger; therein the          moon's
distances     from    a  star   are given at intervals of three             hours.      In
order    to   compute      the   Greenwich       time   of his observation,            the
mariner compares his observed distance (corrected for refraction and
parallax) with those found in the almanac ; he has therefore to
make a proportion in sexagesimals.                 Seamen      are understood      to be
so   wedded      to  the present     system,    that they of all others would
dislike   a change ; yet      such are the      torments     of sexagesimals        that,
for the shunning of them,          a   column of proportional logarithms                 is
contrived, and a special logarithmic system is arranged.                     Instead of
having to work out a simple proportion, the                    seaman     is drilled to
use the proportional logarithm, whose                nature,    in ninety-nine     cases
out of a hundred, he does not comprehend.
   In   the higher branches        of astronomical calculations, and in the
application of trigonometry to mechanical                 and physical problems,
the arcs and their various functions have to be compared,                     the mode
of comparison       being suited    to the particular cases.          When the arcs
are homologues       of angles measured by help of graduated instruments,
their natural unit is the entire          circumference      ;   but their sines and
tangents,     having reference       to   rectilineal measure,         are   most    con
veniently compared          with the radius.        Hence it is that, in ordinary
trigonometry, two units are employed; and hence                         also   the con
venient though somewhat              illogical    expression,
                                                                   " the   sine   of an
angle,"    instead of     " the sine    of the arc homologous            to an angle."
But in many       caBes,  notably in analytical investigations, the radius
of the circle is made the basis of comparison               both for arcs and for
sines.     Also, in computing the anomalies             of the planets, the areas
passed over by the radius-vector            have    to be considered,         and   it   is
much preferable       to measure the sines        in parts of the circumference,
the areas in parts of the surface of the circle.
   Thus we have often to pass from one unit of measure to another                          ;
with no system of subdivision can the transitions                     be made      more
easily  (if  at all) than by that of uniform decimal subdivision.
   From whichever point of view the matter may be studied,                            the
desirability of the change is clear         ;  but there are difficulties in the

                     of Edinburgh,       Session 1883-84.                               539
way ; there are the prejudices         of habit, the discomforts of transition,
the existing mass of preparatory          work suited to the old plan, and,
above all, the mass of preparations                needed      for the new scheme,
Here, indeed, the great obstacle lies.
     Aside from the proposal of a change of system, a new computa
tion of fundamental tables looms in the near future.                    The precision
of modern measurements         render    it   necessary, in astronomical         specula
tions, to reckon to hundredths of a second of time, to tenths of a
second    of arc.    Now when         we determine         an arc by help of (say)
the seven-place     logarithm of its tangent            true   in the last figure,, the
uncertainty arising from the            omitted parts           may    amount to the
fortieth part of a second j so that, since                  the    logarithm itself is
subject    to several similar uncertainties,           we may, notwithstanding all
care,   err by the tenth part of a second.               But it is a sound principles
that the accuracy of the arithmetical work should be clearly beyond
that of observation,       in order that no perceptible             new error may be
introduced, and thus the time is not very far distant when eight-
place tables may be indispensable.              Hence,     in designing the canons
for the decimal system,         we    must      also    look forward to increased
precision.
     Since by far the greater number of computations                  are done by help
of logarithms, our first business            is to see to the logarithmic canon.
Beginning independently of all previous                   work, the logarithms of
all primes up to 10,000          have    been      computed        to 28 places,      that
they may be true          to 25, each prime being              put in relation to, at
least, three    others.     The greatest discrepancy              found amounted         to
unit in the 27th place,          so   that this fundamental table                 may    be
regarded as altogether free           from error.        The volumes       I.,   II., III.,
placed    on the Society's    table, contain all the articulate steps of the
work, with indices to the primes              and to the divisors used      ;     so that,
if   in any subsequent        computation one of these divisors                    should
recur, we are spared        the labour of      a   new division.         Thus for the
logarithm of 6563, the three equalities                were used
                    32 130 000 001       -    11-599 743-6563
                       627 600 001       =      7-19 719-6563
                          36 930 001     = 17-331-6563
 and the agreement furnished presumptive evidenco                      of the accuracy

 540                  Proceedings       of the Royal       Society
 of the previous computations (themselves              similarly checked) for the
 above eight    primes    11, 599,    742;    7, 19, 719;        7, 331, and also for
 the prime divisors of 3213, 6276, 3693, namely,                   17, 523, 1231.      In
 this way the whole work is bound together                     by an intimate inter
 lacing of tests.    The search for the appropriate formula? was greatly
 facilitated by Burckhardt's admirable " Table des Diviseurs,"                        but
 the recent extensions      of that table by Dase and by tilaisher would
 have been most welcome.
    By the combination          of these primes         and by interpolation           to
 second differences,    the logarithms, to 15 places, of all numbers from
 100 000    to 370 000      have been computed.             The actual calculations
 are contained    in the twenty-Beven        volumes      herewith presented,        and
 the transfers   in nine.
    These   logarithms are necessarily          liable to residual errors, whose
amount,    however,    cannot    exceed    three     units in the fifteenth place.
Among     a large  number of verifications, made for other purposes,                  no
error exceeding     two units has been found.
    They    are  accompanied       by the      first and       second    differences  —
differences    of the third order would only appear in the sixteenth
place even at the beginning of the canon.
    By help of these differences we can interpolate the logarithm of                    a
number of more than six effective             figures ; the       work consisting of
three multiplications.       For   the converse operation,         that of computing
the number corresponding          to a logarithm not found in the table, we
need to resolve an equation of the second                 degree.      Now the first
differences   have ten, the second difference          have Jive effective      figures,
and therefore,     when the utmost precision          is required,     either of these
interpolations is necessarily       laborious.
    For  the  purposes of shortening the             work, and of avoiding           the
solution of the quadratic       equation,    the expedient        used   by Nepair in
the computation of his original canon               tniri Jiciis, is had recourse
in  a  form modified to suit the present circumstances.
    To get the logarithm of a number not in the table, it is enough to
discover    that of the ratio which it bears to the tabulated number
immediately below         it    Now     this ratio itself is easily found             by
division, and, in our present       case, is expressed      by unit followed at an
interval of at least five blanks, by other figures           ;  its greatest possible
value is 1,00001.         In   the    volume      marked      Auxiliary taUc         the

                      of Edinburgh,       Session    1883-84.                     541
 logarithms    of such ratios are given for each of the ten thousand
 numbers    from   1 000 000 000 to      1 000   010 000.     This list serves the
 purposes of both of Nepair's       Tabulae,  prima    et seamda,     and gives us,
 by help of this       easy division,     the fifteen-place     logarithm of any
 number     whatever.      Not only     so;  it  also enables     us to solve     the
 converse problem,      by help of a multiplication        as easy.
    But we may approach to the required result, from the tabulated
 numbers     immediately abovo.        So, in order to supply tho moans of
verification, the auxiliary table is carried, on tho other side, to ten
thousand     numbers    below the same 1 000 000 000.
   This addition to the canon, besides greatly lessening tho labour in
interpolating, lends itself readily to systematic           computation.
   The fundamental canon for trigonometry is that of sines                    : those
to 25 places      for each two thousandth part of the quadrant,                   and
to 15 places      for each ten thousandth part, have              been computed
strictly by second differences,        verified at short intervals.           In  the
volumes     placed   before   the  Society the actual calculations are con
tained : they are recorded        in such     a form    that each sine may bo
instantly    examined.      The    manner      of tho calculation        afforded   a
continuous and complete          check,    and the table is believed           not to
contain a single error.        From these, the canon of logarithmic sines
and the other usual trigonometrical tables may easily be compiled                  to
an  exactitude far beyond the requirements            of practice.
   In a paper    entitled "Nouveau Calcul des Mouvements elliptiqnes,"
printed in the Memoirs of the Turin Academy for 1879, the mean
anomaly of a planet is deduced from its position by taking the sum
or the difference      of two circular segments.          In   order   to reap tho
advantage     of this exceedingly     simple solution of Kepler's problem,
we need first to compute         the sines,     measured, not in parts of tho
radius,   but in parts     of the circumference            The volume       marked
" Sines measured in                "
                          Degrees    contains     the whole calculation of this
canon for each centesimal        minute, and to ten decimal          places of the
quadrant.
   From this table, that of circular segments, measured in degrees of
the surface     of the circlo, for each of tho 40 000 minutes of tho
entire   circumference,     has   been     composed.        This   table,    though
designed expressly      for astronomical      purposes,   has its uses in other
branches of science.

 542                  Proceedings      of the Royal    Society
    When     the position of a planet         in its orbit is given,     the mean
 anomaly is obtained         directly and almost      by inspection   ;  but when
 the mean anomaly         is proposed,    the position has to be got by the
 inverse use of the tables, that is by approximation.            When the first
estimate is reasonably        near, the work is scarcely more laborious than
an ordinary interpolation ; and when, as in preparing the equations
of   the centre, the computations are to be made at stated                intervals,
the labour is insignificant.
    For   the purpose of guiding the first estimate           in sporadic     cases,
the mean anomalies         corresponding    to each degree of position, and       in
orbits of every degree of eccentricity, are given in the volume                  A,
titled Mean Anomalies, the results being given to ten decimal places,
and in volume B to eight places, with differences and variations.
    In Kepler's     time the details     of only six elliptic orbits needed to
be worked out ; now we have forty times as many.                 The motions of
the    cloud of specks,      so small as to be seen only by help of the
telescope,    afford   an   opportunity of verifying        and   correcting    our
estimates of the relative masses of the major planets,              so much the
more     valuable that the disturbances           exerted   by these miniature
worlds upon their giant neighbours escape our power of detection.
This new mode of calculation vastly reduces the labour of comparing
the purely elliptic with the observed motions.
    For all analytical investigations       the arc, as well as its sine, cosine,
and tangent,     is reckoned in parts of the radius — an arrangement            also
suited    for several other applications of trigonometry.               From this
point of view, the sine and cosine take their place among functions
with recurring derivatives         ; they are most easily and rapidly com
puted    in this   connection,   without referenco to the properties         of tha
circle, being regarded       as functions equal to their second derivatives
                                 The volume titled " Recurring Functions

part of the radius, up to two radii.
    For facilitating    the change from the one unit to the other in            the
measurement       of arcs, a table is here presented        of the " Lengths      of
                  "
Circular Arcs        both for the ancient and for the modern graduation.
The contrast in the arrangement of the two parts of this table affords
an excellent      example of the power and conciseness of the decimal
system.

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                       543
    The lengths are given for each second of the ancient division up
to one degree,      in all 3600 values            ;   thereafter for each degree up to
1800°, or five complete            revolutions; the values for fractions of                    a
second     being    got     by the     transposition          of the numbers          at    the
beginning of the table, this facility being due to the adoption of
the decimal       division for     seconds.
    For the modern division 1000 terms                       suffice,   because      by mere
transposition the table may be extended indefinitely both ways.
    In order to     pass from the one system of               subdivision of the quad
rant to the other, a table of equivalent                  modern and ancient degrees
is given, first from 10c to 10° or 9° to 9°;                          then for centesimal
minutes up to 10° (computed for the sake of verification);                           next for
each tenth      decimal second up to the same limit                      ;   and, lastly,    for
each hundredth         part of a second up to ten seconds.                     By this table
the conversion         of ancient into modern or of modern into ancient
degrees    is easily   effected.
    Similar tables for the conversion of ancient and decimal time                            are
exhibited.
    In the   reduction of astronomical observations we have very often
to exchange solar and sidereal time.                    In   1868 the writer published
Time Conversion           Tables for each tenth second of the whole day.
The counterpart to these is herewith presented                    ;   it is continued from
day to day up to          1 000   days ;   and this      suffices for minutes, seconds,
and fractions by simple transposition.
   Lastly, there is appended a Traverse Table, for plain and mean
latitude sailing, for each of the 400 degrees of azimuth and for dis
tances    up to    100.
    These form       at least a beginning               in the collection of requisite
decimal tables.     That which is first wanted beyond them is the
canon of logarithmic sines.     The preparation of this canon would
be greatly facilitated by the extension of the fifteen-place logarithms
up to the whole million — that              is,   for all six-figure numbers.           Those
of them already prepared need the aid of the auxiliary multipliers
2 and    had they been carried to the half million, the auxiliary
         3
         ;                                                                                    2
would have sufficed.
    In   conclusion,      it   may be remarked that five and seven place
tables arc exact enough for almost all business purposes                         ;   but that,
in order     to have these true to the last figure, the original                 calculations

 544                  Proceedings      of the Royal      Society
 must be carried several steps beyond           ;  also, that while it is easy to
 abridge the lengthy results, it is impossible             to extend those which
 have proved too short; then the work                  must be re-done from the
 beginning.      Hence the great advantage already experienced in this               :
 that Brigg's computations to fourteen             places served   for the prepara
 tion of Vlacq's ten-place table, and that again for those in common
use, of seven and of five places.
An Electro-Magnetic              Declinometer.            By    A.     Tanakadate,
         Assistant to the Professor of Physics in the University
         of Tokio, Japan.         Communicated by Prof. J. A. Ewing,
         University College, Dundee.
    The terrestrial magnetic field will in general           be disturbed     in the
neighbourhood       of an electric circuit   ;    but  if the circuit be     a plane
set at   right angles to the terrestrial lines of force, tho direction of
the field will remain unchanged at all points in the plane of the
circuit.      To determine the magnetic meridian,               we    have only to
place   a  plane circuit in such a direction that, when a current in the
circuit is started and stopped, no change takes place in the position
of  a  small magnet hung at a point          in the plane of the circuit, and
free to turn in azimuth.            The plane of the circuit will then lie
magnetically east and west.
    The following method of laying down the magnetic meridian on,
say, a laboratory     table,  will  be found      very convenient      and accurate
in practice    :—
    A light    rectangular wooden frame is made, about               1  meter long,
15    cm.   high, and 3 cm. wide, and its outer               surface    is recessed
slightly, except at the      edges, to receive 200 turns         of fine insulated
wire, which are wound regularly round the frame.                     Both ends     of
tho coil are led off from           tho same point, and closo together,            in
order to limit the electro-magnetic            influence of the circuit to the
portion     wound    on the frame.       The circuit is completed at          a con
siderable distance from the frame through a battery, reversing                  key,
and box of resistance coils.
    A  small magnetometer, consisting             of the mirror (with attached
magnets) of      a  Thomson's    dead-beat galvanometer, huug in a wood
and glass case by a silk fibre 5 cm. long, is placed in the centre                 of
this frame, resting upon       a littlo shelf which projects into tho middle

  of the frame from an outside stand, so that the frame can be moved
  round or taken out of its place without disturbing                    the magneto
  meter.     The displacement of the mirror is observed,                 as  usual, by
  the    motion   of the reflected imago of an illuminated               slit or wire.
  The whole is shown in fig.          1.
     To determine the magnetic meridian             —
     1.   Place the frame in a vertical plane, with tho magnetometer nt
 its centre,    and its length         approximately      at right     angles   to the
 magnetic meridian.
     2. Observe      the position      of the reflected     image   on the magneto
 meter scale before closing the          circuit
    3.    Make the circuit       so that tho field due to      it has the same sign
 as   the terrestrial     field.     The image will in general          be displaced,
 and    its movements will       be quickened      on account of tho increase of
 directive force.        Turn the frame until tho image           comes back to     its
 original position.
    4. Eeverse      the current; unless the adjustment               in operation     3
 has been correct, the image            will again    be displaced.      The current
 is to be regulated       (by the resistance coil) to prevent the equilibrium
from being unstable or too nearly neutral.                 Turn the frame, if need
 be, until tho image comes to its original position.                    Now draw a
lino on the table, using one edge of the frame as                 a straight-edge, or
in   some other way note         its position.
    5.    Break the current       ; remove the frame and replace          it inverted,
and with its former east end now pointing west.                    Repeat operations
 1  to 4 in this         position,    and   take    for the magnetic        E-W    tho
mean      of the two directions       so determined.
    If   the edges of the frame are not strictly at right angles to tho
lines of force at its centre, but are inclined at an angle of                 % + o to
them, the two determinations             will differ by    2a, and their mean      will
be independent         of a, provided      the edges of the framo are strictly
parallel,     and     the   magnetic      declination    is   constant    during the
operation.
    Experiments with the           above apparatus have shown that the error
due to any small excentricity            on the part of the magnetometer is
inappreciable.          The magnetometer was purposely                placed 2 mm.
away from the centre towards                different   quarters, but     no sensible

      A much      more elaborate instrument,            based    on the same principle,
  has been       constructed       for the accurate measurement of magnetic
  declination.        In  it the coil is wound in two parts on a bronze frame
  (the form      of which will        be described      below), of much smaller size
  than    in the simple laboratory apparatus already described.                          The
  frame    has hollow pivots, and is mounted on the Y's of an altazi
 muth instrument.             Fig.   2 is taken from      a   photograph of the instru
 ment        The pivots      are made     as nearly as possible of the same size
 as those     of   the telescope      which    belongs to the instrument, and the
 total weight        of the frame nearly equals that of the             telescope.
     A light mirror magnetometer stands between the two parts of the
 coil in the centre of the instrument,                 and is supported        by an inde
 pendent      tripod, as in fig. 2, or by         a  central pillar fixed to the base.
 At the middle of two sides of                the frame narrow slits, a a, are pro
 vided, through which             the edge of the magnetometer mirror is to be
 sighted to bring it to         a  central position.        It  is centred with respect
 to the    other horizontal         and the vertical        direction    by sighting      the
 face of the mirror through one of the hollow pivots, and making the
clearance      equal all round.
     The    magnetometer          is shown       separately in fig.       3.   The mirror
 with attached          magnets is suspended by             a  single   silk-fibre    40 cm.
long.       The upper end of the fibre is tied round                     the middle of       a
small rod         of horn, whose weight             is nearly equal        to that of the
mirror and magnets.                This rod     rests   on two small         V hooks     pro
jecting down from the top of the magnetometer case.                             The hooks
are united at the top, and              can  be turned or lowered by loosening a
jam-nut.         At the lower part of the magnetometer case a thin lens
is   fixed in frout of the mirror.               A little way above the mirror, a
catch, consisting of a pair of inverted hooks, is fixed                    in the   case, so
that when          the magnetometer          is turned       upside down, the mirror
will     be   held     by    the    catch, and       the   horn    rod will     hang free.
This rod is then allowed to turn under the torsion of the fibre
untU that is completely removed.                      The  V    hooks are turned into
the same azimuth             as   the   hanging       rod, and the magnetometer             is
then     inverted, that is to say, restored to its normal                     position.    It
now hangs free, and without sensible initial                       torsion,     It   is next

In inverting  the coil, it is lifted from the Y's and    raised vertically,
care being taken not to touch the magnetometer       case.

550                      Proceedings        of  the  Royal Society
to the original and inverted positions of the coil, are to be read on
the azimuth circle.
   To determine the astronomical meridian, the coil and the magneto
meter are to be removed without                  displacing       the base, and the tele
scope mounted.            Any of    the usual methods of observation can then
be applied.
   An alternative construction is                to attach directly to the telescope
a frame   for the coil.          This requires that the tube of              the telescope
be  perforated in its middle              to let in the magnetometer.             The in
strument becomes            somewhat clumsy, but it has the advantage                      of
allowing     the same        pivots to be used            in    both  the magnetic      anil

the displacement      of the image when the current is made.               There is
no difficulty in detecting       an error of 1" in the position of the coil
by the motion of the reflected image.             Evidently this magnification
must not be carried       so far as to make the initial torsion        of the fibre
seriously comparable with the magnetic couple.                The plan described
above of depriving        the fibre    of initial torsion was introduced for
this reason.
    If   the displacement     of the mirror be observed with            a sufficient
degree of optical magnification,         the process of giving sensibility by
reversing     F   may be dispensed      with.     When     F = H,   8 becomes ^0,
and the angular displacement            of the reflected     ray is equal    to the
error in position of the fame.
    The form of frame (with two parallel coils) shown in fig. 2 has
been chosen in order to minimise the error              produced by excentricity
on    the part of the magnetometer.             The proportions of the frame
have been calculated       as  follows :—
    Let o    =»
                ^ length of the frame.
       „   b =  J height         „
       „ Cj = distance of the nearer face of each coil from the centre.
       „ cs = distance of the further face of each coil from the centre.
     Suppose the coil be set with the plane of ab perpendicular to the
 magnetic     meridian.     Take the centre of the frame          as  origin of co
 ordinates.
     As we are only concerned with the direction in azimuth, we shall
 consider excentricity in the horizontal plane only.               From the sym
 metry of figure      there   will  be no error,     so  far as direction is con
 cerned, when the centre of the magnet             is on either axis    NS or EW
 (see next figure).
     Let the centre of the magnet be at               a  point (8a,   8c) from the
 origin.     The angle which the lines of force at (8a,             8c) make    with
 the axis    of NS will be the error due to excentricity.           Call this angle

The former pair,          being symmetrically         placed      with   respect   to the
assumed position of the magnetometer,                will give no deviating        force   ;

namely,      ABc<Z,    A'B'c'o".    Again,     suppose    two vertical planes,         EF

into two pairs, AEF</, A'E'F'd', and EBcF, E'B'c'F; of these
the    former, being placed          symmetrically       with     regard   to  the   mag
netometer, will give no deviating force.

Sc.*     Since    28a and 8c   *    are supposed to be small compared                      with
the height 2b, these shells may be treated as electromagnetic strips.
   The two strips we     are considering, being on opposite                      sides of the
origin, will produce deviating forces with opposite signs. Hence if
the numerical magnitudes of the forces they cause are equal, they
will produce no deviating effect on the magnetometer.
  Now it is evident, if such a magnetic strip be placed due                              east or

positive maximum and the latter on the further side of the negative
maximum, the deviating force on the magnetometer                 will be insensible.
This is illustrated         by fig. 6, where the curve shows the deviating
force caused by       a  strip in various positions along the lino        NS.
   To find the action of        each magnetic    strip —
   Let NS in the annexed figure represent the magnetic meridian.
Let the centre of the magnetic strip be on the line ns, parallel to
N S,and let the magnetometer be placed at m. From the preced

sensible error, project the area perpendicular to the direction of r,

     When the sides of      a    closed polygon are bisected, and the points
 of bisection joined in order,         a   new polygon is formed.                It  has the
 same    number of sides, and the same mean point of its corners, as
 the original polygon.          In what cases is it similar to the original
polygon      ?  In what cases will two, three, or more successive opera
tions of this kind produce (for the first time) a polygon                         similar   to
the    original  one 1

in the special case just mentioned are powers of one quaternion in

power of the quaternion of which the qs are powers, expressing how

this, there are special solutions           for the triangle, and quadrilateral

           5. On    Vortex Motion.         By Professor Tait.
                                  (Abstract.)
   This paper contained       a discussion     of the consequences of         the
assumption of continuity of motion throughout a perfect fluid              ;  oue
of the    bases   of von Helmholtz's grand          investigation,   on which
W. Thomson founded his theory of vortex-atoms.                It is entirely on
the assumed absence of finite slip that von Helmholtz deduces tl it-
action of   a rotating element on any other element of the fluid, and
that Thomson       calculates the action of one vortex-atom          or part of
such an atom on another atom, or on the remainder of itself.                 The
creation of a single vortex-atom, in the sense in which it is defined
by Thomson, involves        action applied    simultaneously     to all parts of
the fluid mass, not to the rotating portion alone.

— "While it would       be easy to give you an idea of the manner               of

naturalists, the bottom of the                   sea.
     But, in the case of a pure mathematician's work there                                   is,    to use
the words of one             of the      greatest       living cultivators of the analytic
art, no such appeal to the immediate                           Utilitarianism         so dear to the
Philistine souL             If, however, the public to whom                        I   can appeal          is
small,    I       feel that        their judgment             is    sure   ;     and, when   I        have
reminded those who represent that public here, of the succession                                           of
papers      which Mr Muir has contributed                             to our Transactions                and
Proceedings,        I      am      confident          that     they      will sanction with an
emphatic approval the decision of the Council of the Eoyal Society
to confer upon            him the Keith Prize.
     One of the most interesting                      branches of analysis             is   the theory
of Continued Fractions.                     The subject        has   a   double interest, because
it   is   connected on the one hand with that most pure of all the
branches          of pure mathematics,             I      mean       the theory of numbers,                a
sanctuary into which the profane foot of even the applied mathe
matician          scarcely enters       ;    and, on the other, with the theory                            of
forms,      for I   need scarcely remind my mathematical                            hearers that the
algorithms of the greatest common measure                                  and of the calculation
of    the convergent to             a    continued           fraction      are   formally identical        ;
and that this algorithm                 is   also that by which                  Sturm deduced the
functions which bear his name, and which play so important                                           a   part
in   the theory          of equation.
     Mr Muir        has pursued the theory of continued                           fractions, and has
obtained some very important results in both its branches.
     In the first paper of the               series     for which the Keith Prize                is      now
awarded           him,     published         in the twenty-seventh                   volume         of our
Transactions, he gives               a   perfectly       general solution            of the problem
of transforming            an infinite series into            a   continued fraction.               Special
cases      of   this transformation              were known before, but no one had
been able to assign                the general form               of the expression until                 Mr
Muir successfully attacked the problem.
 His second paper, in volume xxviii. of                              the Transactions,          is   to my
mind the most noteworthy of the various pieces of work now under
review.           He there takes up          a   number of remarkable transformations
of various series            into the form of continued                        fractions, which were

504                        Proceedings of       the    Royal Society
given        by    the    great    but     prematurely         removed                mathematician
Ei6onstein.         These results of Eisenstein's              were      left by him almost
entirely without demonstration, and their connection                                   among them
selves or     with other known theorems was very obscurely indicated.
So much was this the case, that several mathematicians had endea
voured unsuccessfully to prove the truth or falsity of the results.
    Mr Muir, guided mainly                  by the general ideas gained in                          the
research just mentioned, takes up these                        theorems of Eisenstein's,
and succeeds with apparent ease in not only proving                                     them, but in
showing their relation to each other and to other known results.
    There is yet another of              Mr Muir's papers on the subject of                        con
tinued       fractious which deserves           especial mention                 at this moment.
I   allude to his paper on Continuants,                  in the eighth volume of                    the
Society's         Proceedings.           Passing      over     the    remarkable               general
theorems regarding the special form of determinants called continu
ants,    I   would       especially direct      your    attention        to the remarkable
theorems there arrived at regarding the expression of quadratic surds
by means of continued              fractions.      Mr Muir finds                 a   general expres
sion for any integer whose square root is expressible by means of                                     a
continued         fraction    having      unit numerators and                a       given recurring
cycle of denominators.              And      he finds        the general condition,                that
any given periodic fraction may represent                      a   quadratic surd.
    Another branch of analysis in which Mr Muir has equally distin
guished himself            is the theory of Determinants,                    which        I   may call
the chief handmaiden               of the theory of algebraic forma.                           In this
subject      Mr Muir may          be classed as a worthy follower of our great
countrymen, Sylvester              and Cayley.          I   need only allude at present
to three of the papers              on this subject                The papers in volumes
xxix. and xxx. of the Transactions                          contain      two          most valuable
generalisations   in this theory, viz., Mr Muir's Extension of Laj>-
lace's   Law, and his Theorem of Extensible Minors. These results
aro     characteristic       of   Mr Muir's work, the constant tendency of
which is the attainment of that higher kind of simplicity which
results from greater generalisation.
      Concerning the last paper of the series (not,                      I   am glad to see by
the evidence of the billet for to-night, the last from                               Mr Muir to the

 theorems,    Mr Muir     succeeds    in drawing      together into a compact
whole a series of highly interesting but hitherto isolated results.
    The Council having awarded the Makdougall-Brisbane                    Prize for
the period      1880-82     to Professor    James    Geikie,   for his contribu
tions to the Geology of the North-West of Europe, including his
Paper on the Geology of the Faroes, published in the Transaction*
of the Society, 1880-81, the Chairman presented the prize.
    Lord Maclaren, in explaining the grounds of the award, said
— The Council has awarded the Makdougall-Brisbane                         Prize to
Professor    James Geikie for his contributions          to the geology of the
north-west     of Europe, including his paper on the " Geology of the
Faroes," published in the Transactions of this Society.
    The Society does not need to be informed of Professor Geikie's
contributions to geological literature, because — like the great geolo
gists   of the Scottish school —our professor is able to invest his
scientific   writings with the charm of           a  flowing    and    picturesque
literary style, and his works descriptive           of the Great Ice Age and
of the later Prehistoric     Period, when man appears upon the scene in
the company of the mammoth and cave-bear,                have been perhaps as
widely read     as those of his distinguished       compatriots Charles Lyell,
Hugh. Miller, and Roderick Murchison.
    But it is not only for their descriptive merits that the writings
of our prizeman-elect claim our recognition.               In his   first and per
haps most important work, Professor           Geikie proposed to himself the
task   of exhibiting the      causes  of that most remarkable and indubit
able   phenomenon,      the existence of continuous         traces   of ice-action
 throughout an area which extends laterally over all the elevated land
 of the north-west of Europe, and vertically from the highest moun
 tain peaks to the water lines of our European shores and valleys.
    I will not undertake to        say whether    the bold conception of an
 ice-cap or ice-river   stretching from the Arctic Circle to the alluvial
 plains of England and Germany              originated    in the mind       of our
 distinguished friend, or whether it was suggested            by the discoveries
 in connection with the      ice-cap of another planet whose polar surface
 is said to be already better known to science than that of our own
  world.   But whether the idea of        a northern ice-cap     was or was not

 56G                  Proceedings      of the Royal      Society
 ing collected and marshalled a most imposing array of facts and
 logical   deductions    in support of his theory.            I do not need to
 remind     the Society of the confirmation which his views have
 received from the results of the expedition              of last summer to       the
 interior of Greenland, which          are the more       remarkable    that Baron
 Nordensjold went to Greenland in the design of disproving                        the
 existence of a continental ice-cap in that region, and returned                 con
 vinced of ita existence by the evidence of his own eyes and the
 reports of his explorers.
    Professor   Geikie,   I suppose,    has    not penetrated so far north, but
we know that he has qualified              himself    for the exposition      of  the
history of the Glacial Age by a careful study of all its phenomena,
not only in Scotland, for which his connection with the Geological
Survey     offered peculiar     facilities,    but   also on the Continent of
Europe, and among the islands of the North Atlantic.                      Of   these
studies his published        works, as well        as his   contributions    to   the
transactions of scientific societies, offer ample evidence.              His latest
contribution     is the paper on         the    Faroes,   which   appears    in   the
Transactions     of this Society.       In estimating the importance of that
paper,   it may    be remarked that the geological interest          of  a country
or group of islands, is not to be measured                by their political     and
commercial importance.           In this     paper we find evidence that the
Faroes have been covered by an ice-cap or mer de glace of 1400 feet
in thickness,      entirely  local in its origin.         The fact that     ice has
accumulated to so great       a height in this relatively small area, makes
the geological evidence applicable to the greater and more elevated
ice-masses    of the continent more significant, and perhaps more easy
of reception and comprehension.               I have no   doubt the Society      ¦will
approve of the nomination           of Professor Geikie by the Council for
the Makdougall-Brisbane         Prize.

      In his first paper,* " Notes on British Tunicata,"                  published    in
  1880, a     suggestion is mado as to the cause of the peculiar relations
  of the viscera in the genera Ascidia, dona, and Corella.                      Six new
 species are described, and several           old ones are fully described for the
 first time, and their synonymy cleared up.                  In subsequent papers f
 on   British Ascidians, various other         species are described, and he deals
 with individual variations in the Tunicata,                  traces   changes    in the
 branchial      sac   of Styela grossularia,        showing      the folds    becoming
 obsolete     and almost disappearing^            discusses    the   variations   of the
 dorsal tubercle within the limits of species, and tries to show how
 the various forms are connected.§
     In the last number of the Transactions                 there is a paper on tho
 "Tunicata       of tho Faroe         Channel,"      in which tho anatomy and
histology of Doliolum is treated in great detail.
    The valuable collections made by the " Challenger " Expedition
were placed in Professor Herdman's hands for examination and
description, and the preliminary              notices of these were published in
the Proceedings          of  this Society.        In   the first part of the final
Memoir published in the " Challenger                 "

genera and seventy -four new species are described.
    If   we except the Molgulida?, which Lacaze-Duthiers                   discussed in
1877, Professor         Herdman      was the first to fully define tho families
and sub-families of the Ascidia; Simplices.
    The anatomy and histology of the new and                        more    remarkable
deep-sea      forms     are  described     in  'great   detail,   the description     of
Culeolus      murrayi being probably the most minute and detailed
description of an Ascidian that has ever been published.
    In this     memoir some remarkable structures are for the first time
pointed      out, — 1st,   a system of branched calcareous spicules in tho
vessels of the branchial sac and endostyle ; 2nd, a curious modifica
tion of the blood-vesseb in the               test,  which probably converts tho
outer layer of         the latter     into   a  respiratory organ. Tho family
Clavelinidae is removed from the compound to the simple Ascidians,
and reasons are given for this change in classification, and the Report
concludes with a phylogenetic table.

      In  1881  Julin  and   E van Benedeu proposed the homology of the
  neural gland in the Tunicata            with the vertebrate pituitary     body.
  Professor Herdman has suggested a            modified theory — that the neural
 gland,    its duct,   and the dorsal         tubercle (and therefore also the
 original    pituitary body) were formed             by the conjunction      of   a
 primitive renal organ and        a sense organ.
     Some of Professor Herdman's views have been subjected to con
 siderable criticism      by continental       biologists,  but it is universally
 acknowledged       that his remarkable series of papers on the Tunicata
 are characterised by great        ability, and the Council have accordingly

     There is no distinction known to men among states of existence
of   a  body which can give reason for any one state being regarded as
a state of absolute rest       in space, and any other being regarded as a
state of uniform      rectilinear motion.        Men have no means of know
ing, nor even of imagining, any one length rather than any other,
as being the distance between the place occupied by the centre               of   a
ball at present, and the place           that was occupied by that centre       at
any past instant; nor of knowing or imagining                 any one direction,
rather than any other, as being the direction               of the straight line
from the former place         to the new place,      if the ball is supposed     u>
have been moving in space.            The point of      space that was  occupied
by the centre of the ball at any specified past moment is utterly             l<*st
to us as soon as that moment is past, or as soon as the centre                 has
moved out of that point, having left no trace iccognisablo by us of
its past place in the universe of space.
    There is then an essential difficulty as to our forming           a  distim

 conception either of rest or of rectilinear motion through unmarked
 space.
      We have besides               no preliminary        knowledge       of any principle         of
 chronometry, and for this additional reason wo are under an essential
 preliminary difficulty as to attaching any clear meaning to the words
uniform           rectilinear      motion as commonly employed, the uniformity
being that of equality of spaces passed over in equal times.
      If    two balls         are altering     their distance apart, we cannot suppose
that they are both at rest.                    One, at least, must be in motion.
  Men have very good means of knowing in some cases, and of
imagining in other cases, the distance between the points of space
simultaneously                occupied by the centres of two balls             ;   if,   at least, we
be content to waive the                  difficulty   as to imperfection       of our means of
ascertaining             or    specifying,      or    clearly    idealising,    simultaneity       at
distant places.               For this we do commonly              use signals by sound,          by
light, by electricity,              by connecting           wires or bars, and by various
other means.               The time required in the transmission of tho signal
involves          an imperfection in human powers of ascertaining                              simul
taneity of occurrences in distant                      places.     It   seems,     however, pro
bably not to involve                   any difficulty of idealising         or imagining          tho
existence of simultaneity.                     Probably     it   may not be felt to involve
any        difficulty comparable             to that of attempting to form               a   distinct
notion          of identity of     place at successive          times in unmarked space.
   There          is,   in the nature of things,        a   real distinction,      cognisable by
men, between                     (or absolute clinural motion) and
                          absolute rotation
absolute freedom from rotation (or absolute clinural rest).*
   The only motion of                   a   point that men        can   know of or can deal
with        is   motion       relative      to one, two, three, or more other points.
Three points marked or indicated                       on one, two, or three bodies, the
centres,         for instance, of three balls, whether preserving their dis
tances          apart, unchanging           or not, are sufficient        for enabling         us to
construct or to imagine                a    reference framo of any changeless                configu

to be      in   one same iximre.

     Any arrangement whatever of points, lines, or planes, changeless
in mutual configuration, will, for presont purposes,                                        be named as a
reference  frame, or briefly as a frame.
     Tho word motion, in ordinary usages,                              has several varied signi
ficances.
     1.    Thus it is often said that               a body, or rather some specified                     point
of   it,   has performed            a   motion from           a   point   A   to   a   point    B,   along a
straight         or curved line of motion                     AMB.         It      may be often said
that this same motion                    has    been effected             slowly on one occasion
and quickly on another, speed                       or velocity of the moving point not
being treated as any essential quality or condition of the motion.
                                                                                B
     2.    Again,       it   is   often said that         a       point, moving             along   a    curve
GABH,            has   a     certain motion at tho instant                    of its passing         A, and
that its motion undergoes change during                               the passage from               A   to   B,
and that at        B    it    has   a   motion changed from that which                        it   had at A.
In this      sense the motion at               A   is   regarded as determined by the line
of motion specified as being the tangent to the curve at A, and the
ward, or way, of the motion along its line at tho point of contact                                            A,
and the velocity of the motion at that point.                                  The velocity of the
motion       is    usually understood as meaning                     a    true time rate of motion
—    a    rate    which may             bo specified, for instance, as being that                        of   so
many feet per second, or the like.                                  For this ordinary               mode      of
specifying             that which        is   to be called velocity,            it     is   necessary      that

true chronometry should have heen previously attained to, in idea
at least, and approximately in fact.
    Sometimes it is found          convenient to apply, temporarily         at least,
the name velocity (for want of any other name) to the rate of travel
of a point along a line as referred to the progress of something else
moving relatively to       a  frame or to   a  dial.   Thus, for   a point moving
along   a line, the motion at any       point of the path may sometimes            bo
said to have     a velocity of so many feet per            unit of angular     spaco
turned by the crank shaft of              a    steam   engine relatively     to the
framing of the steam engine.              What is thus        specified   might   be
called   a  quad-velocity,      not a true velocity, as it is customary to
regard    true velocity      as being   referred not to the revolution of a
steam engine shaft, nor to the revolution of            a  hand of    a badly-going
clock, but to the progress of absolutely true time when once the idea
 of progress   of true time has been arrived at
    Before arriving      at any principle       of absolute chronometry, how
 ever, wo cannot deal with true velocity at all.              We cannot specify     a
rate of progress of any moving point relatively to progress                  of true
time, or relatively to progress of a clock hand on its dial advancing
 proportionally     to progress of true time.         But, without assuming or
presupposing       any principle     of absolute chronometry, we can refer
motions of points to an assumed               reference   frame,  jointly with an
assumed      dial-traveller.      The dial-traveller       may conveniently       be
imagined     as a clock      hand or index travelling        continuously    along  a
graduated dial, such as the face of a clock, but without the adapta
tion of any pendulum             or balance wheel, or other ehronometric
arrangement for regulating the motion of the hand.               The traveller, for
instance, might be kept moving round its dial by                  a  winch handle,
such as that of a grindstone, or of        a  barrel organ, turned by hand. Or
it  might be an index projecting out radially from the crank shaft of a
steam engine, and revolving round a dial fixed to the adjacent frame
work of the engine,      so as to surround the shaft.       Or the traveller might
be an index kept revolving           by the shaft of       a water wheel, with a
motion depending on variable conditions of rain-fall and stream-flow.
    For purely      kinematic     considerations     as to relative     motions    of
points or bodies we have no essential concern with true time, nor
with true velocities, understood         as velocities of motions relative to a
frame, and specified quantitatively          as true time rates.

    Now, reverting to the essential difficulty already mentioned             as to
 our forming     a  distinct   conception either of rest or of uniform recti
 linear motion, wo may go forward to some further considerations and
 scrutinies as to what men can imagine             or can really know through
 observation     and experience respecting          motions    of bodies in the
 universe of space.
    We may have         a firm persuasion, even     without perfect understand
 ing, that   in the nature of things there must         be a reality correspond
 ing to our glimmering          idea of motion of a body along a straight
 course with changeless velocity, and that there must be an essential
 distinction between such motion and motion along a curved course
or motion with varying velocity.                 We cannot, however, specify
such motions relatively to unmarked space and unmeasured passage
of time.      We cannot specify them           as to any condition    of absolute
rest.    We can only specify them as to part of their characters, or
conditions, or distinctions.         We can do so only in so far as quali
ties or distinctions       of motions of one or more bodies can be ascer
tained through        knowable     relations between these motions and the
motions of one or more other bodies.                 Briefly,  we can deal   only
with relative motions or relative rest         ; not with absolute motions nor
absolute rest
    Sir Isaac Newton         sets forth, under the designation of the       First
Law of Motion, the statement that — Every body continues in its
state of resting or of moving uniformly in a straight course, except in
so much as, by applied forces,         it is compelled  to change that state.
    A  most important        truth in the nature of things, perceived with
more    or less    clearness, is at the root of this enunciation, but the
words, whether taken by themselves or in connection with Newton's
prefatory and accompanying definitions             and illustrations,  are inade
quate to give expression to that great natural truth.              In attempting
to draw from the statement a perfectly intelligible conception, we
find ourselves confronted           with the preliminary difficulty or im
possibility   as  to forming any perfectly distinct notion of a meaning

notion of identical points or places in unmarked                          space at successive

      To aid in      the apprehension          of the underlying truth referred to,
and also as an aid to the understanding of the enunciation about to
be     given in     the present paper as The             Laic of Inertia        and  Principle
 of Chronometry,            some      purely kinematic          principles will       now be
 adduced        for  consideration.        Thus the question is to be opened up
 as to    what     may be the nature         of relative motions of various bodies,
 which can in any sense truly                     be regarded        as  uniform rectilinear
 mutual motions.             Explanations        are to be given on such motions              of
 points      in unmarked           space,   as    can    have    a reference frame          and
  reference      dial-traveller      relatively to which jointly            those  motions are
  rectilineanar and          are    uniform in the         sense   of    being changeless in
  guasi-velocity.        In   other words, quite to the same effect — Explana
  tions are to be given un such nujtions of points in unmarked space as
   can hove a reference frame relatively to which those motions are
   rectilinear and are changeless in mutual rate; or what is the same,
   are mutually proportional in their simultaneous                     progress.
       Let us imagine       a reference      frame, rigid in its configuration, and
   for simplicity let it       be taken    as   including three rectangular reference
   planes     firmly   connected.         Let    several     points or small bodies          be
   kept moving by geared mechanism,                    such as that of toothed          wheels
    on variously inclined         axles, and toothed          straight sliding racks with
   piuions, all carried         or   guided in bearings           firmly attached        to the
    reference frame,      the    arrangements         being such        that those moving
    points   shall be made simultaneously to travel over mutually pro
    portional     lengths     along     straight lines        fixed     in relation     to  the
    reference frame.       The motion may be given by                  a  winch handle like
    that of a barrel     organ,     fixed on one of the axles             ;  and, for help in
    consideration     of the subject, we may imagine               a  uniformly graduated
    dial surrounding the winch handle axle, and                     an index attached        to
     the axle   so as to project radially outwards like a hand of a clock,
    and to    travel round the dial keeping pace in angular motion with
     the winch handle.          Thus the simultaneous             travels      of the various

 small bodies along their straight courses are to be mutually propor
 tional,   and they are also to be proportional                each   of them to the
 simultaneous      travel of the index         on the diaL        Now,    if  any other
 frame of three co-ordinate           planes be arranged to exist with the
 point of their intersection keeping at any one of the moving points,
 and with the three planes maintaining                changeless     angles with the
 original three reference        planes, any one of the moving               points   will
 either be at rest relatively to the new set of reference               planes, or will
 generate,   in relation to them,       a straight line, and the simultaneous
 lengths    traversed by the various points relatively                 to these new
 reference planes      will be mutually proportional.               It  is convenient
 to notice, in preparation for subsequent reference of motions to true
 time or to   a  truly chronometric clock, that the simultaneous lengths
 traversed by the various           points     relatively    to the new        reference
 planes, and of the winch handle index relatively to its dial,                   will  be
 mutually proportional.          We may thus see that for the established
 set   of   motions    of  the points,       there can exist as many sets of
 reforence    planes or frames as we please,               differently    moving      and
 differently inclined, in reference         to each of which        every one of the
 points will generate     a   straight line with a quasi-velocity (or rate per
 dial- traveller   progress)    proportional      to  the quasi-velocity of every
 other along its own line.           We    are now perfectly entitled          to speak
of the motions of all these            points as referred to any one of the
 frames and the original         dial-traveller,    as being uniform         rectilinear
 motions.      The word uniform, it should be noticed,                has, neither     in
its origin nor in its customary employment, any essential connection
with progress of time. The notion besides of the dial-traveller as a
standard to which the simultaneous                 travels of the various points
may conveniently be referred, or rated, is not at all essential.                     Wo
would be quite entitled, without knowledge                    of chronometry, and
without having        recourse    to the quasi-time indicated            by the dial-
tiaveller,   to speak of the motions          of all the points relatively to all
the reference      frames,   as being     uniform      rectilinear    motions.       The
uniformity in rate of        progress   would     bo  in  respect to rate of travel
of any one of the points per simultaneous travel of any other one of
them.      In  all that has been said in this matter no assumption has
been made as to any particular            copdition of rest or motion having
bolongod to the original reference           frame.      It  may have been firmly

  standing any such motions, or any motions whatever, belonging to
  the original reference frame, the mutual motions of the points will-
  possess the character that they admit of having reference                   frames,     as
  many    as we please,      relative to which they          will    bo rectilinear and
 mutually      proportional     (or, in other words, they             will  bo uniform
 rectilinear motions, by mutual            reference    without    reference    to time).
 If   the moving       points alone were available to us for progressive
 observation      or measurement it might               be  a   difficult,  perhaps an
 extremely difficult,       geometrical        or kinematical       problem*     to find
 from them       a reference    frame accomplishing           the stated     condition     ;
 l>ut this does not hinder us from easily and               distinctly understanding
 that such     a frame is geometrically or kinematically                  possible.     On
 the other hand, for        a set   of points moving at random like flies in
 the air, or for    a set   of points having uniform rectilinear motion as
 already     described, together with others revolving liko satellites
 round    some   of them, no      reference       frame to accomplish        the condi
 tions stated would       be possible.         For    a single fly moving       anyhow,
 reference frames would be possible, relative to any one of which the
 motion of the fly would            be rectilinear,      and would       be uniform      in
rate of progress relatively to true time, or to any assumed standard
whatever for rate of progress; but for two flies, or any greater
number, no such frame would be possible.                     Reasons for this are so
obvious     as scarcely to require statement.              Briefly, however, it may
be mentioned        that any two flies might              in their mutual motions
come into contact once and then separate, and then come into con
tact again    ; but no 6econd       meeting could occur with points moving

                                                  evening of tlio reading of the paper
(March 3,    1884), just  after the  close  of  the  meeting of the Society, the author
inquired of Professor Tait whether he could see how the problem referred to
here in the paper as being perhaps extremely difficult, could be solved.              Pro
fessor Tait replied that he could solve it very briefly by use of quaternions.
The author, not being at all acquainted with quaternions, has since seeu his
way clearly to the solution by an easy method of mechanical adaptations.               The
mechanical method is merely for intellectual use, not for practical application.
The ideal mechanism can serve as an instrument for use in reasoning, though
friction, and elasticity of materials, ice., might render it iucapable of complete
practical realisation.

 apart and afterwards         diminishing it      ;  but no approach after reces
 sion is possible for points moving straightly and proportionally in
 relation to any frame whatever.
    The explanations now given            are sufficient to show that there can
 bo mutual motions of various bodies, so related as to have a pro
 perty of being uniform         rectilinear   mutual motions, and to explain
 the nature of that mutual relation.                This is quite irrespective of
 any idea of chronometry, or any idea of absolute rest or motion in
the universe, or of any idea of absolute clinural                   rest   or absolute
rotation, and of any distinction           whereby one body might be said to
"be  in absolute rotation and another devoid of absolute rotation.
The mutual relation described            has  been     purely kinematic, and       will
not be at all altered by the superposition of any new motion whether
of translation or of rotation, the meaning of this statement being
rendered      intelligible by consideration           of    the attachment of the
original reference frame to        the floor and side walls of the cabin          of   a
ship   at sea, already mentioned.
    Now, to    pass from mere geometric or kinematic              motions, governed
mutually by connecting mechanism to the motions of bodies existing
in   space   free from any such governance, we are to accept as an
established law of nature, established through                 multitudinous     obser
vations and speculations, together with theories confirmed by multi
tudinous agreements,        the following, which may be called the law of
inertia.
                               Tlis Law of Inertia.
    For any     set of bodies acted on each           by any    force,   a reference
frame and      a  reference      dial-traveller        are kinematically      possible,
such that relatively       to them conjointly,           the motion of the mass-
centre of each       body, undergoes change simultaneously                   with any
infinitely short element of the dial-traveller               progress,   or with any
element during which the force on the body docs not alter in direc
tion nor in magnitude, which           change   is proportional      to the intensity
of the force acting on that body, and to the simultaneous                     pro^resi:
of the dial-traveller,    and is made in the direction of the force.

                          Principle of Chronometry.
    From the foregoing law it is readily deducible,            as a corollary by
elementary mathematical considerations, that —
    Any dial-traveller which would accomplish the conditions stated
would make progress proportionally             with any other dial-traveller,
obtained likewise from the        same    set  of bodies, or any other set of
bodies with the      same or any other reference frame.            Then, in view
of this remarkable      agreement,    we define as being equal intervals of
time, or we     assume as being somehow         in their own nature intrinsi
cally and necessarily equal intervals of time, the intervals during
which any such dial-traveller passes over equal spaces on its dial.
Thus, any dial-traveller which would accomplish the conditions
stated would constitute a perfect chronometer.
    This gives    us the ideal of a perfect chronometer.           It  remains fur
men to aim at approaching         as near as they can        towards that ideal
in the practical realisation of good chronometry.
     For good and long-enduring realisations of chronometry,                  astro
nomical methods        are alone available.        None of    these   present any
 simple method of procedure. They require hypothetical assump
 tions of supposed forces acting on the bodies considered, and, above
 all, there is involved in them the assumption, and after multitudinous
 tests, accompanied       by multitudinous confirmations,           the discovery
 of the Law of Universal Gravitational Attraction — the grandest of
 the discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton.
      Principle of Absolute Clinural Rest and of Absolute Rotation.
     Any straight line fixed relatively to any           reference   frame which
  accomplishes the conditions specified in the statement of the law of
  inertia  has absolute   clinural  rest.    If   another straight line fixed in
  any other such reference frame        be parallel     to that former lino, the
  two lines will continue parallel,       so that    by either of them the       one
  same absolute clinure       is permanently        preserved.      The   principle
  here called that of absolute clinural rest is clearly enunciated in
  Thomson and Tait's Natural Philosophy,              § 249, under the designa
  tion of " Directional Fixedness."         It   is there exhibited      by  a  very
  simple device, and here by a somewhat different method.

   Any body which            has    no rotation      relative   to a framing     which
accomplishes the conditions             stated is devoid of absolute rotation,
and    if  a body rotates relatively to any such frame                it has the  same
rotation absolutely.
    The Law of Inertia        here enunciated sets forth all the           truth which
is either explicitly stated or is suggested              by the First and Second
Laws in Sir Isaac Newton's arrangement
    By applying the Law of Inertia to the                 case  in which the forces
acting on the bodies vanish, the law becomes a remodelled substitute
for the statement set forth by Sir Isaac Newton as the                    First Law of
Motion in his arrangement.

The only difficulty which lies in the way of finding the correspond

in integers of the indeterminate equation                     —

     10. The         theorems of the preceding four paragraphs, or even of
§§ 6, 7, 9, afford a complete solution of the equation of condition.
The process may                be thus described.                    It        depends upon the solution
of equations of two types,                     A     and    B say          ;   of which
              (v, w,      x,y,z)      = 2{u, v, w, x,               y)                                             (A)
and           (», w, x, y, z) =               (v,   w, x,     y)   +   (w, x, y,         «)   + (w, x,    y) .     (D)
are examples.              The equation of condition,                               to begin with,           is   of the
type    A.         We show that this can be made dependent upon an equa
tion of the type  but of lower order, and upon an equation of the
                               A
type B.   Next we show that the equation of type  depends on the                               B
solution of another of type  of lower order, and on the solution of
                                                B
two equations of type                    A
                            Thus by repeated partial solutions the
desired result            is   obtained.
  A     caution, however,                is   requsite in regard to the ultimate equations
of the       two types.            In    the case of type                  A       the ultimate form may bo
either                          (x, y,   z)   = 2(w, x,         y)                      (   Az)   ,
or                              (y,z)         =2(z,2/)                                  (AJ.
The former has for solutions
                                   (1)        z=2w,x          =     2y,                      \

 the latter has                               z=2z+l,y=l                       .
      In     the   case   of type     B   the ultimate form may be either
 or                                   (x,y)=            x       +      y        +1                    (BJ
 The solutions of the former                        are

     13.   The well-known property regarding the quadratic                    form    to
which the integers belong whose square roots have culminate cycles,
suggests that the coefficient of m in the general expression for these
 numbers (§ 4) must have the same form.                  We    are thus led      to the
 curious theorem: —
    V    (q          q»-i) = 2(qi           q..s)  then                q,.,) is of tl.r

    This further suggests the inquiry as to how A and B are to                       be
 obtained in any particular case, —how, for example, knowing that
                         a, 26, c, 2c, b, 2a,       { }
 is a culminate cycle, we can partition           (a, 2b, c,      2c , b, 2a) into     a
 square and the double        of a square.     The result is
               (a, 2b, c, 2c, b, 2a)     =  2(a, 26,e)* + (6, 2«)»,
 where the element 2c separates          the given continuant           into two con
 tinuants which are        B and A.     Similarly we have

     14.   Closely associated with culminate cycles            are those     in which
 tho middle element of the cycle is less by           1  than the unique partial
 quotient ; for example,

 Indeed, the two cases are almost co-extensive with the case where
 the middle element of the cycle of divisors              is 2 :  the exact state of
 matters being that       if the middle element of the cycle of divisors             be
 2  the cycle of partial quotients       is culminate      or peneculminate, and
 if the latter cycle be culminate or peneculminate the middle element
 of the divisors      is 2, except in the solitary instance of ^/12 whew
 it is  3.
     The complete theory of peneculminate cycles can                  be very shortly
 given after what has preceded.

                            w,...,o-,p,ir,{                  }
and there are no other peneculminate cycles.
    The     equation       of    condition       T?,_1 +   Q,_,   = 2P,_2    is inapplicable
when z = 2 or         1 : in the former        case we have
                ^^"                 =  A   +

in the latter, the solitary example
    20.    The    same    considerations which led to the theorem of § 13
give us     now the theorem : —
    Jf    (qi             q.-i)   + (q2>   • ¦ ¦ ,     q. i) = 2(qi, . . . , q,-a) then
fai   >• • • ,   q»-i)       °f   the form A2 + 21!2 or A2 - 2B2, according as
i  is odd    or   even.
    Also, the expressions for               A    and     B present themselves in tho
same     simple manner as before             : thus for the cycles above obtained
we have
             (1
                  ,b,l,      26 +   2,   1)=     -2(1     ,&)2 + (26 +    2, l)2;
             (26 +    2,  1   ,6,    1 ,  1)=    -2    • I2       +(1  ,6,1,     l)2;
             (2,          2,2,2,l)=-2.22                         +(2,2,1)2.
     21.   It   only remains now to             see   if  we can ascertain        how many
 different     kinds of culminate and peneculminate cycles there ought
 to Ixi   with    a given number of elements.                  If  tho number of elements
 be 2z, then       in the   case    of culminate cycles what we have to find is
 the number         of solutions of an equation of type                A   (§ 10) and of the
    —                       Let the said number be denoted by a,_2 and let
 (z    2)th degree.
 P  be used      in  a similar way       in connection with equations of type B.
 Then (§ 10)        we have the pair of difference-equations
                                     o»-a=     "i-4   +  A-,    )

                                     al =   2,ft = 3.
From the two equations           by division we have
                                 0,-2
                                                        a,.   4
 Therefore    when    z is even
                               a,.a   =  (2, 2, 2,...)j,.a
                               /8,.,-(l, 2,2, 2,...)|..,
 where the suffix after the bracket of the continuant is used to                         indi
 cate   the number of elements in the continuant                     ;  and
         when  x  is odd
                             a,.2 =    (2,2,2,....)«!-3)
                             A.,= (l, 2,2, 2,. ..)«,-«
 Putting    z =  2r and then      z =   2r  + 1 we see       that
                              «->

  itnd that there is thus no need of stating the                       two cases separately.
  Our result may therefore be put thus                :  The number        of different kinds
  of culminate     cycles having 2z elements is
                                    ('2    2   2          )

  and the member of different kinds of peneculminate                      cycles  of the same
   extent is

        This instrument consists essentially of          a   cryophorus, one bulb of
which       is   kept wet by the same arrangement                 as    is   used for   a   wet-
bulb thermometer, while the other bulb                     left dry. For con

594                 Proceedings   of  the Royal Society
condition    during that time.       Preliminary observations     with this
instrument    show    that even in comparatively       moist    weather the
total evaporation     during twenty-four     hours is great enough to be
easily measured.
   The instrument is intended primarily to       be used for    determining
the total evaporation    from tanks and other free surfaces of water.
For this purpose it will be used first in connection with an atmo-
meter, devised by Mr G. K. Winter and myself, by means of which
we hope to determine      with greater accuracy than has yet been done
the total evaporation from the surface of a tank.            By this means
the constant of the hygrometer        will be obtained, and future deter
minations can be made with the hygrometer alone.
   Other uses of the instrument      will at once suggest themselves, but
it is not  necessary  to go into details till more complete observations
 have been made.

                                 James Blyth.
    This instrument consists of    a close spiral of insulated   copper wire
 bent into the form of an anchor ring, so as to form              an endless
 solenoid.    The spiral is placed in   a rectangular groove   turned on the

edge   of    a wooden or brass       ring of suitable thickness and diameter.
Short lengths of wire at both ends of the copper spiral are left
straight.        These, after being well insulated, are twisted together and
led to two terminals, which serve as electrodes.                     The ring containing
the spiral is fixed on a base board with its plane vertical, and at
right angles to the magnetic meridian, when the instrument is in                        use.
A   short magnet, rigidly attached at right angles to the lower end of
a  stiff wire, is suspended from               a  silk fibro,    so that     its centre is
in the circular centre line of the anchor ring.                    Near the upper end
of the wire a long glass fibre
pointer       is    attached,    which
 moves over a horizontal disc
graduated         to    degrees,    and
the whole is so enclosed so
that     the magnet, fibre, and
 pointer are free from currents
 of air.      Fig.   1 gives  a  sketch
 of the arrangement, showing,
however, the convolutions             of
 the wire much too far apart.

These       are    in   reality quite
close together on the inner side, the spiral being tied tight into the
rectangular groove by means of               a   cord.

    From this formula it will            be seen that the galvanometer             constant
can be very easily determined, since                it depends only upon         ?• and n.

magnetic shell, it can exert no magnetic force outside the shell                  ;
and hence the current          will have no      effect  upon   any system     of
permanent magnets that may be employed to produce a stronger
magnetic field surrounding       the needle.

1.   On Galvanic Currents passing through               a  very Thin Stratum
       of an Electrolyte.        By Professor H. von Helmholtz.
    If  one closes a galvanic     circuit   containing    a small   battery, the
electromotive force of which is not able to decompose               water, and  a
voltameter with two platinum plates dipping into water acidulated
with sulphuric       acid, the current has     a  great intensity in the first
moment, and diminishes          at first very rapidly,      afterwards    slowly.
At last its intensity approaches to        zero more and more, but it never
ceases completely.        The more sensitive the galvanometer by wliich
you measure its intensity,      the longer the time during which you are
able to observe the deflection of the needle.         If the electrolytic fluid is
in contact with atmospheric air, it is      easy, even   with a galvanometer of
 simple construction      and moderate sensibility, to observe that at last
a feeble residue of current remains, keeping a nearly constant             inten
sity.     This intensity, however, is increased by the slightest motion
of the fluid, also by feeble motions produced by changes of tempera
 ture.    Under   these conditions,    it is nearly impossible to determine
by measurement regular relations           between the electromotive        forw.

the resistance, and the intensity of the current.           Three years ago      I
had    the   honour     to describe     before   the  Royal Society     a  little
apparatus, hermetically sealed and purified as much as           I  was able to
do from all traces of oxygen and hydrogen.              There  I thought    that
the current could be really reduced to zero.            But since that time     I
have applied an extremely delicate galvanometer, and             I  have found
that this cell also lets pass a never-ceasing current         even   with small
electromotive     forces.    The residual current remaining         under such
conditions is indeed only the ten thousandth or hundred thousandth
part of the current which would be produced by the same electro
motive force in a metallic conductor of the same galvanic resistance,
and    it  goes   on decreasing through          weeks and    weeks   before    it
becomes constant,         or rather    oscillating   about  a  constant    mean
value.
    Lately   I have   tried to shorten the time through which one has to
wait for such observations, and to increase the intensity of the
residual current by making the stratum of electrolytic fluid between
two plane surfaces of platinum very thin.             I have used plane plates
of glass lying horizontally and separated by very thin little pieces
of clean glass. The two plane plates were platinised along their
interior   surfaces,   and the platinum covering of the superior plate (a
rectangle of about 10 and 5 cm. side), which was smaller than the
 inferior, extended over      a part of   its upper side in order to fix on the
upper sides of both plates two little hollow cylinders of paper con
taining mercury in contact with the platinum.              By the mercury the
 platinum could      be connected    with the other parts of the circuit.
    If one brings    drops of the electrolytic fluid near to the margin of
the upper plate, they       are sucked   in by capillary force into the fissure
 between     the plates and kept fast there.         The galvanic resistance of
 the little apparatus is only       a small fraction of an ohm, and can be
 neglected when compared with the other parts of the circuit, which
 contained     about 600 ohms.         The fluid at the     edge   of the upper
 plate was in contact with atmospheric air, and therefore saturated
  with atmospheric oxygen according to its density in the atmo
 sphere.
     I was able, indeed, with this little apparatus, to get the constant
  value of the residual        current   after   six or twelve hours,     and to

598                 Proceedings      of  the  Royal Society
have    it unusually    strong.    If  one compares       the intensity of the
 residual current with that which would have been produced                      in a
 metallic   conductor of the same resistance (600 ohms), it was about
 0025 of the latter with an electromotive force of 0 8 Daniell, 0-125
 with TO Daniell,      0*4  with   2 0   Daniells.     I  shall not try to give
 you more exact numbers, because          I hope   to get them still more accu
 rate than they are at present.        But there was not the slightest         trace
 of evolution of   gas.    And you     see   that even with two Daniells         the
 current which was kept up required             the force of 0-8 Daniells to
 overcome the resistance of the circuit           Therefore, only    1 -2 Daniells
 remained for the decomposition of the water, which are insufficient
 to develop the two gases under atmospheric pressure.                By reducing
 the resistance of the circuit to 300 ohms          I could get a decomposing
 force of l-36 Daniells.      But   also this was not sufficient        for visible
 decomposition.      The arrangement of the apparatus used hitherto
 did not admit of going farther.          For these experiments       a  very con
 stant electromotive force is needed, which is steady through months,
 and of which well-measured         parts can be derived        to pass through
 the electrolyte, and   I  had not yet had the time to introduce              those
 modifications   of the apparatus which         are necessary    for the employ
 ment of higher electromotive force.
    These experiments show that in this case a current of about 0"002
 ampere could     pass    contantly     through     acidulated    water   without
developing any visible trace of oxygen and hydrogen.
    I don't think, nevertheless, that the electrolytic          law of Faraday
 is violated in this case.    I suppose     that really oxygen and hydrogen
exist separately at the electrodes,         only they don't      bubble    off, but
remain dissolved      in the fluid, where they exist electrically              neu
tralised, being no longer subject to electric attraction, and therefore
free to migrate through       the fluid by diffusion.         But when electri
cally neutral   oxygen reaches the cathode, where positive electricity
is subject to the attraction of the negative electricity of the metal,
it will yield its + E far easier to the cathode than does hydrogen.
And the same will happen at the anode.               Neutral hydrogen, carried
over by diffusion, will yield its -E easier to the positive metal
than the anion      oxygen will do.         This,  as you    see, produces     only
a   convoctive   current    of   electricity.      At the cathode         diffused

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                 5«J9
  oxygen, having given off its           +  E  and now charged with              - E,  will
  combine -with the kation            + H.      At    the anode diffused hydrogen,
  after   having    received      a positive      charge       from    the    metal,   will
  combine with the anion            - 0.      So the results of the electrolytic
  decomposition      of    water     are    annihilated         continually.      Oxygen,
 charged     negatively,     migrates      as anion       from    the   cathode     to the
 anode, then, neutralised,        it is carried back to the cathode.               Hydro
 gen, charged and discharged, goes              in the opposite direction.             The
 work done by the electromotive force of the battery is not chemical
 decomposition, but        it is this migration of the constituents of the
 fluids   by which heat ought to              be evolved.         That    heat, which is
 evolved by the migration of the ions, falls under the heat evolved
 by galvanic resistance, but the heat evolved by diffusion                      ought to
 be   proportional to the intensity of the current.                     But before this
 stationary state of the current can be produced, electrolytic                      decom
 position must go on       till the required amount of             gases is dissolved    in
 the  fluid,  if there is not already          from      the beginning       a sufficient
quantity     of one of the     gases, viz., oxygen,         of the atmosphere in solu
tion.     Here the thermodynamic inferences                  come into play,     which    I
have developed        lately from the law of Carnot.                 They show that       a
limited quantity of the          gases can be produced             electrolytically   even
by very feeble electromotive forces,             till  a   certain value of density of
the dissolved      gases corresponding         to the value of the decomposing
force has been reached.
    Out of    these thermodynamic           laws one can develop             a complete
mathematical theory of galvanic polarisation and its effects.                       As far
as the accuracy      of my measurements           reaches,      the facts appear to be
in sufficient harmony with such             a theory.

delle trasformazioni          razionali      nello spazio, come da un sistema piano
di punti, rette        e   curve si possono dedurre la costruzione e le pro

rappresentabili punto per punto sul piano).
     Se sono dati sei punti 123456                    in un piano, per         essi  passano
quindici retto       e sei     coniche.         Ciascuno de' sei punti        è   doppio   per
infinite cubiche (curve di                3° ordine)      passanti per gli altri cinque,
formanti      un    fascio    ;  le tangenti        nel punto doppio sono perciò in
involuzione.         I   sei  punti doppi danno così sei involuzioni                   Allora
si può domandare di costruire una curva K6 di 6° ordine, che abbia
sei punti doppi in 123456               e   per tangenti altrettante coppie delle sui
 involuzioni.       Il    problema        è  risoluto     dalle Iacobiane       delle reti di
 cubiche passanti           per   i   sei   punti dati.         Le K6 costituiscono un
sistema lineare tre volte infinito, ossia sono combinazioni lineari di
 quattro K8 fra loro indipendenti.                      Vi sono altre involuzioni, in
 ciascuna delle quindici rette e delle sei coniche.                       L' involuzione in

 sempre in coppie di punti dell' involuzione.                         Vi sono poi infiniti

  1.   On the Construction         of the Canon of Logarithmic Sines.
                          By Edward Sang, LL.D.
    In setting about the construction of the Canon of Logarithmic
Sines,    we naturally look for any means             of lessening the heavy
labour of the undertaking.
    The very first table of logarithms, that given by Nepair in his
Canon     Mirifiem, was       one of logarithmic     sines, and was made by
the actual    computation       of the logarithms     as given     in Reinhold's
table    of sines   (see Constructio,    section 39).    But, in the modem
text-books on trigonometry,         we are told that the logarithms may be
computed independently          of the sines themselves.        If this  computa
tion be less      laborious    than, and as trustworthy as, the operation
from the already computed sines, it must be adopted.                  Our canons
of sines, and of logarithms         to fifteen   places, then only serve       for
occasional verifications.
    In the introduction        to Callct's   admirable    collection    of Tables
 Portatives, the investigation       of the formulie and the        series for the
logarithmic sines are given.         According to the rule strictly followed
in the preceding works, each of our steps must be made independ

critically the deduction of the                       formulae              themselves, and of the series
resulting from them.

divisible by            1   --.       But the cosine                 is     also zero for a =                - q,

   Here the progression is so slow that, after five hundred divisions,
which bring us to the divisor 1001, we have got only to the sixth
place.   The convergence is becoming rapidly               less, and we should
need   to use   five thousand        million of terms      ere our     quotient  be
brought below the twentieth           decimal place.       Worse than that : —

to say,   with five thousand million of terms we shall not be                                                    sure of
the result in the tenth place.
     Thus it is clear that M. Callet did not get his numbers by                                                           the
summation of the series                          ; he    must have got them elseways.                              These
series, though interesting                            and    valuable, are useless in calculation                               ;
they are not even established by the arguments                                               adduced.        The      logic
is as faulty as the logistics.
     When       a    polynome consists of                          a   finite number of terras,                   each a
multiple of an integer positive power of some variable x, and when
the substitution               of     a   definite value               r for x renders               that    polynome
zero,   it is    easy to show that the expression is divisible by the differ
ence    x-   /•,    the quotient being another polynome one degree lower                                                   in
rank.
     The proof of this theorem rests essentially on the finitude of                                                       the
expression       ;     the very idea of                          divisibility implies                a   termination.
Hence in extending this law to interminate progressions                                                     we destroy
the foundation                on which                the argument rests.                     Granted the use              of
unending scries, wo may divide any finite polynome by any binome,
the quotient being an endless progression                                     ;    there       is   now no indivisi
bility, and          the adjective divisible                       ceases to have               a   meaning.          It   is
absurd to say that the progression
                                  ,        .r2           a-4             x*              .
is   divisible        by      1       2;          the result of the division                         by any binome
of the form           1   - a,t-      will        be    a    progression arranged according to                            the
ascending           even powers              of x.           If   we divide the quotient by another
binome       1      - fix2,       the new quotient again by                             1    - yx2,   and so on,          we
shall find no obstacle                       to the          divisibility          except       the labour of             the
operation.            Shall we thence                       argue that the original series                         is     the
continued            product          of         (1   - ax-)(\ - y8z2)(l - yx-)                1     Truly       not,      for

  The fallacy of these arguments may ho clearly seen from another
point of view.  A certain curve crosses the line of abscissae at equal
intervals            extending            indefinitely both ways.                                   If        we place the origin
of the abscissa at the middle of one of the intervals, and denote the
ordinate y by the general symbol                                  <£z,        y   becomes                  zero on substituting
for x any odd multiple of the half interval                                                ;       which half interval wo
shall denote by q                ;       that is to say,               <f>(   ±   q)  ,            <j>(   ± 3q) ,   <£(   ± 5q)   ,   ike,
are    all       zero.      Hence, according to these arguments, the expression
for   y     or   <fix    must be the continued product of the factors

and thus             our curve can be none other than the curve of sines                                                          ;    or,

we observe        that this series is convergent for every value of x less
than unit, and even so for unit itself ; but that for any value of x
greater than       unit by however little, its terms ultimately increase                                            so
that their sum either is infinite, or represents an unreality.                                                 It   is
thus a moot question whether                            just at the limit x=                  1,   <f>x   be or be

     Having constructed            a      logarithmic           curve with            AB      for its base and
AO for the length of its subtangent, take in it                                            some     point C and
draw  CE parallel to BA, then EC is the logarithm of AE. Hence
if we place the origin of co-ordinates at 0 and denote OA by unit,
OE by x, we have CE = - log (1 -                                x).
     If   now    we continue              a    straight         line OC to           meet      AB in D, and
draw      DF    parallel to      AO to             meet the continuation                     of EC, EF = AD
becomes          -—      @ ——     ^

                     x
the corresponding            point        F    will trace the curve shown in the figure.
When       C    comes to     0,   the secant OC merges into the tangent, equally
inclined to the abscissae and ordinates                             ;    hence the distance OG must
be equal to       OA.        When             C    passes to the other side                   of   0,     the curve
continues above          G   still nearing the interminate line                                AOM without
ever reaching to it.             The curve has thus two asymptotes AB and AM.

the present        case, the extension         of the laws of finite equations to
equations involving interminate series is admissible                       ;  but it would
do so at        the expense       of previously        discovering      those coefficients
which were thought to have been found by the summation of the
series   of inverse powers.

   Here, from the expansions of the various powers of A, we have
to collect the terms containing             like powers of x.
   A   study of the character of these expansions enables us to write
out the details       of any one term separately from the rest.                    Thus,     if
we wish       to get the term involving xw, we have to consider all the
combinations giving the tenth power                 ;  from   A we     have only the one
form    c10a:10 ;
                   from A2, xw is got in as many ways as 10 is decom
posable    into two parts,       as 5 + 5, 6 + 4, 7 + 3, 8 + 2, 9 + 1; from A3
in  as  many ways as 10 may be divided into three parts, as                      4 + 4 +    2;
4 + 3 + 3,     and so on.         Hence, altogether, the number of parts of
which the term xw is composed agrees with the number of ways in
which 10 is decomposable.

    The following simple scheme shows the decomposition of               10 and
of all inferior numbers.          The number of parts increases rapidly with
the order of the term: for x* there are 2; for             x3, 3; for x*, 5;  for

the coefficients      with much                   less      labour than the process previously
detailed,     because      each result                is   useful in the subsequent steps                            ;   but
the former has           the advantage of independent                                             computation.           The

     The application         of   these, as     of all   series of the same       kind, to the
construction of tables, is attended with grave inconvenience.                                 This
is well seen in the case of the series for the sines themselves                           ;    for
although those be so convergent                     as to be applicable       for any value
of the arc,     it is      less laborious, and much more exact, to deduce the
values of the sine from its well known properties.                           In   the present
case      the convergence is so slow that the series can only be used for
small arcs.
     The computation            of the canon of logarithmic           sines by their help
alone, would entail more labour than the simple plan of deducing
the logarithm          from the sine, even although we counted the making
of the two previous canons as part of the work

3.     Scottish    Vital Statistics. By Mr George Seton, Advocate,
                                  M.A. Oxon.
     It    is frequently        remarked        that the science of statistics,         in its
various branches,               is,    like the law,       " gloriously     uncertain,"       and
accordingly,      it   is   alleged that, from         of figures, two
                                                         the same    set
intelligent       men can draw very different conclusions.   The same

 020                     Proceedings of          the  Moyal Society
 assertion may, perhaps even more truly, be made                             regarding      fact*,
 which,     although      considered        somewhat         "sair to ding," arc very
differently       interpreted      by different         individuals.*          Interested     mo
tives,    preconceived        opinions,       and illogical conceptions               constitute
some     of the principal causes             of perverted conclusions              ;   and both
facts and figures are very liable                  to misrepresentation.              Hence the
tendency in many quarters to distrust                     the deductions           drawn from
figures of almost every kind, more                      especially      in the columns          of
 official   reports     and     the   prospectuses          of commercial           enterprises-
Even among intelligent and educated men,                         some strangely confused
 ideas prevail        respecting     statistics, many such persons erroneously
supposing        that every class of numerical facte ought to possess                           an
equal amount of certainty and precision, similar to what is produced
 by the abstract figures of an arithmetical                   process.
    When regarded in the true and proper light, and after having
been subjected          to certain requisite           modifications,        the same       series
 of figures cannot possibly              admit      of two inconsistent            conclusions.
On the present occasion, my remarks will                         be   entirely      confined    to
what      are    usually termed         " Vital Statistics,"        as derived         from   the
 national Registers of Births, Marriages, and Deaths.                            The disregard
of what may be termed disturbing                      influences is probably the most
frequent cause of erroneous deductions from the published figures.
Thus, in       one town      district,    with      a  population of 20,000 persons,
the mortality         of the year is found to amount to                         35   per   lOOO    ;
while in another, with the                same      population,     the mortality is only
 20 per 1000.           A  casual reader is apt to jump to the conclusion
that the former district is much more                       unhealthy       than the other;
whereas,      if  he took the trouble to reflect and inquire, he would pro-

      In one of his papers in the Spectator on " The Uncertainty and Absurdity
of Public Reports," Steele refers to the very limited number of persons who can
sec or hear — that is, who can accurately report what they have seen or heard
— either through incapacity or prejudice. After stating that he despises the
man given to narration         under the appellation of         "a   matter of fact mallt', he
defines him as      "one  whose life and conversation is spent           in the report of what
is not matter of fact."         Probably    the    ordinary   estimate    of the individual ic
question   is  somewhat    different  ;  but  it  cannot   be  denied  that   in many instance*
the force of a verbal description depends more upon the look, the voice, and
the gesture than upon the words themselves, and accordingly a very erroneous
impression may sometimes            bo derived from a colourless and undisrerning
narration.

bably find             tbat in the one              district there was         a large       hospital       or
infirmary drawing cases from every corner of the country, and with
an abnormally large mortality,                         while in the other there             was nothing
of the kind            ;    or that, in the one, the condition of the house accom
modation, drainage, and water supply was very faulty, and in the
other quite the reverse.                        As in the        case of deaths, very erroneous
conclusions are apt to be drawn from the statistics                                    of births and
marriages.                 I propose      to make a few observations on each of these
three classes              of events.
      I. Births. — The periodical returns from two parishes, almost iden
tical in population,                social condition, occupation, and other circum
stances, continue to present very different figures                               in the number of
their respective births                   ;   and ordinary            readers are very much per
plexed       by the published                   results.        On inquiry, it is found that in
one     of       the       parishes       the     number         of young      married       couples        is
exceptionally large, while in the other the proportion                                      of bachelors
and elderly married couples is much above the average.  A large
permanent inequality in the numbers of the two sexes is another
manifest explanation of differences in the number of births.                                         When
we compare the number                         of these events reported from                 a parish        in
Orkney           or Shetland              with those occurring               in an inland parish
containing             the same           number           of    ordinary     inhabitants,      we      can
frequently account for the small proportion                                  of the former           by the
circumstance of an unusual number of males having been absent at
sea   for    a   long period.
   In   a paper             which     I   read before the Society last session,                  I    made
some explanatory observations upon the disproportionate                                      numbers of
illegitimate           births in town and country districts                      respectively.          The
principal         cause        of their comparative                   paucity in the former           is,   no
doubt, the barren prostitution of large centres of population.                                       There,
also,   it   is    probable that at least                   a    few illegitimate       births       escape
registration.
      The merely temporary                       residence       of   the   mothers    of illegitimate
children         is    frequently adverted to by registrars of rural districts                              as
unfairly          swelling       the          number       of    these births   ;     and    where      the
domicile          can        be ascertained,         it     is   duly entered in the register.
Others occasionally allude to the circumstance of conception having

G22                    Proceedings of the Royal Society
taken    place elsewhere.        Thus, the registrar of      a  Sutherlandshirc
parish, in   a  comparatively     recent return, states that     " the fathers      of
all the illegitimate children belong to Caithness, while the mothers              are
either servants or outworkers        in the same county, who came home to
be confined."       In like  manner, a Stirlingshire registrar states that no
fewer than sixteen of the mothers of the twenty-seven                 illegitimate
children     registered in     a certain    quarter of the year 1871           were
domestic servants who returned to their homes to give birth to their
children.      Unless, however, the fathers are to be regarded as solely
responsible for the births in these two cases, the parishes in which
the events      occurred    are   hardly entitled to make        an   unqualified
repudiation.
    The existence of     a maternity hospital     in any district usually helps
to increase the number of illegitimate          births, and ought fairly to be
taken into account in every comparative estimate of morality.
    Again, the number of illegitimate births is frequently augmented
by the temporary       residence  of labourers employed in the construction
of railways and other public works.             A   few years ago, the propor
tion of illegitimate births in a certain parish in Perthshire rose from
the normal ratio of about 10 to no less than 20 per cent, the forma
tion of the Oban railway being the cause assigned by the registrar.
 A still higher fluctuation was reported from           a  similar   cause    by  an
Ayrshire registrar, in whose parish the ratio of illegitimacy amounted
to no less than 30'3 per cent,           as  against  74 per cent during         the
 preceding quarter.
    II. Marriages. — Many          causes   contribute  to the fluctuation         in
 the number of marriages in the same parish, as well as to the dis
 proportion between the numbers in parishes similarly circumstanced.
 It  need    scarcely be remarked       that the slate    of trade exercises        a
powerful      influence    on the    matrimonial     market.     When      work is
abundant, wages liberal, and provisions            cheap, the marriage rate is
usually     high; and accordingly         the general    prosperity     and    com
mercial activity of almost any district may be fairly inferred from
 the well-filled     pages   of the marriage register.        This   particulariy
applies to the great mining and manufacturing             districts.     Thus, the
slackness of trade in Scotland            during the years 1858, 1862, and
 1867 caused      the marriages to decline from 5 to 8 per cent.: while

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                 623
the large increase of upwards of 1700 marriages                   in 1870, or nearly
8 per cent, above those           of   the   previous   year, indicated       a   marked
return    of   commercial        prosperity.       Scanty    crops, and       still more
frequently     a   failure in       the    cod    or  herring     fishings,     are   con
stantly mentioned by registrars as accounting for a paucity of mar
riages  ;  and in many instances the same result is attributed to tho
fact of large numbers          of the working classes, in the prime of life,
having     temporarily      left their homes owing             to   dulness     of trade.
Thus, not many           years ago, the registrar          of   a    Ross-shire     parish
reported that
                     " in consequence of the steady falling off of the
haddock and herring fishings, the third quarter had passed without
any entry in the marriage register."                 On the other hand, about the
same period, the registrar          of Fraserburgh       announced that the mar
riages  in that parish had        been 80 per cent, above the average               of the
five previous years,       the herring        fishing  in July, August, and Sep
                                                                  " the value of fish
tember    having proved         so   very successful that
caught,     including      casks      and     curing,   had     been     set   down      at
£130,000."
   Another     cause of fluctuation         in the number of marriages is            to be
found in the season        of   the year.       This is perhaps more observable
in Scotland       than in the other portions of the United Kingdom.
On the north side of the Tweed,                  the month of May has              always
been   unpopular among brides and bridegrooms                   ;  while the last day
of the year, the month            of June, and Martinmas              term have long
been very favourite        periods for matrimonial          contracts.       An impres
sion pretty generally prevails             that May is      an    unlucky month for
matrimony,       and    the origin of the idea has been assigned to the
circumstance        of Queen Mary's marriage to Bothwell having                       been
celebrated in that month.             A  more satisfactory explanation has been
offered    in connection        with tho numerous          changes       of  abode     con
sequent     on the occurrence of the house term, only               a  few days before
the end of the month, thus naturally affecting the monthly average
of marriages, which           are   largely     augmented during the following
month of        June.*     The annexed table, from the Report                      on the
Scottish Census of 1871, shows, in the first column, the number of
 marriages    registered in each month of the ten years ending                       1870,
 while the second column              exhibits the numbers            as  corrected for
                                        See Appendix.

tion, seeing that the number of marriages                      contracted on the last
day of each montli and registered on one of the early days of the
following month counterbalance each other.

    It will   be observed      that the four favourite months for marriage
are    December,      June,     November,          and     July, which         respectively
furnish 17*32,      14 '39, 10-02, and         9 83    per   cent., or more than one-
half (51-56) of the total marriages; while the smallest number of
marriages occurs in May, viz., only 4-86 per cent. — March, Sep
tember,    and April each furnishing less than                6  per cent.
    The favourite      day in Scotland for contracting marriage                         is  the
last day of the year, provided               it   does not      fall   on a Saturday         or
Sunday.*          During  the ten years        in question no fewer than               12,000
of    the  224,222 marriages           contracted took place              on  the 31st of
December — amounting            to    no   less    than 5'35 per cent.          —a      higher
proportion than that of the entire month of May.                            As in France,
the great      annual holiday in Scotland is New- Year's Day, and                            as
   *
      Very marked differences present themselves on the two sides of the Tweed
with reference to the selection of particular days of the week for the celebration
of the marriage ceremony.        While our English neighbours continue to follow
the customs of the Romish Church, tho Scotch seem to be perceptibly influenced
by those of the Puritans.       Accordingly, it will be observed from the figures in

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                    625
 the accompanying festivities             are frequently       continued        for several
 clays, a  marriage celebrated on the last day of the year enables the
 bride and bridegroom           to enjoy a longer honeymoon                   than at any
 other season.         The  same    results are observed, on a smaller scale,
 in connection with most of                the great annual          fairs in Glasgow,
 Dundee,     and other large towns.               Thus, in Glasgow, the               average
 weekly    number of marriages is more than quadrupled                           during the
 week of the yearly        fair in the month of July.
    The comparative percentages                of marriages in        town    and country
 districts respectively       must also be referred to.                The registrars of
 the latter frequently       allude to the practice of persons whose banns
have been proclaimed           in the country proceeding to             some large town
to be married ; and as the event is recorded where                         it takes place,
the marriage register of the parish of domicile is thus deprived of
a good many entries.             Per contra, however, it occasionally happens
that denizens of the town resort to the country for the completion of
the    nuptial    tie.    During the Glasgow Fair holidays, for example,
many young couples, whose banns have been previously published
in Glasgow, go         " down the water,"        as  it is termed, for the purpose
of being married.
    Several of the northern             registrars have referred to the cost                    of
rural iceddiwjs        as one of the causes         of the ceremony taking place

G2G                    Proceedings     of the   Royal Society
 elsewhere.       Thus, little more than two years ago, in his return               for
 the quarter ending December, the registrar of a Ross-shire                    parish
reported     that " the    marriages    are becoming fewer every year,             but
some belonging to the parish are married               in the low-country      towns
                                                                "
 to avoid the       expense   of a   '
                                       Highland wedding.'            In  the return
 for the same quarter, an Inverness-shire registrar               stated that " the
excessive      expense connected      with rural weddings, to which all           and
sundry must be invited, induces parties to take advantage of their
proximity       to the   town of Inverness, and have the ceremony                per
formed there, where it can be done on a cheaper scale."
    The circumstance of the residence           of a favourite clergyman       being
in   a different parish from that of the domicile of the parties fre
quently accounts for the limited number of entries in the marriage
register.      The registrar of one of the districts of Dundee             reported,
a  few years ago, that comparatively few marriages were recorded by
him, because the houses of the favourite ministers for performing
the ceremony        of marriage were situated beyond the bounds of his
district.     In  the return for the same quarter, the registrar of          Kirkin
tilloch   stated that of sixteen couples whose             banns had been pro
claimed in that parish, only three were married in                  it ; and in   the
case of one of the districts of Greenock,             with   a population of not
less than      15,000 (?), about the same period, the total number of
marriages      registered   during the year seldom           exceeded    thirty,   on
account of most of the residences              of the officiating clergy, as well
as   the chapels      of the Episcopalians        and Roman Catholics,         being
situated in adjoining         parishes.      Towards     the end of       1878,   the
registrar of       St Clement's     district,    Dundee,     made    the following
announcement in one of his quarterly returns : — " The death of the
liev. George Gillillan will cause a decrease in the number of mar
riages registered      in this district,   as,  from his popularity among the
labouring classes, he was called on to perform the marriage ceremony
oftener    than any other Protestant             minister   in Dundee."        Occa
sionally the figures of suburban marriage registers are augmented by
the circumstance of the residences              of some of the incumbents of
city   charges      being at a little distance       from    their   cures.    Thus,
the registrar of Cathcart recently reported that his marriages                   were
in   excess,    "owing chiefly     to the residence       of Glasgow clergymen
being in that parish, and the marriage              ceremony frequently taking
place in the minister's house."

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                               627
    As in the      case of births, the relative       numbers of bachelors and
spinsters     materially      affect  the matrimonial      market.       Thus, since
1870      the   registrar    of    a  small   Inverness-shire    parish    has twice
reported      a  blank marriage register at the close of the                year,    the
cause ungallantly assigned by him being the " undue proportion of
old maids      I"    Very similar results, however,        are  found     even where
swains     are abundant.         The registrar of an insular parish in Argyll
shire very recently reported that the only marriage during an entire
quarter was that of              a tradesman     from   the south    ;   adding     that
" though there is        a large number     of native bachelors, the inducements
to marry appear to          be awanting."
     III.   Deaths. — For many           reasons,    more or less       obvious,     the
 mortality returns present even greater contrasts than those appli
 cable to births and marriages.              Speaking generally, the number of
 deaths is materially influenced by the density            of the population ; but
 this circumstance has been             so   frequently adverted to, that it is
 unnecessary to produce any confirmatory                 evidence.*      The normal
 mortality of      a closely-packed      population    may, however, be sensibly
 lessened by the judicious introduction of sanitary improvements                  ;  and
 during the last twenty           years many very    gratifying results have been
 exhibited in      some of our largest cities.        In  many country districts,
 however, where the blessings of pure air and abundant                     space have
 been vouchsafed, we frequently find that a deficient or faulty water-
 supply, inattention         to cleanliness and ventilation,      or the toleration
  of nuisances in the immediate vicinity of human dwellings,                   are the
  means of largely augmenting the number of deaths.                    In  such a city
  as  Edinburgh, which, for the purposes of the Eegistration                  Acts,    is
  divided into five districts, very striking differences appear in their
  respective mortality returns.           It cannot, of course, be expected that
  the ratio of deaths should be the same in the district of St Giles,
  embracing      as   it   does    many of the most crowded and insanitary
  sections of the city, as         in that of St George, which is largely com
  posed of the abodes of the wealthy, with their various advantageous
     * The numbers of births and marriages are also considerably
                                                                          augmented by
  the density of the population, being highest in the eight principal towns, next
  highest in the large towns, lower in the small towns, and lowest of all in the
  rural districts.   Some interesting illustrative details will be found in the Fif
  teenth   Annual   Report   of the Registrar-General, applicable to the year 1869.

628                      Proceedings    of tlie Royal      Society
conditions, or in that of Newington,            where the proportion        of inhabi
tants to the area which they occupy is so much smaller than                     in any
of the other districts.
    I have already       referred to the increase of what may be termed the
natural     mortality of any particular district by the existence of a
hospital or infirmary within its bounds, and, in like manner, the
number of deaths is considerably increased by large lunatic asylum*
and powhouses, in both of which the mortality is abnormally high.
In   a single       summer quarter, not many years ago,               in one of     the
districts     of Greenock, no fewer than fifteen of the deaths in                   the
infirmary were of persons belonging to an adjoining parish.                     About
the same period, in        a Mid-Lothian parish, ten of the sixty-six          persons
 whose deaths had been recorded were lunatics or paupers from other
 localities.      The mortality of such districts         as Bridgeton     (Glasgow),
 St Giles' (Edinburgh), St Mary's (Dundee), Larbert (Stirlingshire),
and many others, is largely augmented by the existence of hospitals,
infirmaries, and other public institutions.                 In referring to the cir
 cumstance of the deaths being above the average, the registrar of
 Stirling, in his return for the third quarter of 1878, explained that
 the mortality of the district was considerably increased by the
 presence     of the Combination Poorhouse (embracing several parishes),
 the Royal Infirmary for the county, the Military Hospital,                   <$:c    A
 similar augmentation is frequently found in                 some  of the most salu
 brious country districts, which are habitually resorted to by delicate
 persons     in search     of health, such      as   Rothesay,    Crieff,  Grantown,
 Forres, &c.        Nearer home, we find that the exceptionally              low mor
 tality of the district         of Newington (already referred            to) is con
 siderably increased by the deaths of invalids temporarily resident at
 Morningside,        in  consequence    of the genial climate of that favoured
 locality.
     Weather, of course, exercises         a potent     influence on the mortality
 returns    in every corner of the kingdom.             The old proverb, " A green
  Yule makes       a  fat kirkyard," has long been disproved by the reports
 of the Registrar-General.           When the weather is unseasonably mild,
 as  during the past winter,            sickness     frequently    prevails,  bat the
 mortality      is materially    lessened.     On the other hand, the marked
 effect  of   a   severe winter upon the lives of the old, the young,              and
 the    delicate     has   been    repeatedly    illustrated    by   the   Registrar's

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                             629
  returns.     During the     ten years ending 1870 the coldest month was
  January,     when    the   deaths,   amounting      to 69,206,      reached their
  maximum, while the smallest number occurred in September, viz.,
  50,342.     On the other hand, during the six preceding          years (1  855-60),
  both February and March proved colder months than January, and
  produced the highest          mortality,   viz., 36,917     and    36,525     deaths
  respectively.     As in the later period, however, the mortality                 was
 lowest     in September, when the deaths numbered 27,110.                        The
 effect of great heat upon bowel complaints and              kindred    diseases has
 been repeatedly pointed         out    The relative deaths, however,         are not
 generally     sudden,    the    sufferers   frequently    lingering     for   several
 weeks ; and accordingly many of the deaths are not recorded                  till the
 autumn.       The influence of      season    upon phthisis     and several other
 ailments is more or less marked ; while in the case of diseases of
 the digestive     and urinary organs the same effect is comparatively
 imperceptible.
    In Ireland and elsewhere the scarcity and consequent high price
 of food has frequently exercised a powerful influence on the national
mortality ; but in Scotland, at least during recent years, no such
effect   has been noticed.          On the contrary, while in 1868, with
wheat at 63s. 9d. per quarter and potatoes at 137s. 6d. per ton, tho
deaths     amounted     to only 69,416, during the following year, when
wheat had fallen to 48s.          2d.  and potatoes     to 99s.     6d., the deaths
reached      the high number         of 75,875.      Results    somewhat similar
were presented      in the mortality tables applicable to the years 1866
and 1867, when prices considerably differed.
    It is hardly necessary to refer to the influence of epidemics on the
public mortality, more especially cholera, smallpox, influenza, scarlet
fever, and measles,      from most of which we have been comparatively
free for a good many years.
    Lastly, the nature of the occupations of             the inhabitants      of any
district has no inconsiderable          effect  upon the number of deaths —
miners, fishermen, and the followers of other hazardous avocations
being specially      subject to untimely        ends.    In   consequence of the
frequent explosions        in coal-pits, or the results of        severe   gales, the
death    register of many a rural           parish, with a moderate average
mortality,     is obliged    to be largely augmented.          Thus, of tho 247
deaths    recorded    in the parish of Blantyre in the last quarter of

G30                 Proceedings   of  the  Boyal Society
1877, no fewer than 206 were caused          by the explosion at the local
colliery on the 22nd October of that        year.    Again, in the summer
quarter of 1871, 17 of the 25 deaths recorded in the small Ross-
shire parish of Avoch were caused           by drowning,      3 men having
been   lost on the 16th of May when dredging for oysters;             while    4
men and 10 women, all belonging           to the fishing    population,   were
drowned     by the upsetting of an overcrowded          coble.    Of the 147
deaths registered in the parish of Eyemouth, Berwickshire, in the
last quarter of 1881, no fewer than         129 were those      of the unfor
tunate fishermen who perished in the fearful          storm on the 14th of
October of that year.       They were all in the prime of life,          73  of
them being married.
   Several other disturbing    influences might have been indicated in

                      Marriage   Seasons   in England.
    " In London   the close of the season among the higher classes is         a
matrimonial     epoch ; among     the working classes        the festivals   of
Whitsuntide and Christmas          and the season      of Lent exert      some
influence, so    do the   terms    of service, which vary         in different
counties.    The geniality   of spring is perceptible     ; but Lincolnshire
is the only county in which the spring weddings exceed the autumn
weddings in number.        The accumulations of autumn supply          a store
of food, and the harvest     wages   of the young swains in agricultural
districts are often wisely invested in the furniture of a cottage :
it has already been shown that workpeople are influenced in
marriage by economic conditions and proapecta
    " It might be supposed that marriages take place indifferently on
any day of the week.        But it is not so. Few marriages are cele
brated on a Friday.       Now Friday was in former times the day
which would      be especially   devoted to these celebrations,          as   is
implied    by the names Dies Veneris of the Latins, and Friday, the
day of the Saxon goddess Fritpi.

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                      631
     " This day       was    chosen by the early Church, perhaps partly                        in
opposition to Paganism, as a day for carnal mortification.                              It   was
the day of the crucifixion              of Christ   ; and hence the festive             Friday
of    the     Saxons,       and   the    day   especially    under    the    star which
astrologers      held       was most fortunate,         fell into the category of
'unlucky days.'             Seamen      will not sail, women will not wed, on
a    Friday    so     willingly    as on other days         of the week.       The Sun,
Moon, and Saturn have gained by this silly superstition.                           Half the
weddings are celebrated on                 Sunday     and    Monday;        Saturday          has
more than       its   average     number, and in the southern as well as the
northern       counties the Saturday marriages are the most numerous.
It   has been suggested           that the pocket of the workman who has no
account at the bank               for savings,      and lives on weekly            wages,       is
often empty on Friday, which lays his mind open to gloomy omens,
and indisposes          him, while on Saturday              he is exhilarated           by the
money       which he throws into circulation on the three following                      days.
Economy         of time is an alleged motive for Sunday weddings." —
Report       of the   Registrar-General        of England,    1S66.
     " In England and Wales              as a whole, and also         in the individual
counties without exception,               there are fewer marriages in the first
quarter than in any other.                  The maximum quarter, both in the
entire country          and, with three exceptions, in each county, is the
fourth ; while between the second and third                       there is but little
difference, the second, however, having                     in the long run the pre
ference.       The three counties which             are exceptions to the otherwise
universal rule of the maximum falling in the Christmas quarter are
Herefordshire,          Shropshire,      and, in a notable degree, Lincolnshire,
in    each     of which,        on an average       of seven years     (1875-81), the
maximum fell in the second and not                      in the fourth quarter.               Dis
regarding such exceptions, for which local explanations are probably
to be found, the predominance                  of the fourth quarter         is,   as   a    rule,
much more marked in purely agricultural                     counties than elsewhere                ;
presumably because in agricultural                  districts the fourth quarter              isa
period of comparative leisure, whereas in industrial or, speaking
generally, in urban districts there              is   much less distinction between
one season of the year and another as regards occupation.

  and   it was   selected      because,       as a matter of fact, the            distribution of
  its marriages by quarters was found                    to correspond very closely             with
  the distribution in the country at large.                      It will  be noticed       that the
  months in which most marriages occurred were December, October,
  April, and     J  une.      The     excesses     in December, April, and June were
  due to the festival          periods of Christmas,              Easter, and Whitsuntide
  respectively     ;   while the         excess      in October marks the period                    of
  leisure, and of cash in the labourer's                       pocket, which follows              the
  close   of harvest-time.              This     excess    in October would doubtless
 have been still more marked had a purely agricultural country been
 selectedj; for in the completely urban population                          of Manchester          n--»

Whitsuntide marriages, in June, were much                       more    numerous than
the Easter marriages, in         April    ;  whereas in the county the reverse
was the case, a difference which may he attributed to the fact that
the agricultural        population      was     busy in   June with the        hay.    In
both   town      and     county   the marriages in            May were below          the
average number         in the other months, May being for               some reason or
other very generally regarded as               a   month of ill-omen       for wedlock.
The feeling against marrying in May is not easy of explanation.
It is not common to all countries. On the contrary, in Germany,
in Denmark, and in Switzerland this month                     appears from the table
to be a favourite time for weddings.                  That it is attributable to May
         '                            '
being      the Virgin's month            seems       scarcely compatible      with the
fact that in Catholic France, where such                 a cause   would be expected
to have much more influence than in Protestant England, the May
marriages are slightly in excess.                 Not impossibly the custom may
be a survival from Roman            times     ;   for in ancient Rome also it was
deemed to be unlucky to wed in May, it is said, because the Lemuria,
or Festival of the Departed Souls, was held in that month.

4.   Experiments           on  the Chief Disinfectants                 of Commerce,
        with a view of ascertaining their Power of Destroying
        the Spores of the Anthrax bacillus.                          By A. Wynter
        Blyth, Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst.
        Communicated by Prof. Turner.
   The following paper gives the result of a considerable number of
experiments made in 1883, the object of which was to ascertain
whether any of the disinfectants              in popular     use had a   " germicidal "
action or not.
   Very few have distinguished               between the action of a germicide
and that of         a disinfectant.         If    fungus spores     are  steeped    for a
certain     time    in   some   powerful         chemical    solution,   and then, on
being perfectly freed from the solution by washing or otherwise,
placed in any soil whatever, neither grow nor exhibit any life
manifestation,       we are justified        in saying that the        spore   has been

63   i                      Proceedings         of the Royal      Society
destroyed, that its life has departed, and that the chemical solution
is a true germicide ; while                  if,   on the contrary, although           while in
the      solution         the spore did not grow,            yet,    on being       placed         on
suitable soil, there             is   either feeble or strong growth, in that case,
although the solution may have disinfectant                         properties,   it   is   not     a
germicide.
     Much       more       has        been done       to   show     the    disinfectant          than
the       germicidal        properties       of substances.         The labours of Angus
Smith,         Crace Calvert,           Bucholz,      and other workers          have studied
the       inhibition        of fungoid          growth     and      of     putrefaction,          the
destruction of odours, and the decomposition and fixing of noxious
gases;         so   that     further observations           on    the     same    lines     would
scarcely do more than confirm facts generally accepted.
  But the action of chemical agencies on those minute particulate
substances which are regarded as the materien morbi, or Beeds of
zymotic         and parasitic          diseases,    have been but little investigated.
Here      is   a    field for investigation           of almost illimitable extent,               but
nevertheless one in which we have already firm paths and footholds
across      the morass of              theory      and conjecture,       as,   foi example, in
Gerlach and Franck's experiments                       on the virus of glanders, Ledra
on that of ovine variola, and Braidwood                      and Vacher on the lymph
of vaccine.

     In    my       own     experiments      I      have   followed       out    in principle,

   The advantages just cited,       as  well as the experiments        of Koeh,
were sufficient to induce me to also select         the Anthrax baciUm for
the purpose of ascertaining the relative value         of disinfectants.
   Cultivation of Anthrax. — Dr Klein placed at my disposal a small
supply of Anthrax bacilli in the spore state, and            I had the advan
tage of studying his admirable paper
                                             *
                                                (Eleventh Annual Report of
the Local Government Board), in which he has given full detail*
of an improved method of cultivation.
   A  large air-bath was set up, and all flasks, beakers, and pipettes-
heated for many hours to about 500° Fahr.                Similarly the cotton
wool used was disinfected by        a  dry heat, the heat being carried         to-
nearly the singeing point
   As in Dr Klein's method, pork as lean as possible, after suitable
division, was boiled in water, the broth filtered through a sieve, and
then the supernatant fat separated by means of a separating funneL.
The broth   was next accurately measured, and 10 c.c. or 50         cc, titrated
by  d. n. soda, using as an indicator phenol-phthalein.         In this way    the
precise acidity was known, and from the data thus obtained                 it was
easy to exactly neutralise the remaining bulk.            After neutralisation
with   soda, the  broth was again boiled for      some time, and then     filtered
hot into    a previously   sterilised    flask.   From this stock flask the
cultivation flasks were charged with from 20 to 30            c.c. of the broth.
   The cultivation flasks had bulbs of about 70 c.c. capacity, the
bottoms     were flat, and the necks from four to five inches long,
and narrow     ; they were charged       by means of      a sterilised   pipette,
and then plugged for     at least three inches      with  a cotton- wool plug.
After plugging, the flasks were immersed in             a  water-bath, so that
only about an inch of the neck              was  above the surface, and tho
water kept boiling for many hours.              This method answered very
well, and     seemed   to me an improvement            on the usual plan of
directly boiling the broth in the flask.         After this  process the flasks
thus charged were placed in an incubator thirty at                 a time, and
kept for three days and nights at the temperature of the blood.
Those that remained clear were then considered sterilised, those
showing the least turbidity were rejected.

Anthrax Cultivation," by E. Klein, M.D., F.R.S. Supplement containing
the Report of the Medical Officer.

    The incubator was         a copper air-bath supplied        with   a Page's     gas
regulator    ;   it was found to automatically regulate the temperature
within half       a degree.
   On similar principles         Dr Klein's " Pork-gelatin " was prepared.
   I also    hit upon    a  plan of albuminizing a broth, which seems likely
to be useful.        A  fresh hen's egg was taken, a very small hole drilled
in the shell, and then         a pipette previously sterilised      thrust into this
hole through         the    membrane into the albumin,           and the albumin
sucked up, and then added to the broth, by momentarily                       remov
ing   the cotton-wool         plug, and allowing the required quantity               to
flow in    ; a  liquid is obtained by      these   simple means, which in          the
majority       of   instances    keeps fresh     without odour        or  turbidity,
although      submitted      to a cultivation temperature for days, and               is
more    like   a  fluid  tissue  than any cultivation fluid hitherto recom
mended.         It  seems    pretty certain    that   so long as the      shell   and
membrane of what is popularly called a fresh egg is intact, there
are no parasitic germs         within.
   To infect any of           these  soils, a glass rod was drawn          out very
thin, the end tipped with sealing wax, and to the hot sealing                    wax
a  minute     fluff of cotton-wool was made to          adhere    to the wax   ; and
this rod was plunged into the anthrax holding fluid, so as only                      to
immerse the sealing             wax;   having    thus charged the threads or
" fluff," the plug of         one of the flasks was loosened,         the thin rod
passed    rapidly down, and broken off short against the bottom of                the
flask, at the same time again plugging firmly               ;  in this way the in
fecting of a flask was accomplished so rapidly that the accidental
admixture of air germs was reduced to a minimum.
   To ascertain the germicide power of a disinfectant, the little thin
rod, with its small bead of sealing wax, and the "fluff" which had
been    contaminated        by anthrax, was placed in the disinfectant             for
certain known periods of time, then removed and plunged                          into
strong alcohol, into ether, or into previously boiled distilled water,
according to the composition           of the disinfectant, so as to dissolve
out as far as possible the film of the disinfectant                adhering  to   the
wool.       This having been accomplished,            a flask    of broth   was in
fected in the manner already described, and the flask submitted
to the heat of the incubator.               If  the broth     remained     perfectly
clear, then the inference          was   that the disinfectant       had killed th*

spores ; any growth               or turbidity was               submitted         to microscopical
examination.
  A few experiments were made after the manner of Koch on
nutrient gelatin, but it was not found so convenient as fluids.
Although the microscope                     was   in     each    case employed,              I   think all
those who           have worked at the subject                   will    agree     with      me, that       in
perfectly normal cults, a little practice enables the anthrax                                          cult to
be distinguished           by the naked eye from all other cults whatever.
    Carbolic        Acid. — The        carbolic acids experimented                  upon were Cal
vert's       No.    1, and the    dark carbolic acid of             commerce,         containing tar
oils and much foreign matter ; Calvert's                           carbolic acid powder was
also tested.
    Calvert's Carbolic Acid No.                   1. —   A   1   per cent, solution              in water
of this acid was made, and the anthrax                           spores    soaked in             it,   in the
way detailed and then cultivated in the pork broth.

Hence        1   per cent, of carbolic acid seemed to have no influence on
anthrax spores, not even delaying the growth, for no decided differ
ence     between the disinfected cult and a cult not disinfected                                        could

   Gremjlic  Acid. — A    25 per cent, solution of cresylic acid          in  alcohol
acting on anthrax       spores for twenty-four          hours only delayed the
growth.     On the     "fluff" being placed in           a sterilised broth, there
was no   turbidity for twenty-four hours          ; while in the " control " the
growth was evident and strong           ;  afterwards      a  few threads slowly
developed.     P>y  the end of four days the         liquid   was quite turbid.
   Similar results were obtained by cultivating on "gelatin-pork."

  Since it          seemed improbable                that merely sprinkling the powder
on the infected           "fluff" would           reach all the       spores, the        powder was
added in weighed quantities to water, and was also made into a
paste with water, and in the paste the glass rod containing the
infected rods allowed to remain for various periods of time.
  Calvert's            Pink Carbolic Acid Powder, in wafer                     5   per   cent. — The
spores       acted on by this disinfectant                    for twenty-four            hours were
removed and cultivated on gelatin-pork as well                          as   in broth.      In       each
case   growth,         as compared        with       a comparison cult, was delayed              ;   but
by the end of four days the growth was luxuriant.
  On making              a paste      with    water, and allowing        the spores to rest in
the paste,         even    so    long    as     twenty-four    hours, no germicide effect
was noticeable.             As     before, the growth was delayed.
   Other carbolic acid powders were                         obtained from various firms,
and tested,         with no      better result.
   Liquor Carbonis               Detergens.      — This    is a solution of certain coal-tar
products in spirit.              It   forms with water an emulsion.
   Added to water in the proportion of                        5 per cent.,     it had but     feeble
influence         in preventing         the subsequent growth of anthrax.
   A     10 per cent, solution, acting for four hours, distinctly                           retarded
growth       ;   for   the spores, whether on gelatin-pork or in the broth, did
 not commence             developing for twenty-four hours.
   Undilated " liquor carbonis                        detergens,"     acting for four hours,
 arrested future growth.
   Jeyes' Fluid.          — Apparently           a   solution of various principles derived
 from coal-tar.           It    forms a thick emulsion with water.
   It     was necessary            in this instance, after soaking the infected
 threads         in the liquid, to       free    it from the thick emulsion by alcohol.
   Four experiments showed that in                        a 5 per cent,       solution    — that       is,
 such    a   solution     as    in practice might be used —            it    was not an eflicient
 germicide.
    Jeyes'        Powder        bears    the     same     relation to Jeyes' liquid as tho
 carbolic acid powders to carbolic acid.
    The powder was made into                         a   paste with    water,      but seemed to
 have no definite effect on the anthrax spores.                          Growth after twenty-
 four hours' cultivation                was active.

    Pixene. — This is a preparation which is said to be                    a  solution      of
the principles of wood-tar.           It  has a strong empyreumatic odour, and
forms an emulsion with water.                Undiluted      pixene seems to destroy
the anthrax spores         if allowed    td act on them for twenty-four hours.
    A 10 per cent, solution in water, acting on the spores                    for  twenty-
four hours, delayed gowth, but it was ultimately active.
    In this    case, as in    all the tar products, it was found             necessary to
be very careful to                                  "
                          completely free the fluff" from the                disinfectant.
In my earlier experiments with pixene, when I did not wash the
spores sufficiently, I gave a higher value to it than it really pos
sessed.        This   was    owing to the inhibitory power which                       small
quantities      of the tar products exercise            on the growth of anthrax
when actually present.
    " Sanita8" Fluid. — The fluid               is  said    to contain       peroxide       of
hydrogen, thymol, camphoric acid, and terebene.
    Spores soaked in the fluid for twenty-four                 hours afterwards        grew
freely when placed on suitable soils.
    Sauitas Emulsion.         — The   spores    placed    in   sanitas    emulsion      were
 delayed in growth, for there was no development for twenty-four
 hours.       In forty-eight hours      there was a feeble growth.             Ultimately
 it was luxuriant.
     Sanitns Oil. — This gave entirely similar results.
     Sanitas Poicdcr         had   no influence whatever on the growth                      of
 anthrax.
     Morgan's      Fluid,     which   contains sulphate of copper and                   zinc,
 with other ingredients in solution, was experimented with in                             the
 diluted and undiluted form           ;   but in neither did        it  seem to have the
 slightest influence on the life of the spore.
     Sulphate      of Iron, which         has    been   recommended           to   disinfect
 typhoid       excrete,    was    experimented        with     in    like   manner.          A
 saturated solution          was   made     by    boiling    a    large   quantity      with
 water, and then allowing it to cool.
     Here again in no case was any destructive influence on the                           life
 of the     spores observed.
     Sulphate     of Copper       was also dissolved, and made                of strength*
 from     5 per cent,    up to saturation     ;  but the spores were iu no               way
 attacked, although allowed to remain in the liquid for twenty-four

  Chloride of Zinc. — Koch has given a very unfavourable verdict
with regard       to zinc chloride                  in one of his experiments.                           Anthrax
spores grew well after a month's sojourn in a 5 per cent, solution.
  Experiments            were made with solutions of                        1   per cent., 5 per cent.                ,
and 25 per cent, solutions.
  I   found the short                  steeping       of an hour in             a 1 per         cent     solution
stimulating       the subsequent growth of the spores, the vegetation at
the end     of twenty-four               hours being more active than in the com
parison liquid.
  Steeping the spores for twenty-four hours in                                   a 5 per cent,           solution
did not seem to exert any influence on their development.
  Steeping the spores in                     a 25 per cent,         solution arrested the life of
the spores,     that        is,   so   far   as    artificial cultivation            is    concerned.
   Chloride of Zinc and Thymol. — Thymol                                        was       shaken up with
water, and the thymol water thus obtained used                                             as   a    solvent for
zinc chloride, the solutions being made up to                                   1,   5,   and 25 per cent,
strength.      In       each case the              behaviour was the same as in that of
the pure solutions                of zinc chloride,              the addition             of thymol in no
way adding to or diminishing                         the action.
  Perchloride           of Iron. — Various strengths of                          a    solution of funic
chloride    iu water were made from                         1   up to 25 per cent.               ;   but in no
single case did         a             hours' steeping of the spores destroy
                            twenty-four
their vitality.          With the stronger solution, the vegetation was late,
but ultimately          luxuriant.            With      1       per cent,       solution          the develop
ment was       more         rapid       than,       usual, the growth                being,         as   it   wero,
stimulated.
   Terdinne.    —A          sample       of terebene, said to be pure, had no effect
on the spores       ;   but on examination the so-called terebene was found
to contain    70    per cent, of unchanged turpentine.
  Another sample,                 which       was      certainly        pure, gave              better results.
Npores     soaked       twenty-four               hours in this terebene did not grow in
sterilised broth.

10 per cent.,     experimented with                    as   in    the   former case, delayed the
growth, but     it      was ultimately              luxuriant.
  The terebene which seemed to have germicidal powers was further

      Mercuric Chloride. — A                1   percent, solution acting for twenty -four

  3. Second Note on the Eemarkable                   Sunsets.      By Mr John
                                      Aitken.
    When     I communicated     my first note on this subject on the 21st
of January last, the only definite conclusion             I had then arrived at
was that the very remarkable and            brilliant colour   effects, lately seen
in the heavens at sunrise and sunset, were due to the presence of an
unusual amount         of dust at the time floating in our atmosphere.
This atmospheric dust acts as a sifting medium, breaks up the white
light into its       components,     and reflects all the different          colours
to us from different parts of the sky.
   Owing to the cloudy       state  of our northern skies, and         to the ever-
varying condition of our atmosphere,             it was found Very difficult to
follow the successive colour changes              in such   a way as to enable
me to form        anything   like   a   satisfactory    explanation      of all the
phenomena.         Since coming, however, to the south of France,                and
seeing  all the different sunset      effects repeat themselves evening after
evening     in cloudless skies,     I   have been enabled to form          a  clearer
idea  of how the different     effects are produced) and from the observa
tions  made under these more favourable                conditions,    I  shall now
attempt    to give what    appears    to be the explanation of some of the
principal phenomena of these Very remarkable and brilliant sunsets.
    Though      it was the month of March            before  I saw these     sunsets
under   the more favourable          conditions,     and the brilliancy of the
display had very greatly          diminished,       yet sufficient    remained     to
enable the different      colour Changes to be followed,          and   I  was still
able to detect marked differences          in the brilliancy of the      effects  on
different evenings.       Briefly   stated,   the following is something like
the order      in which the different phenomena followed each other,
evening     after evening, in these cloudless skies, the only difference
being   in the brilliancy of the colours on the different evenings.
During the day the snn was surrounded by an unnsual amount of
 white   light or glare. As it descended, this glare gradually in
 creased in brilliancy and extent ; but while it was still an hour
 from  setting, no colours, save blue, were anywhere visible in the
 heavens,     and   the horizon all round was white.             As the sun was

 648                   Proceedings     of the Royal       Society
about to set, the lower part of the western horizon became tinged
with yellow,      which deepened to orange as the orb touched the
horizon.     After it had sunk below the horizon, the band of colour
in the  west deepened       and widened.          The yellow, which when first
visible was close to the horizon* after a time rose higher, while the
colour on the horizon gradually deepened to orange and at last to
red, the    upper limit    of the colours at the same time rising higher
and higher       in the   heavens.       The      amount    to which    the colour
deepened,    and the height to which it rose, varied from evening                   to
evening.
    For  some    minutes after the sun had set, nothing               very remark
able appeared       in the sky.       Overhead it was blue, and the bhw
 gradually changed through          white      to a dull reddish colour on the
horizon,    in the north, south,           and east;      in the west the blu?
changed by imperceptible           degrees       from    blue   into white, which
melted into yellow,        and the yellow in turn deepened             into  orange
and red on the horizon.           But on most evenings, within a quarter
of an hour        after the sun      had      set,  a  very remarkable      reddisk
glow    made its appearance high              up in the western sky.          When
this aurora-like glow first      became visible,        its upper edge would       be
about 40° above the horizon, and extended downwards to about                     15"
from the horizon.         The colours of this glow            were  quite different
from any      of   those on     the horizon.          There    the  colours   varied
from yellow through          orange   to red;       but this upper glow       was •
very different red from that on the horizon             — perhaps crimson is the
colours to which it most nearly approached.                   As time progressed,
this glow gradually descended, till at last it merged into the sunset
 colours on the horizon, and the two bands melted into one.                     This
upper glow generally took about 10 or 15 minutes, from the time it
was   distinctly visible,      to descend and          become     absorbed   in  the
horizon colours.       Owing to the perspective, its Upper            edge  seemed
to descend     more     quickly than the lower, which              made   th» glow
appear to become narrower as it approached the horizon.
   After the sun had      been from 20 to 30 minutes under the horiroc,
nothing    remarkable was visible        ;  the upper glow having sunk into
the horizon colours, the heavens had again much the same appear
ance they had before the upper glow began,                 only somewhat darker.
But   a   few   minutes     after   this    upper     glow    had disappeared,      a

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                                       640
second      made     its appearance.                  This second upper glow was not,
however, confined to the west,                       but the whole heavens glowed with a
strange      reddish light, of very much the same tone of colour as the
first upper glow.           This second                   one generally          seemed      to attain its
maximum first in the east, then all over the sky, a short time after
which it died away, and the sky took up its usual night appearance.
Only a very few observations of this second glow were obtained, as
it was       only on        a      few     evenings           that      its     appearance        and        dis
appearance      were       sufficiently          distinct for the hour to                    be    correctly
noted.       The time after              sunset,         when     it   appeared and disappeared,
cannot      therefore be given with any accuracy.                                  I   may state,        how*
ever, that     it   appeared            within       a     few minutes after the first upper
glow      had vanished, perhaps about 30 or 35 minutes                                       after sunset,
and      it did not last long.              It       is obvious that the times here given
of the first and second                   glows           only refer to           the particular         cases
observed.       A    month or two earlier, when there was more dust in
the air, there is every reason                       for supposing that both the first and
second glows         would have continued much longer after sunset,                                           as
there would then be plenty of dust                           in the higher regions to sift the
rays, also to reflect the red ones, and the sun would                                     thus continue
to   shine on the dust to a later hour.                                 It    is necessary        for   me to
state that the position                 from which the observations were made was
such that the sun           did not         set on the sea, but over land,                          and that
the land was low,               and the position                     of observation          high enough
for the sun to be seen down to the true horizon.
     The conclusions at which                    I    have arrived             are — 1st, that the first
upper glow is produced by the direct                              rays of the sun illuminating
the particles       of matter suspended in the atmosphere                              ; and 2nd, that
the      brilliant western horizon light                     i8   the source of illumination of
the second upper glow.
     I   shall now attempt to state the manner in which all the different
successive colour          effects           The sun's rays, in passing
                                         are produced.
through      our atmosphere, there encounter innumerable multitudes of
very      small dust particles.                  Some           of     these     particles    are       so   ex
tremely small that they can stop and scatter                                   only the rays of small
 wave length; that                is,   those        of    the violet end of the spectrum.
The result of       this    is,   that the blue light                  is   stopped and reflected in
 every direction, while the rays                      of the red end of the spectrum                          are

650                          Proceedings           of the Royal Society
allowed       to pass        on.        The    amount to which the rays of the violet
end are thrown out depends on the number                                     of small           particles
encountered by them.                     It   is generally supposed that water vapour,
by absorbing            the rays of the violet end of the spectrum,                                has    a
somewhat similar              effect      on the light passing through                    it.      If   so,
the water vapour in our atmosphere will tend to deepen the red,
and so intensify the effect of the dust
     The     reason      why       a     great amount               of dust in our atmosphere
should give such brilliant sunset effects, is that                               it   causes     a more
perfect sifting action on the sun's rays in the outer strata of oar
atmosphere,            and    provides         a   greater amount of particles                   in     the
lower strata large enough to reflect the red rays.                                If   there were        rm
fine particles in the upper strata, the sunset effect would be whiter,
and    if   there were no large particles in either upper or lower strata,
then no such sunset effect would be possible.                                If       our atmosphere
were perfectly free from dust( the light would                              simply pass through
it into      space      without revealing                 itself,    and   the   moment         the     t*»
dipped below the horizon total darkness would follow.  The length
of our twilight, therefore, depends on the amount of dust in some
form or other in our atmosphere*                         and the height to which the dust
extends.           A    great amount of dust in the higher regions of our
atmosphere would              fully account for the greatly prolonged twilight
we enjoyed while these sunset effects were at their brightest.
     While the sun is still high above the horizon, its rays have                                        to
penetrate but little more than the depth of our atmosphere, and
they are subjected to but a slight sifting action by the dust, the
colour of the light being little changed by the small amount                                             of
blue thrown out of                it,   before   it     arrives at the surface of the earth.
But    as the sun approaches the horizon, its                         light has to      pass through
a   rapidly increasing extent of our atmosphere, and its rays are sub
jected to     a   proportionate increase in the amount of the sifting actios                              ;
so that by the time the sun                        is   on the horizon, the sifting action
is   so great that       all the rays of short                wave     length are stopped and
scattered,        and only those              of the red end of the spectrum                       reach
the earth      ;   hence          the illumination of any object                      lighted by the
direct rays alone            is   yellow, orange, or red, according to the amount
of sifting that has taken place.

through   which the rays have to pass, before arriving at our
position, still goes on increasing ; and though the rays cannot now
come direct to us on the surface of the earth, yet they pass through
our atmosphere overhead, and illuminate any particles large enough
that may be floating there. But not only do the sun's rays pass
through         a   greater    extent       of    our      atmosphere               when      the sun      is
below the horizon, but                as the rays are              then at a tangent to the
earth's surface, they have to pass through                              a    greater proportion           of
air near the        earth ; and       in that region there                  are,    in addition       to the
large particles, more of the very fine small-wave-scattering                                    particles,
as well as more water vapour, than in the upper regions of our
atmosphere.            The    rays,    therefore, that pass have the                           colours    of
small wave length more perfectly sifted out of them, and the light
tramsmitted          is deeper red.
     When       we look towards the north, south, and east soon after sun-
Bet, we see that the sky near the horizon is                         of      a     dull reddish colour.
This, is due to the sun's rays being deprived of all save their red, in
their     passage      horizontally     through          so much        of the atmosphere, and
these       red     rays    falling on the large particles                          low down in the
atmosphere illuminate               them with red light.                    This red light near the
horizon would            be much redder          if it   were not for the great amount of
blue light reflected to the particles from the sky overhead. As the
sun sinks, but before it ceases to shine on our atmosphere, the
temperature of the air begins to fall, and its cooling is accompanied
by an       increase       in the   size of the          particles          floating     in    it,   due to
water vapour condensing                    upon them.            The particles to the                    east
lose the sun first, and are                  thus coolest               and         the rays         in that
direction being best sifted, the red colour                      is ;   here more          distinct than
in the north or south.
     As the sun sinks lower, the particles overhead                                     get    larger and
better able to reflect the            red rays     ;     and the red colour at first visible
in   the east slowly rises, passes overhead, and descends                                     in the   west.
We cannot, however, see in the zenith with the unassisted
                                      it                                                         eye, and
it not till forms the first glow that becomes visible.
     is             it                                        it                                I      have,
however, been able by means of                     a   Nicol prism to detect the                 presence
of    the     red    glow overhead,              tracing    it   from            its    first appearance
in    the east,        and following        it     in its     passage              to   the west, long
before     it   became       visible to the unassisted eye in the western glow.

One reason           why the red light is not visible overhead, is that the
depth of the red reflecting stratum is not enough to stop oat the
great quantity of blue light coming from the sunlit air higher up                                                   ;
and as this blue light is complementary to the red of the afterglow,
the two combine, and cause                             the heavens to appear whitish, both
colours being destroyed                     ;    but the Nicol prism, by cutting out the
polarised light, reveals the red to the eye.                             By examining               the sky
overhead with the prism, it was                              always possible      to tell, before the
first afterglow in the west began, whether                             it woidd     be   bright or        not.
If   the red glow was not strong overhead when the polarised                                             light
was cut out, then the afterglow                              was sure to be poor.              From this
we see that the red seen in the east, shortly after sunset, rises and
passes overhead unseen,                         but again becomes           visible in the             aurors-
like glow in the            west.
     Another         reason      why    we see             this afterglow     in the west, though
we cannot           see    it with the unassisted                   eye overhead,        is,   that when
viewing        it   towards the horizon, we are looking obliquely into the
red stratum, and are thus receiving                              light from   a   greater depth of             it
than when looking upwards                         ;    we are therefore receiving                 a    greater
amount of red light, and the greater thickness also helps to block
out the blue light beyond;                            It   is   very evident, however, that this
does not explain                some    of the peculiarities in the visibility of                             the
first glow.           If   the first glow, as seen in the west,                       is     due to the
sifted rays of the sun falling on particles large enough to reflect the
red rays, thus producing in the atmosphere                              a   stratum of air             full    of
red glowing particles, then we naturally ask ourselves,                                    Why is not
this red light visible to the unassisted                            eye when       looking towards
the north, south, and east,                      as   well   as towards the west     t       If   at sunset
there     is   formed in the sky                 a    red stratum, we can image                it   so thin
as to be        invisible when looked through overhead, bat we should
expect      it      to be equally               brilliant in all directions,             at the saic*
elevation, or        if    it   is   more       brilliant in     one direction than        another, wc
should         expect the east, and hot the west, to be most                           brilliant at
sunset.         Or to put this difficulty in another way.                           Why     it that
                                                                                                  is
this brilliant upper glow                   is    visible only when viewed from
                                                                     certain                      a
direction      ?     To an observer placed to the north, south, or west oi                                      it,
it   is   quite invisible.             We know,                 for Instance, that       a     short tiraa
before      this upper glow was visible                           to us on any evening,                  then

                                of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84                                                   653
 was a similar glow to the south of us                        ;   and seen by observers to the
south-east of us ; and though we were looking into the sky where
the glow was, and at the same                          elevation          as they were, yet             it was
quite invisible to us.
        Two    explanations               suggest      themselves           to      account           for       this
peculiarity         in the glow.                One supposition              is,   that its brilliancy
        dependent in some way on the brightness                                  of    the sky behind
it is                                                                                                             is,
   ;     the other supposition,                 and by far the more                   probable one,
that     it   is   due to same peculiarity                 in the reflecting particles.                      The
glow being visible only on particles situated between                                            us    and the
sun, would seem to indicate that the particlea engaged in producing
that glow are not ordinary dust particles, which absorb and radiate
the light in all directions, but that this peculiar eflect produced                              is
 by the regular reflection of the sun's                           rays.      But      it   may be asked,
 Where         are the       necessary reflectors                 to come          from    1<    Now        it    is
obvious        that any small crystals floating                           in the air will, by the
reflection from their surfaces, produce this result.                                  All       examinations
of the volcanic dust lately colleoted from the atmosphere show
 that     a   great quantity of             it    is   composed of small glassy crystals.
An        abundance          of      such       crystals     would quite              account          for      the
peculiarity         in the visibility           o£ the first glow, as these crystals                        would
shine far mare brilliantly when placed between the observer and
the sun than in any other position. It now simply question as      is                       a
to whether there,     quantity of such small crystals sufficient to
                                is   a
produce this result.                     The evidence seems to indicate that there                               is;
if      so, then the       difficulty vanishes.              Mixed with            these crystals there
are also large quantities                   of ordinary           kinds of dust, and                  it   is    the
light      reflected       by the latter which principally causes the red glow
seen in the south, north, and east                           Bothkinds of dust                  are necessary
fully to explain all the phenomena.
        The first glow            looked as       if   it    stood vertically              in the western
heavens       ;    this, however,          is   an. effect    of perspective.               In    reality        we
 ¦were    looking into what              was practically       a   horizontal layer of mote-filled
air; and       as the sun got lower and lower the part of this layer reflecting
the red light, gradually moved westwards, which                                     gave    it    the appear
ance of moving downwards.                          From the high angle at which this first
glow was           seen,   it   could not be far from us, at least when                           it   was first
 visible — not         more than ten ox fifteen miles, perhaps much less.

 654                    Proceedings       of  the  Royal Society
    On all the evenings on which this first glow was distinct,                         I   ob
served a    thin film of silvery cloud, if cloud it could be called,                    form
or become visible over the western sky, just after the sun had dis
appeared.        It   was  rather curious that this filmy oloud seemed to
have     a definite boundary          underneath, its wavings or undulations
being quite distinct.           The peculiar silvery appearance             of this filmy
cloud struck me at the time, as             it had   a strange lustre about         it  ; but
it  was not   till  I considered the necessity        for crystalline reflectors fully
to explain the peculiarities           in the visibility of the first glow, that it
struok me these crystals would also explain the peculiar                            silvery
lustre of this haze           or cloud.       This crystalline      dust would            also
account for the, great brilliancy of the mid-day glare, accompanied
as   it was  with comparatively little white light at a distance from
the sun,    and with fair transparency in the other parts of the 6ky,
the orystals between         us and the sun reflecting more           light than       those
situated in other directions.
    So far    as    these   observations       have gone, no relation has               been
ileteoted    between       the brilliancy of          these   alter    glows      and the
humidity of the atmosphere, as given either by the spectroscope, or
by the wet and dry bulb, thermometers.                     The observations, so far
as    they go, rather        indicate     a  dry atmosphere         as   favourable         to
brilliancy,    but the observations are too few to settle the point.
    We shall now        suppose      that our first glow has sunk              down and
melted into the horizon colours.                 The sky now     has    little   red   in it
anywhere save in, the glowing                west.     The sky is now very much
 the same as        before     the first glow      began, only the        light from        all
 parts is now much less.               With the      assistance   of these         glowing
 colours in     the west, we shall         bow try to     explain the way in which
the second        glow is produced,             Shortly after the first glow dis
appeared,     it  was observed       that the overhead      changed      in  appearance,
the     blue slowly faded and became               a  whitish colour.         In, a short
 time the white        changed      to a reddish hue, and         at last       the whole
heavens     glowed with a fine red             light     Though     this second         glow
was     only now visible, it had been there for some time, but could
 not be     seen     by our unassisted eyes.            If, however, we used               the
 polariscope we could           see  it  at any time, after the      brilliancy of         the
 first glow had gone.            It  was not visible to, the unassisted eye, for
 the same reason that the first glow could not be seen overhead,                            on

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                         655
account of the blue light from the sky overhead mixing with the
red and making the sky look whitish.
   Now this second glow         I  hope to he able to prove is not caused,
like the first, by the direct rays of the sun shining on the particles
floating in the air, but by the particles engaged in the first glow being
now illuminated,      not directly by the sun's rays, but by the glowing
colours   on the western horizon.          The olouds, dust, and floating
matter to the west of us were so brilliantly illuminated,          that they in
turn   became a source of      illumination, reflecting their reddish light
in all directions, and illuminating particles suspended in the air in
every direction.      Puring last winter, when these sunset effects were
at their brightest,     I observed one evening, after the sun had set,
this red light streaming          in from the glowing west with such
brilliancy  as to   light up the smoke of         a factory chimney, making
it appear of a reddish colour       ; while all objects in the landscape of a
reddish hue shone out with * brilliancy out of all proportion to
what   we are accustomed to see.
    This glowing      light streaming in from the west falls            on the
partioles   suspended      in the atmosphere, and illuminates             them    ;
and the particles on which the sun shone directly and produced
the first glow, are again lit up with a reddish light, The effect
of this red illumination is not at first visible,          as the sun is     still
shining on the upper strata of the atmosphere, and the very fine
dust there reflects the blue light, which mixes with the red and
masks it       As the sun sinks lower, it shines on less and less of the
upper air, and    soon the    brilliancy of the blue is only equal to that
of the   red ;  the heavens then appear whitish, and when at last the
sun   passes altogether out of the dusty         air overhead, the red light
 becomes visible to the unassisted eye, and the heavens seem filled
 with  a reddish glow.
    It will  be   ohserved that the explanation          here offered  puts the
 position of the illuminated particles producing the sunset            effects at
 a much lower elevation than has generally been supposed.                 It will
 be necessary,    therefore, for me to give my reasons           for supposing
 that the phenomena       are really produoed by particles floating at com
 paratively low elevations. This explanation supposes that only
 the first glow is produced by the direct rays of the sun, and the
 second   glow by reflection, or rather radiation from the illuminated

656                      Proceedings        of the Royal Society
particles near- the horizion ;           it is therefore          necessary         for   me    to show
how this second glow is produced without the direct rays of the sno.
It   may be that while the second glow is visible, the                                    sunis still
shining in         the    atmosphere        overhead,          but at the               time of the
second glow          it touches only the tipper limits, and there are no
particles there large enough to reflect red light.                         Indeed, the second
glow is not visible          till the rays have           passed out       of the air in which
the particles are large enough                  to    reflect blue bight.                 It    is clear,
therefore, that the second glow                  cannot have its source in direct
illumination.
     There are different ways of satisfying                    ourselves that the second
glow is but a reflection of the sunset colours on the horizon, by the
same particles as shone            by direct sunlight in the first glow.                          Before
going     further,       there is a      most important                  fact      which        requires
attention.      It   is one to which we are so much accustomed that we
might not give       it its true value.         It    is,   however, so important,                in the
study of these phenomena, that                  it   is   necessary      we should constantly
keep,   it   in view.        Of   course,   every one knows that daylight                          is   far
brighter than gaslight, but how difficult                    it   is   to realise the difference.
On any ordinary day at sundown, light the gas                             ;   it   has no effect —
the room    not
              is bit better lighted.
                         a           Leave the                                gas   lit, and      as the
sun sinks,      note how the gas begins to light up                        a    wider and wider
area, and at last the room appears                    to be brilliantly             illuminate           by
the gas alone, while outside we can still                     see      our way about, and the
last of these sunset effects are still visible.                        Now, try to realise thu
enormous soale of brilliancy wa have got to deal with in daylight.
We should          be more sensible         of the difference were                  it    not   for   the
curtain in front of our eyes, which nature draws closer and closer the
more brilliant the light is.             As only enough light                 is   admitted to tie
retina to give distinct vision,                 and as the amount                  is   pegulated       by
unconscious movements, we are not so sensible as we might                                         be of
the vast scale of illumination used by nature.                           Keeping ever in           tkv
this    vast scale       of brilliancy we have to work with at sunset,                             it   is
easy    to see that what          is   dark at one time, and under certain coo-
ditions, may really appear brilliantly illuminated                          a short time after
under different conditions.                 A   cloud, for instance, on                 a   bright sky
may look black, but remove the bright sky and we find the cloud u
brilliantly lighted up.

      When the first glow                 was     formed, and during the time it was
descending           as   well   as when        it melted into the horizon colours, the
glowing west no doubt was radiating                     of red light in
                                                                a great amount
all    directions, but no red glow was visible overhead, on account of
the great amount of white and blue light also reflected by the sky,
by which          the red effect           was      masked ; as we have seen, however,
it   was there all the time, but only became                              visible when the other
light       ceased     to be reflected by the sky.                  Now, though during the
second glow the sky                   seemed to get          lit up with a red light, yet the
brilliancy of its total illumination had not increased, it had rather
decreased, as we can satisfy ourselves by observing that while all
these       changes        are   taking place the stars                are    becoming         more and
more numerous, showing that the daylight                                  has     been decreasing all
the time.
      It   has already been mentioned                    that immediately              after sundown,
a thin silvery film of cloud                   was always            seen over the          western sky
before the first glow                became      visible.       "What appeared           to be this    film
has also       been detected overhead                   with the polariscope while the sun
was shining               on   it,   and its faintly indicated                outlines      traced, as      it
shone as       a   red filmy cloud when the polarised                     light was cut       off.    Now,
as    it   was observed that the second glow took place                           in   these same     filmy
clouds, and that this second glow was not visible for some time after
the first glow, and not till the sunshine had almost left our atmo
sphere,      it   is   evident that the filmy clouds from which these glowing
colours proceed                are at no great elevation.                  Another thing which
indicates that the second glow                   is   but   a   reflection of the horizon colours,
is that      it   was always possible to tell whether the second glow would
be brilliant or not before                 it    made       its appearance.            If   the horizon
colours       were high up and brilliant, then there always followed                                        a
 brilliant second glow               ;   but   if   they were low and dark, no second
 glow followed.                There      was thus          a    direct      relation       between        the
 brilliancy of the sunset colour and the second glow.
      It   may here be asked,              Is the horizon glow sufficiently brilliant to
 light up the floating                motes    all over the sky, and account for tho
 brightness of the second glow                      1    This doubt          is   again suggested by
 something which, from its very familiarity, we have almost ceased
 to notice.            The amount of light that streams in from the western sky
 after sunset             is   much greater than                we    might imagine.             It   is   not
      vol* xn.                                                                               2 r

G58                  Proceedings    of   the   Royal Society
much noticed, because       it casts but     little shadow, on account of the
light coming from a wide area. To satisfy ourselves, however, of the
brilliancy of the western sky, compared with the north, south,
or east, we have only to project, by means                   of  a mirror,    a  small
area    of the western sky on to the             eastern.    Compared       with the
reflection of the western sky, the eastern looks black,               and the     pro
jected image contrasts as strongly with the eastern sky as the sun
does    with the heavens at mid-day.
    There is another way of studying the illuminating power of the
western sky, which        I   had occasional opportunities of following.
 On   some   evenings there were a few small               clouds floating      about,
just enough of them to show the successive illuminations, but not
so many as to cast shadows, and interfere               with   each   other.    These
test reflectors were carefully watched as the sun went down and                     till
it  was nearly dark.      As the sun touched the horizon, it shone into
my room, and painted an image of the window                        on the opposite
 wall in bright orange light.       At the      same moment       it lighted up    the
little clouds with the      same   coloured light.         This colour deepened
on the clouds as the sun sunk below the horizon,                  till they glowed
 with   a fine red light.   After   a little the sun had sunk            so  low that
 it ceased to shine    on the clouds, their brilliancy died away, and at
last they looked black.        The sky overhead, however, still remained
 brilliantly illuminated.      After   a time a change began to appear ; as
 the light in the sky died away the clouds lost their dark look,                   and
 gradually after a time appeared to be lighted up again                ;  till at last
 their   western    edges    again    glowed       icith  a   red light,     in gene
 ral  appearance    very much the same as the first red illumination.
 This time obviously the source of the illumination was the western
 sky, as tho clouds were much too low to catch the direct rays of
 the sun.     The boundaries of the illuminated parte were no longer
 sharp, as when the sun shone on tliem, but hazy and indefinite                     oa
 account of the light coming to them from the wide area of the
 western sky.
     So far as  I have been   able to judge, the second glow which illumin
 ated the whole heavens was produced              in exactly the      same     way   as
 the second illumination of the clouds as above described.                    On some
 evenings thin hazy clouds floating in the sky,                 a little below the
 haze that gave the true glow, were          brilliantly illuminated         with  red

                       of Edinburgh, Session 18S3-84.                               G59
light, and shone more brightly than the true glow                    ;  and on some
evenings, these thin clouds and the glow haze seemed to be so near
the same elevation, that it was difficult to distinguish                the one from
the other.
    It is scarcely necessary        to say that the clouds, like the second
glow, did not really get lit up with red light.                  The appearance       of
lighting up was not a reality, but was due to the other light dying
out of the sky more quickly than the red light in the west, and the
light now coming from the clouds being more brilliant than that
from the sky, the clouds appeared bright on the dark sky.                          Some
interesting     colour effects were observed on the second illumination
of the clouds.        They were not always coloured to the                 same   depth
of red at all points where they were exposed to the western glow.
The western edge of the cloud, for instance, was generally of a light
red ; whilst the parts which projected underneath, and were exposed
to the western glow, were of           a  much deeper red.         This was      caused
by the western edge of the cloud being exposed to the illumination
of the white and blue sky in the west and overhead                        ;  this light
with the red made the exposed                edge  whitish     red, while the parts
projecting underneath the clouds were protected from the white and
blue, and exposed only to the horizon glow                 ;  they shone      therefore
with   a redder    light.
    It has been said that the colour of the first glow was not the same
as   the sunset colours of the horizon, but was of                    a crimson     hue.
Now this is just what           we   might expect, because, from the lower
strata in which the large particles are, red or reddish light is reflected
to us, but this red light is accompanied by a certain amount                          of
blue light from the higher strata, and the combination                      of a small
amount     of blue with the red gives             a crimson     tone.      The second
glow, for the same reason, was of a similar colour.                    On the horizon
the red is combined with the green and yellow, causing it to appear
more or less orange.
    It  will   be   interesting   in the future,        when     all    these  peculiar
sunsets are over, to        see  if   we can    find any of this afterglow            by
means of a polariscope.            It   is obvious that thero may be              a con
 siderable    amount     of   red afterglow      in the west, without its ever
 being   visible to     us.    The    reason   for   this,   as already      explained,
 is, that    a mixture      of red and blue lights appear white,                 and   as

GOO                    Proceedings     of  the Royal Society
the red glow comes to us mixed with a certain amount of blue                    light
from the sky beyond, a certain amount of red light is masked, and
it is only when the red is greater than           a certain proportion       that it
becomes      visible   as red.     Any amount     less,  only changes the bine
towards      white.     If, however, on searching the sky overhead after
sunset with the polariscope, we find the red still there, we may
be sure it       will  be followed     by a red glow in the west, though              it
may not be visible to our eyes.
                                     Conclusions.
    We      may sum up          our  conclusions     under   the five     following
heads    : —
    1.  If  our atmosphere were perfectly pure, and free from suspended
particles, there would be no twilight.             When the sun sunk under
the horizon, its rays would pass through our atmosphere into space,
without revealing           themselves by illuminating        our sky,     and the
moment the sun disappeared total darkness would                    follow, almost
as   quickly    as when a candle is extinguished         at midnight.
    2.  The greater the amount of suspended particles           — up to    a  certain
quantity — there is in the atmosphere, and the greater the height                    to
which they       are diffused, the more the western sky       will be  illuminated
 at sunset, and the longer        will be the   twilight.
    3.  The    greater   the amount of suspended particles           of extremvk
small size      there is in the atmosphere, the more highly coloured               will
be the transmitted         light of the sun and the reflected light of the
sky.
    4.  The western         afterglow   is caused    by the    transmitted       light
being reflected       to the earth by small dust crystals floating             in  the
 air.
    5.  When there        are plenty     of suspended particles in the itE>
 sphere, the western sky at sunset becomes so brilliantly- luminou-.
 thut it radiatos light in every direction, and illuminates the suspended
 particles    all over the sky, causing them            to  shine long after       the
 direct rays of the sun have left them.

4.         Thermometer Screens.               By Mr John Aitken.                    (Plate VI.)
                                              Tart I.
   In meteorological observations the temperature of the air is of
the first importance, and it is a subject to which a great deal of
attention is given,               thousands    of temperature observations                being
made and recorded every day.                    It   is therefore desirable that these
observations shall be as correct as possible.                          At   first sight nothing
seems       more        simple than to take the temperature of the air.                     All
that appears            necessary is to hang up a correct thermometer of any
construction, anywhere out of the sun, and the thermometer                                 will
then indicate the temperature                  of the air where the instrument               is
placed.           "We shall presently see that this is very far from being the
case ;      and not only so, but we shall find that                     it is difficult to get
two thermometers                which will give the             same    readings, when hung
near each           other in the open air, even though they agree perfectly
with each other when placed in water.
      It    has    been    the custom of most observers to place the thermo
meters       in some kind of screen, to protect them from the sun and
the rain.           Many forms of        screens     have been devised, but Steven
son's is          the    one    that has met with the              most general approval.
This screen consists of a square-shaped box, the sides of which are
made        of double-louvre boards.            In this         box the thermometers are
protected from radiation,              while the air        can    circulate freely through
it.        No doubt Mr Stevenson's             screen      is   admirably adapted to our
climate, where            we scarcely ever have calm weather, and the tem
perature          of the air inside the    screen     is   generally nearly the same as
that of the          air outside it.     My attention            has,   however, been lately
directed      to certain conditions of climate under which this screen                       is
not suitable.             In    France and  Italy there  frequently
                                                                  is  succes         a
sion of perfectly              calm days, in which the sun shines with great
brilliancy         and strength.        Under      these    circumstances      I     have seen
the Stevenson screen baking in the sunshine, and the thermometers
recording temperatures much higher than that of the air outside
them.         These calm, sunny days are not unknown in this country,
though        they may occur seldom            ;     and    it    seems     worth   while con
sidering whether something ought not to be done to prevent the

6(i2                    Proceedings    of the Royal Society
too   high    readings given on exceptional days             in   the screens          at
present    in use.
   To get the true temperature of the air, the simplest plan                 seems to
be to place the thermometer in some             sort of box or tube where              it
will lie   protected      from radiation, and to cause       a  rapid current          of
the air to he tested to rush over it.             The only difficulty in           prac
tically carrying out this method for general           meteorological        purposes
is to get some simple means             of keeping up    a constant and rapid
current of air.        There are many ways in which this may                be    done,
but none of them are very satisfactory.               We might, for         instance,
by means of a pipe, connect the box containing                  the thermometer
with    a   chimney, under which a fire was constantly                 burning      ; or
we might keep up the draught by means                 of a jet of gas burning
in  a  vertical tube placed over the thermometer box               ;  or we      might
use a     revolving      fan   and water power, or a water             jet,    or    any
other easily applied method of             causing a current         of air     at the
place   where the observations are to be made.                  All    these     plans,
however, require special           apparatus and constant attention             to see
they are in working           order  ; and though some of them might                  be
used in certain conditions, yet none of them are suitable for general
adoption.       A simpler and self-acting arrangement                has    therefore
been   designed, by means           of which   a  current of air is kept            con
stantly    flowing    over    the   thermometer.     This apparatus           consists
of   a    screen    and a draught        tube  combined, the         draught       tube
being heated and put into action by the sun's rays.                      The    screen
acts during     ordinary     dull weather when the wind is blowing,                 and
the draught tube keeps            up the air current over the thermometer
when the wind falls.           This draught tube     is always    in action      when
required, and most when most required, always acting more                      power
fully  the stronger the sunshine.
   Plate    VI.  fig. 1  shows the theoretical form of    a thermometer         screen
made on this principle.          The thermometer t is placed in the lower           end
of the vertical tube ab.          The lower part a of the tube is constructed
of some non-conductor, or some other arrangement is made to                   prevent
radiant heat getting to the thermometer.             The upper part         6 of the
tube is made of metal, and painted black.             Suppose this tube         placed

become heated, and          will warm the air insida       A rapid      current will

thus be formed, and       will keep rushing up the tube while there is any
sunshine.      In this way a current of air will be kept flowing past the
thermometer      ;  and the thermometer being protected from radiation,
the correct temperature of the air           will   be obtained    during calm and
sunny weather.
    One of the principal difficulties metwith in the construction of this
screen is to prevent heat getting to the thermometer through                        the
lower part of the tube.        If  any heat get conducted through the walls
of this tube, it will heat the air inside, and the inside surface of
the tube     will also radiate heat to the thermometer, and the indicated
temperature will be too high.
    In figs. 2, 3, and 4 are shown some of the different forms of this
screen which have been made.              It will be observed that they differ
principally    as to the manner      in which the lower part of the tube is
protected.       In   the screen    represented in section in fig. 2, the
thermometer t is placed near the bottom of the long tube ab, which
is made of thin metal.         To prevent heat getting to the thermometer,
the lower part of the tube is surrounded by                    a second tube c, and
the   space between the tubes is        filled with       a non-conductor.       But  as
all non-conductors       are far from        perfect, still greater protection        is
necessary, and the lower part of the draught tube is surrounded                      by
two conical-shaped metal sunshades d,                e.    A  space is   left between
the two     shades for the free      circulation        of air to keep them        cool.
The    screen is supported on three         iron   legs at the standard       height of
 4 feet from the ground.
    In  fig. 3 another form of       construction is shown.            In  this instru
ment the lower end of the tube,           as   in  fig. 2, is surrounded     by  a tube
c, and non-conducting       covering, but in place of further protecting the
 lower end with      a shade,  it is put into     a circular box d, made of louvre
 boards similar to a Stevenson screen.           The air which     enters the draught
 tube of this    screen comes    from the lower side of the box.                As this
 air  has been    in contact with the surface of the under side of tho box,
 and may thus have got        heated,    there are placed inside the tube, and
  surrounding the thermometer bulb, two concentric                    tubes   / and    g,
  made of non-conducting         material, to prevent the heated air from
  touching the thermomoter.           By this arrangement the air which flows
  over   the thermometer has tho true temperature, as                    it  has  never
  touched the surface of any solid         ;  and as the only radiation to which

004                    Proceedings       of  the   Royal Society
the   thermometer is exposed,             is that from a small surface               of    the
ground under the open end of the tube,                 it  has   little  effect, and the
thermometer shows nearly the true temperature of the                            air.     The
screen   shown in fig.        2   is also   provided with non-conducting                 con
centric tubes    / and    g, surrounding        the thermometer bulb the same                as
in  fig.  3, as these      tubes prevent heat being               conducted       inwards
towards the thermometer.
   It  may be thought that in these               screens    the thermometer is too
well protected,      and that it        will follow     too   slowly the      changes       in
the temperature of the air.                The    changes     must no doubt           be to
a  certain degree sluggish.           This, however, does not seem practically
tn interfere   with the readings so far as has been observed.                           This
sluggishness will prevent sudden local gusts of hot air from                          affect
ing    the readings.        An addition        has,   however, been made to              one
of the screens to cause it to act more quickly while                         the wind        is
blowing.      It  is shown in section at h, at the bottom of the draught
tube in fig. 2.        It  is simply a wind deflector,             made    of  a  circular
piece of wood shaped as shown             in  the sketch, and having a number of
thin vertical radial plates fixed on it.                 When the wind blows                 it
enters the radial passages, and has its course                 deflected   upwards and
past the thermometer.            In this way       the wind keeps up a circulation
in the draught tube while there is no sunshine.                     Experiments         have
also been     made     to get some satisfactory form of wind-ventilating
apparatus,    which could be fixed near the top of the draught tube,
to   cause   a   rapid    upward        current     when     the ¦
                                                                    wind is blowing.
The advantage        of putting       the wind circulator         near   the top of       the
tube, is that when placed there             the    air does not come into contact
with any    surface before       it  reaches    the thermometer, and therefore,
theoretically     at   least,   the arrangement is more perfect than                      the
other.    The slight heating got by having                  it underneath the           tube
is found practically to be of little importance.
   To combine the full advantage                 of wind-circulation       with that        of
the draught tube the screen shown in fig.                  4 has been devised.             A«
before, ah is the draught           tube.      To the lower end of this tube                is
attached    a  small circular         louvre box c, and to protect this box
from the sun and rain an umbrella-shaped shade is placed over it.
This   shade consists     of two circular discs of wood d and             e, and   a metal
covering   /,   all   fixed parallel       to each     other, and with air spaces

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                               G65
between them for the free circulation               of air, to keep them cool and
to prevent the heat absorbed on the top during sunshine penetrating
to the thermometer.              When fitted up the discs          are placed      hori
zontally,      that the wind may blow freely between them from any
direction.       The thermometer is placed with its bulb in the louvre
box, and its readings taken through an opening g, in the draught
tube, this opening being closed with a glass plate or provided
¦with     a    door.    In   this   screen      the wind blows     freely over the
thermometer,           and when     the wind falls      and the sun shines the
current is kept up by means of the draught tube, so that under all
conditions nearly the true temperature is indicated.                    This   screen is
the last devised, and        seems to possess over the other two forms the
advantages of simplicity,           cheapness,    and convenience.
     These screens are suitable only for recording              maximum tempera
tures.        For minimum temperatures the arrangement is similar to that
shown in        figs. 3 or 4,   only inverted, the draught tube being placed
underneath        the thermometer.           A convenient arrangement is to           use
an L-shaped minimum thermometer, and fix the stem into the top
shade.  To enable the index to bo set this shade is hinged, so that
it   can be placed vertically        to cause the index to drop.
     Some of these instruments              have been tested and found to work
satisfactorily, but complete            tests    continued   for some    time in all
weathers will be made and are required before any practical decision
as to     their value can    be given.
                                Wet Bulb Observations.
     In   meteorology, the next most important point after the tempera
ture, is the humidity of the air.                Different methods are     in   use   for
determining this most important point, but the                  one most generally
used is the indirect one of simultaneous readings of wet and dry bulb
thermometers.           These observations are generally made in some kind
of   screen,    the wet and the dry bulbs being placed near each other.
Little consideration is         necessary    to show us that less favourable con
ditions for obtaining the true condition of the air could scarcely                     bo
selected, because        the amount to which the wet bulb is depressed
depends, not only on the dryness of the air, but also on the rate at
which the wind circulates through the                  screen   and over       the wet
surface.       The result of this     is,   that with the same dogreo of humidity

66^                     Proceedings of the Boyal Society
of the air we may have at the same temperature very different read
ings of the wet bulb, according to the rate at which the air may
happen at the time to circulate                   The quicker the circulation,             up
to a certain      rate,    the lower        will  be   the temperature          indicated.
Now it is evident that              if  the readings       are   correct when taken
in calm air, they must            be incorrect when there is a             rapid circula
tion ;   and as the rate           at which the air circulates             in   screens     if
constantly varying,         the observations made with the arrangements ai
present   in   use are of    little value.
   The   reason for the difference           in the readings taken under the dif
ferent conditions seems to be             that, when there is no circulation, the
atmosphere round the wet bulb is more moist than the surrounding
air, owing to the evaporation, and the wet bulb thus indicates                        a high
humidity     ;  but when the moist air is removed                  as   quickly    as   it  is
formed, the temperature falls lower.                 In illustration of      the effect of
the greater or less freeness of the circulation on the readings                  of the  wet
bulb, and to show the small value of the indication                     of some of        the
instruments at present in use,             I will give   the readings of a combina
tion of     wet     and dry        bulb thermometers which is now                    before
me.    The instrument            is one of a kind which is frequently used.
The two thermometers              are fixed to a piece       of boxwood, on which
the scales      are   marked         The bulbs of the thermometers                  project
some distance below the edge of the scale.                    The thermometer            and
scale are carried     in   a   metal frame which supports the water botth
for moistening        the wet bulb.           The observations were made in t
room, to get constant conditions of temperature and moisture.                            Tbe
instrument was hung clear of everything,                  to allow of a free circula
tion at the back.              Under    these    conditions    the    readings      of thf
thermometers were— dry bulb                  62°,   wet    bulb   a   little under       59".
The thermometers          were     now taken out of the frame, and hung                    up
in the same place        ;   the increased freedom of circulation                 obtained
by removing         the frame        made     the wet      bulb    fall to 57*.          Th*
instrument was now placed in a strong draught of air, produced br
a revolving      fan, when the wet bulb fell to 56°, the dry one                           re
maining     all the time at          62°.     Using this instrument            as was      in
tended by the maker,             it showed      a  humidity of about          80.    Wbei
stripped of its frame and the air allowed                  to get freely       at the wr:
surface,   it showed        a   humidity of       72, and when put          in   a current

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                            667
 of air it said the humidity was only              67.   From    these observations
 we see the necessity of keeping the wet bulb at a distance from all
 objects which       interfero with the free circulation           of the air.    But
 even with the very best form of construction,                 the readings taken
 at difFerent times, and by different instruments,                can   not be com
 pared with each other unless we can control the circulation.
     For the purpose of getting the true temperature of the air with
 the dry bulb, the Froude, or sling thermometer has been devised,
 but its evident inconvenience and risk have prevented its general
 use.    An improved form of this method of observing has been
 designed by Mr Edwin Clark.                In his observations he uses a whirl
 ing table, to which the instrument              is attached, the table with the
 thermometer being rotated rapidly before the readings are taken.
 Mr Clark    has also used his       whirling table for wet bulb observations.
 By    these means      a decided advance has been            made,    and a nearer
approach to correct readings of wet and dry bulb thermometers has
been obtained.          The practical difficulty in working this apparatus
 is the impossibility of taking the reading while the nir is acting on
 the instruments      ; and as the table requires to be stopped before the
readings can be taken, there is time for them to change.                  To obviate
this difficulty,    I   have arranged for wet and dry bulb observations
a simple revolving fan arrangement for keeping up a circulation of
air past the thermometers, which brings them quickly to the correct
temperature, and allows the readings to be made while the air is
rushing over the instruments.
    This apparatus is shown in figs. 5 and 6. Fig. 5 is a back eleva
tion, and fig. 6 a side elevation shown in section. The bulbs q£
the thermometers         t, t, are placed   in the horizontal tube a     ; a vertical
division being fixed in the tube between the bulbs.                   The tube a is
placed at a height           of   4 feet  from the     ground, and is supported
by the two standards            bb, which    are   firmly fixed in the ground, or
otherwise     supported.         For circulating the air      a large fan is used,
as   it enables    us to dispense        with all multiplying       gear,  which is
troublesome,      and     apt to get out of order when             exposed     to the
weather.      This fan is shown at           c ;  it is driven by the handle       d,
which has      a small radius to enable us to             turn it rapidly.*      The
   *
      The handle has been coupled by means of a connecting-rod g, with a short
lever or treadle /, if we may use the word, which is actuated by tho hand.       This

6G8                  Proceedings of     the  Royal Society
tube a and the fan     c are  connected by means of the pipe e.           Whes
the fan is revolved,       a rapid   current of air is drawn       in   through
the tube a, and over the thermometers, which quickly acquire                  the
correct temperatures.       When the fan is turned very slowly the           wel
bulb falls  a  little below the dry bulb, and falls further and further
as the velocity is increased    ; but this fall only goes on     till a certain
slow velocity is attained, after which any increase in the rate at which
the fan can be driven does not alter the temperature, either         of the wet
or of the dry bulb, but only causes them to acquire the correct tempera
tures more quickly.       With this apparatus we always get the            same
difference of temperature with the same conditions of atmosphere.              It
will  be noticed that the upper part of the fan is cased        in to prevent
the air currents put      in motion by it from rising and entering           the
suction pipe a, and coming into contact with the thermometers.
   When this fan arrangement is put into action, the air drawn into
the thermometers does not come into contact with much heated sur
face, and the circulation    is sufficiently rapid to keep the sides of the
air  passage at the temperature      of the air, and also quick enough to
absorb any heat the thermometers may receive by radiation j it
may therefore be assumed that the readings given by the dry bulb
show very nearly the true temperature of the air.            This apparatus
has accordingly been used in preference to the Froude thermometer
for testing the action of the different forms of thermometer screens,
their degree of perfection being judged by the nearness with whick
the readings of the thermometer placed in them agreed with those
given by this fan arrangement.          The readings were also occasionally
checked by means         of the sling arrangement;       which,   however, is
very difficult to use, especially when the sun is shining.

    Before concluding this paper,      I  wish to record the results of   sorci"
observations made       to test the effect of size on the temperature of
bodies placed in the open air, as these results have a direct bearing
on our present subject.
    Let  us first consider the temperature       of bodies under the       most
arrangement has been found much more convenient than the handle,           u  aa
impulse enn be easily given by means of it to the fan while it is in rapid
motion.

simple conditions for observation.            Suppose the sky overcast,         with
a uniform and thick covering of clouds, that a fresh breeze is blowing,
and that the temperature has been constant for some time. Under
these conditions, the surfaces of all bodies, large and small, in the
open air, have nearly the same temperature. But now suppose the
the clouds to clear away, and the sun to shine out brightly.                     The
temperature       equilibrium is    soon    destroyed, and the surfaces of the
different bodies quickly take up different temperatures, all becoming
more or less warmer than the air. The degree to which the different
bodies are heated will depend on — 1st, their exposure to the sun ;
2nd, their exposure to the wind           : 3rd, the absorbing power of their
surfaces     for heat   ;  4th, their    conducting    power ; and       5th,   their
capacity for heat          But, in addition to    these,  I find  that the size of
the body, or rather the extent of its surface,            has  a  most important
influence.      These remarks apply to bodies placed in shade as well
as to those exposed to sunshine.
    Before describing       the experiments which        show the effect of size
 on the temperature of bodies, it will be necessary for            me to describe
 the nature of the objects surrounding the spot where these ex
periments were made, as the results in experiments of this kind are
determined       very much by the surroundings,           every position giving
a different result according to the objects to which it is exposed.
The view from the position of          these experiments is bounded           on the
south and west by trees at a considerable distance, on the east by
 shrubs close at hand, and backed by a wall which extends south
wards, and closes in the view to the south-east.                One half of the
 north   is bounded by a wall at a distance of 6 feet, and the other
 half by    trees at a distance,    while tho ground is covered with           grass
 in nearly every direction.         This site was selected on account of its
 being sheltered from the wind, and otherwise suited for the experi
 ments.
    When studying          the action of the draught          tube    thermometer
 screen,   the experiments were begun by erecting, in the position
 above described, a horizontal sunshade made of wood, 3 feet long by
 2 feet broad.     This   shade was erected at a height of about 5 feet from
 the ground.       In    the sunshade was made         a round      opening, into
 which fitted    a tall metal    tube.     This tube projected      1   foot down
 wards into the shade         and  2 feet   upwards   into sunshine.        Experi

r,70                           Proceedings            of   the    Royal Society
incuts were now made                      by testing the readings of                             a    thermometer
when placed in different positions.                               The results with which we                               are
at present          concerned            were     got      when the thermometer                             bulb          was
pushed up inside the tube, and when it was pulled                                                   down        clear of
it.        When     the bulb         was        pulled down and clear of the                                    tube, it
always showed about a degree lower than when in the tube.                                                            Jfow,
why was this             1     The thermometer and the tube were both subjected
to     the    same conditions, and we                         might          have       expected        that          they
would         have       the      same     temperature,             that the thermometer would
read the same inside the                        tube as outside, or we might have                                         ex
pected        it   to   be     cooler     inside        the      tube,       as    it would            there have
the        advantage         of    the     upward          current       ;    yet it showed                 a    higher
temperature             inside      than        outside.            I    now stopped the upward
current in the tube to                   see    the    effect on the thermometer.                               When
ever         the    current        was         stopped,       the       temperature                 began       to    rise
till   the thermometer was more                            than     2°   higher than when placed
outside the tube.
      It   was thought that the high temperature                                   inside might be partly
due to         the heat           radiated from             the     hot upper part of the                            tube.
The apparatus                was therefore            taken within doors, to get a constant
temperature,            and the draught tube heated                           by means of a gas                  flame.
Xo     increase         of temperature           was, however, observed                        when the upper
part of the tube was heated.                          We may therefore                        conclude that but
little heat is radiated              downwards, or at least that all the heat that
is radiated         to the thermometer                is easily carried away by the upward
current of air.               Another possible                explanation               is,   the    difference           in
the absorbing powers of the surface of the tube and of the thermo
meter bulb.              As    the tube, however,                 was polished tin, their absorb
ing powers would not differ greatly.                                Neither of these explanations,
therefore,         seem satisfactory.              The other explanation which suggested
itself was that the difference in temperature                                  was due to the differenw
in size of the two bodies, the thermometer                                    bulb being about           J           of   au
inch in diameter,               while the tube was nearly                      3    inches.
      When we consider the conditions under which the thermometer
and        the tube were           placed, we can              easily        see    that the comparative
size of these objects would have                        a   most important influence in deter
mining their temperatures.                         When           the    sun       is   shining, all objects
exposed        to its rays get heated, and they in turn become sources                                                     of

radiation, and radiate heat to all surfaces in every direction within
their     view.          All    surfaces,     therefore, though shaded from the sun,
are receiving            a great amount            of radiant        heat ; and    if this heat was
not    carried away hy the air, the surfaces in shade would                                        acquire
nearly the          same temperature               as those     in sunshine.           But the supply
of    heat comes          in slowly from the sunlit                   surfaces,    and      the passing
air carries it away nearly as quickly as it is received. We see from
this that the temperature of bodies, even in the shade, is greatly
determined hy the                  rate at   which this radiant heat is carried away.
Now,      very little consideration is necessary to show us that the air
will     carry away the heat much                    more     quickly from         a small than from
a large     surface.            When     a current          of air    comes      into contact with            a
hot      surface, the air where                  it first touches the surface is rapidly
heated, and          a   film or layer of hot air is formed near that                              surface.
Now, if        the body is small, this hot layer is at once swept away, and
gives place to another cold layer, which in turn abstracts more heat ;
whereas in a large body, the hot film or layer formed where the
current first touches the body keeps near the surface in its passage
over     it,
        and forms, as    were,  hot protecting coat to all parts of
                                     it              a
the surface at           a   small distance              to the leeward of the point where
the current first touched it.                        No doubt this hot layer of air will
thicken        as   it    passes over        a   large surface, but the rate at which                    it
thickens       is   very slow after           it   has passed         over   a   very small distance.
This   I    have observed in my late experiments on dust.                                    The    effects
due to the heat in the air in front of                         a     hot flat vertical surface aro
almost all accomplished at the lower edge of the plate, where con
tact    first made, the upper part of the plate producing but
       is                                                      slight                            a
increase in the effect.  The result of the air acting in this way                                         is,
that   a    large body parts with its heat to the passing air at                                 a   much
slower      rate per       unit of       area than       a   small body does       ;   and as both are
receiving heat at the                same      rate, the temperature of                a   small body     is
lower than that of                   a   large one.           The protection           of large bodies
will     be far from being so perfect when the currents                                    are rapid and
the air     ceases to move             in    stream lines.
     Experiments             were made to             see    if   this reasoning            was correct,
 to determine whether                     large bodies were really hotter than small
 ones,      and     if       so,    to what          extent.         For     this purpose        I     pre
 pared      three         tin      boxes,      all    8      inches     long,      but      of   different

diameters,             being     J    inch,    2    inches,         and      4   inches respectively.
These boxes were provided with an opening in the centre of                                                  one
end, for the purpose                   of introducing           a    thermometer to             determine
their temperatures.                  Before being used they were painted black,                                to
get   a   good        and a uniform condition                   of all the absorbing               surfaces.
After      a     thermometer was                 fitted    into      each        box,    they      were        all
hung up under the horizontal shade, and perfectly protected                                               from
the direct rays of the sun.                        Alongside         of the boxes was                 hung     a
thermometer with                a    clean bulb, also       a   thermometer having the                    bulb
blackened with the same paint                       as used         for the boxes.            After       they
had hung for some time, no two of the boxes were found to                                                 have
the   same            temperature.         The      larger the box                   the higher       was its
temperature.              The difference           between          the temperatures,            as might
be expected,            was not always the same, because                             on no two        days     is
the amount of radiant heat the same, nor                                is   the rate of circulation
of the air the same.                  The following table shows the readings                           taken

tures at the particular                    place    on     the day the observations                       were
made.          Some       days the difference was less, but in spring                              weather,
when the sun               is   hot and the air cold, greater                        differences      may
                                                                                                               be
looked for.
  The boxes with their thermometers were then hung up under                                                  tho
horizontal sunshade in an open field, clear of all buildings,                                               and
surrounded by trees                  at some       distance.         The amount to which                     the
different boxes were heated was found to be almost the same                                               as   in
the more confined place, where the tests were first made                                      ;    showing
that the amount of heating                    is   not much influenced by the nature                           of
the surrounding             objects.

     Objection     might     be   taken to the manner in which                   the above
experiment       was made.         It  might be asked, for instance, Was not
part of the difference of temperature due to the heat received on the
side of the box next the sun being quickly conducted to the shade
side, in the small boxes, and carried away by the wind, while in the
large boxes the heat could only be slowly conveyed to the shade
side by the hot air in the box ? To check these results, I filled the
large box with        a   liquid, using turpentine, on account of its small
specific heat.       Placing this box in sunshine, and alongside of it the
half-inch box, in which           was    fixed a maximum            registering      thermo
meter, it was found that the large box attained a temperature of 96°,
while the thermometer in small                 one indicated a maximum                of  85°,
thus confirming the result of the previous experiment.
     "We might look on these boxes with attached thermometers
simply      as   thermometers         with very large bulbs.              We       see   from
 this that the indications of correct thermometers may vary when
 hung in certain positions, owing to a difference in the size of
 their bulbs.       No doubt       these are very extreme sizes,         still   I  find that
 the   size of the bulbs of the thermometers              in general      use does affect
 their indications.         Selecting two thermometers, one with                a large    and
 one with      a  small bulb,      I  hung them up beside each other under

 cated a temperature about half               a degree    lower than the large one.
  I may say that the precaution was taken of checking the readings of
 these thermometers in water at the same temperature as the air.                             It
  is possible that a difference in the thickness of the walls of the bulbs
  may have caused          the large thermometer to absorb more heat than
  the other, but this can scarcely account for the whole difference.
      Not only will the       size   of the bulbs     affect   the indications         in the
   open air, but the manner in which the thermometer is mounted                            will

with the air before it                          reaches       the thermometer, will cause i:
to read         too high.               The       system of sinking half of                             the baft
into a wooden frame cannot but interfere with the correctness of
the indications, save when the thermometer is perfectly protected
from radiation, and even then it makes the instrument                                                   sluggish.
All    thermometers not protected by proper screens,                                          such      as these
used     in     gardens,          and for         other rough              purposes, ought               to have
the bulb         perfectly            exposed to the air, and as far away from all
surfaces as possible.
     To illustrate the            effect    of    size and radiation,                 I may    mention          that
when     I    found that small bodies were cooler and nearer the tempera
ture of the air than large ones,                        I    repeated         my experiment with the
horizontal shade and vertical draught tube, but in place of enclosing
the thermometer bulb in a three-inch tube, a very small one wu
employed, just large enough to allow                                a   current of air to flow freely
between it and the bulb.                        The result, however, was                    that the upward
current did not quite compensate for the larger size of even this small
tube, and the thermometer was never quite so low in the tube                                                      s»
out of    it,   and exposed to the wind blowing at the time.                                        No        doubt,
in   a   calm day this arrangement would                                  have prevented any gnu:
rise in the temperature, and tho arrangement would have been better
than some screens or than no screen.
     These experiments,                  while      they          indicate      certain       errors      in     th*
construction          of thermometers, suggest                          some     possible advances and
improvements.                We have             seen       that the temperature                   of   a      body
exposed to radiation                  in the     open       air   is   colder the smaller          it   is.     The
meaning of which                 is   that the smaller            a    body    is,   the less effect radian:
heat has on          it,   and the nearer its temperature                                to that of the air.
Carrying out this line of thought, we                              see    that   if is   we could construct
thermometers               sufficiently         small in the bulb,                   they would          indicate
nearly the true temperature of the air, and                              if   small enough they would
indicate nearly the true temperature even in the sunshine.                                               A     ther
mometer mado                of   a    fine wire, for instance, would be well enough
protected       if   simply screened               from the direct rays of the sun.                              At
present  I      am attempting to get a mercury thermometer made with                                               a

 ture of the air when placed under             a sunshade such as that shown in
 fig. 4, hut without the louvre box.              I regret  that the time taken in
 getting    a satisfactory instrument          of this kind      made     prevents me
 from being able to say how near the indications of such an instru
 ment will approach the true temperature of the air.
    These experiments         have also suggested          the construction        of  a
cheap and simple radiation             thermometer, which has been made in
the following way :— An ordinary thermometer, or                    a registering one
by preference, is let into the surface of            a thick   piece of wood.       The
best size of this casing has not been determined, but it ought to be at
least   a foot square,    or, better    still, large enough to      encase the whole
stem of the thermometer.                The thermometer is let in to such a
depth that the bulb is level with the surface of the wood.                      Cement
is then put in to fill up all inequalities and restore perfect smooth
 ness to the board. The surface is afterwards blackened.                        It may
 be mentioned that, in order to make the instrument act quickly,                       a
 large    cavity    is cut in     the wood,        into which the bulb of the
 thermometer is placed, and the cavity is packed with cotton-wool,
 and covered over with            a  thin layer of the        cement.      There have
 only    been    two   opportunities      for making       observations with        this
 instrument.          On  one    afternoon it was placed in sunshine, and
 alongside      was hung     a  thermometer         with   a  blackened      bulb,   but
 exposed     to the air.     The blackened bulb only rose to a tempera
 ture of    78°,   while the    one fitted      into surface of the wood         rose to
 105°.
    This   effect of the size of the surface of a body            in determining the
amount of the cooling          effect   of the air will,    I hope,    help to explain
 some difficulties.       And    one     cannot help asking         here, whether we
have not in this       a suggestion as to the explanation of why it is that
dust in the sun's rays, focussed by               a powerful     lens, escapes being
burned.       It  does seem strange to any one accustomed              to use a
                                                                                " burn
              "
ing glass        to light cigarette or pipe, that the organic dust passes
through      the focus of his         lens without being          affected;    but the
moment the focus falls on the solid tobacco, it at once responds
with a cloud of smoke. Now why is this ? Does not the difficulty
of beating small bodies by radiant heat suggest the answer 1 It
is true the conditions are not alike. The small bodies we have
been experimenting          with    are   comparatively large        ;  and further,   a

   076                   Proceedings        of   the  Royal Society
  necessary condition is that they are fixed, and that the air moves
  over them,       whereas      the     dust particles move        with the air.          But
  may not a precisely similar                cooling effect be brought           about       in
  another way?           In   the case of a very            small object, like a        dust
  particle, a molecule of air, which                 has touched     it and   got  heated,
  passes into the widening space outside, and scarcely never returns                        to
  the    dust particle    ; so that        every air      molecule that      touches      the
 particle is cold, and the heat received by the particle is not                         con
 served     by the heated        molecules keeping near it and protecting                    it
 from contact         with   the    cold ones.          In this way the         molecular
 movements        accomplish for the dust what the mass movements                          do
 for fixed bodies.
     These experiments also              suggest      some   thoughts     regarding      the
 thermal      experiences      of different forms of life.             The tiny     insect.
 :is  it  sports   in  the sunshine, is the one above all others which                      i>
 generally supposed to have the greatest enjoyment in the warmth                            of
 the sun's rays.        From what we have seen, we now however know,
 that it is the one above all others which has the least reason                           for
 gratitude,    as  it can scarcely receive any heat from the sun.                 Let    the
 sun shine as brightly as          it  may,   it  can scarcely warm to a perceptible
 degree the tiny limbs of these fluttering insects               ; and   if it will  enjoy
 the sun's heat,      it must     descend to earth.          And what     a change does
it   meet with      there when        it lights    on branch or stem of tree          !    In
 a   moment it passes into an atmosphere                    twenty or thirty      degrees
 warmer than the sunlit air in which                     it delights.     On the      other
 hand, this immunity from the heating effect of the sun makes life
 possible    to   these   insects      under a sunshine that drives the larger
 animals to seek the shade.
                                           Part II.
                               (Added 23rd August 1884.)
     Since the first part of this paper was written, there has been                   some
weather suitable for testing the efficiency of the thermometer                    screens
under trying conditions.               From the beginning of the month till              the
22nd there were a number of warm, bright, and nearly calm                             days.
Under these conditions            it is well known that it          is difficult   to get
the true temperature          of the air; advantage           was therefore taken           of

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                           677
these exceptional conditions for making                        a   number of test observa
tions with the screens.
  For a standard of comparison, the fan apparatus already described
was used. The first thing to be done was to test the action and
efficiency of the draught produced by this fan.                             In   this apparatus
the vacuum produced is          less than         \     of an inch of water, and the
current consequently is not very strong.                       I
                                             therefore first compared
its action with that of a more powerful instrument, the fan of which
is driven by multiplying         gear, and         which easily gives              a vacuum of
1    inch of water, and draws         a perfect hurricane               of air over the ther
mometer.           Working   these two instruments                 alongside of each other
in   the open air on a bright day, there was not found to be any
difference in the readings of their respective thermometers                             ;   showing
that for all practical purposes the draught in the simple apparatus
gave as correct results as the powerful                       draught of the more com
plicated        fan.   The only advantage of the powerful                        apparatus was,
that it brought the thermometer            more          quickly than the other to the
temperature of the air.
     The readings of the fan apparatus                  were now compared with those
given by the sling thermometer.                    The        result was, that whenever
there was any sunshine, the fan thermometer read lower by one
degree than the sling, and        if    the sun was bright the difference was
more       than one degree.       I    shall     presently show              why     these        two
methods of testing the temperature of the air should give different
results, and why the sling should read higher than the fan arrange
ment      ; also   why the lower temperature given by the fan is nearer
the true temperature of the air than that given by the other.
     In   the   following experiments with the screens the fan apparatus
                                               it is,
has been        used as a standard, as it   think, more correct than the
                                                  I
sling     method, and also because                      is   much more           easily worked.
Assuming then the fan apparatus as our standard instrument,                                  it   was
fitted up alongside of the screens              on      a    lawn, in   a   position well pro
tected from any         little wind that might               be blowing,      so as to get the
most trying conditions possible for the screens acting correctly.                                 The
amount of wind during most of the experiments was very small, and
 generally from the east.         At times there was scarcely                       a   breath of
air, and during the calm periods frequent readings were taken.                                     In
conducting         the experiments, the fan was kept in constant action,

678                        Proceedings        of   the   Royal Society
and whenever the temperature was at all steady, readings were takes
of the thermometers in the different                     screens.
     The result of      these tests has been satisfactory.                    The thermometer
in none of the          screens rose much above the standard, even                           duriise
the most trying conditions of the experiments.                                The thermometer
in   screen fig. 3, under many conditions                      read almost the same as the
standard;       but     on one or two         trying      occasions,       when the wind dial
away and the sun shone brightly,                     the error was quite decided, and
amounted to an average of a little over half a degree.                                  From      my
notes on these occasions,             I   see   that it read sometimes exactly the
same as the standard, but at other tiroes                      it   was one degree too high:
generally, however, the difference was not so great, and gave ac
average    of   0°-6.      It    may be objected that we cannot average errors
of this kind,        because the maximum error may be the true                            error of
the instrument, as the maximum temperature to be registered might
happen just when                the error was greatest                   From the manner in
which the experiments                were       made,     it    is,      however, I    think      the
average,    and not the maximum that                     is   the true error of the screen.
The occasions on which the error                              was     greatest      was when      the
temperature was changing.                 The readings were taken while the tem
perature was falling         ;   and as the fan thermometer follows the changer
more quickly than the screen,                 it   had fallen more than half             a   degree
before almost any change was effected in the screen                                 thermometer    ;
so that when the readings were                     taken the screen           thermometer       wa»
still recording the higher temperature to which   was preTioosly             it
exposed     These tests do not show that the imiimnm of •creec
was ever one degree higher than the maximum of the standard.                                      A
more correct method              of testing would have              been to employ maximum
registering thermometers, and to take the maximum                                     temperature
indicated during         a   certain time.         This method was intended to                 have
been followed, and special registering thermometers were being pre
pared, but they were not ready in time for the experiments, which
had to be made before the hot weather was over for the season.
     The   screen     shown in fig.       4   has almost exactly the same                 error    «
screen fig.     3.    Though       its indications are nearly as true as those of
the other, yet        it   does not seem so susceptible of improvement.                           It
may be possible to reduce                 its error by changing the form of the
screen at the bottom of the draught tube.                           It   can, however, scarcely

boards    of the    screen become heated by radiation, and the                             air passing
over them gets warmed before arriving at the thermometer.
     In the construction of         screens   it is     necessary      to shade the thermo
meter as much as possible from all radiation.                           It   ought not to            see
anything out of its          screen.       A small amount of exposure                         even   to
the grass underneath             shows its effect in an increase of temperature.
This could bo observed wheu testing the                    screen fig. 4.             If   the bottom
was taken       out of the box, to allow of a freer circulation, the tem
perature always rose         a   little.    On the other hand,               if   the louvre box
was     made too close by the addition                    to it of complicated louvre
boards,    the flow of the air was retarded, more heated surface was
given to warm the air before it arrived at the thermometer, and in
this case also the thermometer read too high.                                The arrangement
shown     in the sketch is the         one which as yet has been found to give
the best results.       The thermometer is so protected that no radiation
from objects outside can           fall directly on          it,   while the free circulation
of the air is but little checked Perhaps an improved form of box
for this screen might be made of double louvre boards, but as this
would increase the outside diameter of the box, and consequently
the amount of surface over which the air has to pass                              ;   it   would also
greatly reduce the velocity of the                 air when no wind                   was blowing,
and     only   the draught         tube    acting   ;   it   is    therefore very doubtful
whether any advantage would be obtained.
      From the experiments on the temperature of large and small bodies
already    detailed,    we       have seen        that    large bodies become                    more
highly heated than small ones, when exposed either to the direct rays
 of                                                                From this
      the sun, or    only to diffused radiation.                                      we get some
guidance       for the construction of thermometer                       screens.           As large
bodies are less cooled by              air passing        over      them than small ones,
it    follows that the louvre boards in the thermometer box ought to
 be as large as     possible, because the air in passing over large louvres
 will   carry less heat   into the box than             if    it    passed    over small ones.
 The large size of the louvres             will   also prevent heat being conducted
 *o the   inside of the box.                           we wish to lessen              the radiation
                                       Again,     if
 from any particular         area, we must              reduce       all objects exposed in
 that direction to as small dimensions as possible, and coat them                                with
 Wme substance       which    is  a   good absorber of radiant heat.                       Blackened

     Attempts            have      ten      made to improve the            working of the             soxe
(fig. 3; by catting off all radiation from the ground.                                First, a small
non-conducting                 screen       was    filed horizontally       under the tube, bet
leaving plenty of space for the air to enter fredy ; but no decided
advantage was obtained.                        Then a small screen was placed in                          the
tube, joist under the thermometer bulb, to check the radiant heat
falling on            it,    but no reduction               in temperature was effected.                  Xo
great advantage can be got from placing a small screen under                                              the
bulb.          If   the effect of the upward radiation from the ground is to
be entirely checked,                   it   must be cut off from the inside surface                           >4
the tube, as well as from the bulb                          ;   as
                                                                 I    find that, to get rid           of the
last fraction            of   a    degree above the temperature of the air,                         it   is   of
far more importance to check radiation, than to increase the current
past the bulb            ;    as   a   very small amount of radiation                 is    equal to           a
strong current of air, and the changes of temperature in a                                          therm-
meter are far more                 quickly accomplished by radiation than by con
tact     with the air.                 These considerations             show us that           the tube
surrounding the bulb, in addition to being                            a   non-conductor, ought                fc>
bo made of some substance that has small capacity for heat, so that
its temperature may change quickly with that of the air                                       ;     becaui*-
the changes in the thermometer are caused                                 more    by the exchange
of heat with the surface of the tube than by contact with the air
passing over             it In         these      instruments        the inner concentric             tubes
are     made        of blotting             paper kept       in shape      by thin metal tubas.
Hair felt,          if it     could be got of suitable shape, might be better than
paper.
     The      screen        constructed           according      to the plan shown in fig.                 2
does not give quite such                       good results as the one made as shown
in     fig.    3.      In the former               screen     the draught tube           is    of    a   less
diameter, and the                  lower part        is     leas protected by non-conducting
coats         and air passages               than the latter.           This     suggests      that      th*
fraction of         a    degree too high,            given by the thermometer in screen
fig.    3,     is   partly         caused      by    heat conducted            through        the     lower
end of the tube, and radiated across the air passages.                                        This sup
position        has      been confirmed             by an examination of the air passages
by means of              a    thermometer.           The temperature of passage next                     th<

centre tube was found to be generally about                                         half a degree higher
than in             the centre            tube,     while the outer passage was often morn
than        a degree          higher, showing that the lower end of the tube is not
properly protected.                       Another screen is therefore being prepared, with
a    more          perfect screen protection,                 a larger        draught tube, and more
concentric               non-conducting              tubes and air passages, and               it     is hoped
this        new screen             will    have a less error.             It will   be remembered             that
the fan          thermometer               is,   under the conditions during the experiments,
always about one degree below the sling thermometer,                                        so that screen
fig.    3    is    nearly half         a   degree nearer the truth than the sling.
       It   is     only within the last few days that                     I     have been    in     possession
of      a Stevenson                screen, and been               able    to make comparative                trials
with         it.         During        these       tests     its action was compared                  with     the
fan         apparatus,            and readings were taken                    at the     same time       of the
thermometers in the draught tube screens.                                       These latter, as already-
stated, had an average error of about 0o,6 too high.                                         The smallest
error        recorded             in more than thirty readings                  of the thermometer                in
the Stevenson                     screen         was 10,3,    and    it    only fell to that           on     two
occasions.               The excess error was generally more than                              T,      and was
as high             as   2   '8   on two occasions.            The morning on which the trials
were made was certainly                             a   trying one, but was not so bad                       as   it
might            have        been,        for the Stevenson screen.                     The sun was very
strong, and there was but little air moving                                     ;   the   direction of the
wind,         however,            was favourable, being from the north-east,                            so    that
the air entering                   the screen passed over                 the cold louvre boards and
not         over     the sun-heated                 ones.     If    the wind        had been southerly,
the error would have been greater,                                  as the     entering air would have
been heated in its passage over the                                 hot      louvres.     These tests were
made on an exceptional day.                             On most days, when there                 is   wind, the
screen gives              a   much nearer approach                  to the truth than       it    did on that
occasion.                By   a    slight addition to this screen,               I      was able, when the
error was high, greatly to reduce it.                                 On those days on which the
wind blew from                    a   northerly direction, and the air entering the screen
came         in from          the cool side of the box,             I     found the high temperature
 given by the thermometer was due to radiant heat entering the open
 bottom of the box.                          Either     a solid or       a   louvred bottom has been
 found greatly to improve the correctness of this screen, but whether
 the solid or the louvred bottom                             is    the best has not yet been deter

                                   Radiation             Thermometers.
     Some        observations              have        been    made      with the radiation                ther
mometer          already described.                In addition          to this instrument,           another
has been          prepared.            In this          second       instrument        a small        circular
chamber          is made      in the         centre       of the black surface,               and covered
with thin          glass let       in level with that                  surface.       The thermometer
with its bulb blackened is                        exposed       in   the middle of this chamber.
This instrument always                       reads       higher than the other one in which
the bulb forms part of the surface.                               For this         reason,   it is    perhaps
not so satisfactory               as  the other, as it possesses something of the
so-called        " bottling       up

                                        powers of the black bulb in vacuo. These
radiation thermometers were generally exposed                                        in sunshine        while
the trials with the screens were going on.                                         Their indications,         of
course,         varied from hour                  to    hour     and from            day to    day.        The
highest temperatures                   observed          were     on the afternoon of                 the 7th
August, when the thermometer fixed in the black surface                                               rose    to
a temperature          of 144°, and tho one in small chamber                                 in the     black
surface         indicated a       temperature of               154°.      On the 8th, and on               some
other       days,     the temperature                    was     nearly       as    high.      When          the
observations were                 made,       the instruments                 were     generally       placed
near the         ground with the black surface                          perpendicular to the            sun's
rays, and freely exposed                    to any       wind that might              be blowing.            On
dull      and     sunless     days         these thermometers often read                       10°    or     15°
higher than the temperature of the air.
                            Thermometers                with Protected Bulbs.
     A short time ago,                 I   received       one of the thermometers specially
constructed for the experiments with small bulbs, to which                                              refer
ence       has    been      made           in the former               part   of this        paper.        The
directions         for the construction of this thermometer were to                                     make
the bulb as long as might                     be necessary             to give the desired capacity,
but its diameter             as    small      as possible.             The bulb of the instrument
sent      is,   however, not by any means so small as desired, nor so                                   small
as   it   might easily have                been        made.      Owing, however, to an unex

pected       change in the manner of working, this defect has not been of
importance, and the instrument                    has been       found to be very service
able.  The bulb is very long, being 55 mm. or more than 2 inches,
and has a diameter at the top of 3 mm. and of 2 mm. at the bottom.
It    is graduated from 0° to 100° Fabr., and has an expansion at the
top of the tube to prevent bursting when heated over 100°.                                       The
large capacity of the            bulb    has given a long and easily read scale,
there being almost 2 mm. between each degree.
      It   may be remembered            that this thermometer was constructed for

                                                       of investigation           suggested       by
the        experiments      on the temperature of large and                       small        bodies
exposed       to radiation.        It    had been found that the smaller a body
was, the nearer its temperature was to that of the                              air surrounding
it,    because   it   was more        quickly deprived,           by the passing air, of
the heat received by radiation from surrounding                           objects    ;    and there
seemed        reason for supposing that           if   the bulb of        a    thermometer was
sniau enough radiation would not heat                      it    to   a   perceptible degree.
This thermometer was therefore constructed with the intention of
seeing       how nearly      a   thermometer with            a   very small bulb               would
indicate the true temperature of the air.
   Owing to an unexpected change in the development of this
investigation, but few trials were made with this instrument as
received       from the maker.            A   few tests were, however, made.                      In
these experiments           the thermometer was placed under                         a   horizontal
sunshade, which protected                it   from all sunshine, and from nearly
the whole of the sky radiation.   The day on which the experiments
were       made was bright and warm, with  slight air from the east.
                                                             a
The radiation thermometer already referred to showed                             a   temperature
of 140° in the sun.              Under     these conditions,          the new thermometer
always read just about            a     degree higher      than the fan thermometer,
and was generally more than                    half    a   degree      lower than          another
thermometer with ordinary                 sized    bulb placed alongside of it.                    It
is,    therefore,     evident     tliat this instrument,               though        better than
an ordinary         one,    cannot be relied           on to give the true tempera
ture of the air when shaded                in the manner described               ;   as   it   would
read correctly        only on dull days, and            be   a   degree        more or less      too
high according to the brightness                   of the day.            If   the bulb of this
thermometer         had been made smaller, as ordered,                     it   is   possible the

684                      Proceedings         of    the   Royal Society
error might have been less.                   Dr Lenz*          has recently described         an
application of the telephone to the measurement of temperatures                                at
a distance.       Dr Lenz connects the observer with the distant station
by means of a thermo-electric combination of wires, into the circuit
of which he introduces                  a silent    interrupter        and a telephone.        If
the temperature of the junction at the distant station is not the
same as that of the         junction near the observer,                 a sound is heard       in
the telephones, which ceases when the observer has made                               the tem
perature of his junction the same as that of the distant one.                             This
arrangement suggests            of getting the true temperature of
                               a method
the air, by making the thermo-electric junction or junctions of as
fine wire       as possible,       and exposing them freely to the air under
shade at the distant station.                In this      way we might get as small             »
sensitive surface as        it is possible to construct
  On reconsidering the whole matter at this point, it soon                             became
evident that it is hopeless to expect any thermometer of ordinary
construction, however small the bulb, to give the true teniperatuir
of the air while it is exposed to radiation.    When we consider
what is taking place it is easy to see why this must be so. When
radiant       heat falls on the bulb of a thermometer,                          the heat       i»
absorbed not only at the surface of the bulb, but all through                              the
thickness       of the    glass,    and at the surface of the mercury.                    The
inside of the bulb therefore gets                    heated, and this heat must                be
conducted        outwards through            the glass before it can             be    carried
away by the air.            The consequence               is,   the inside of the     bulb     is
hotter    than the outside, and the thermometer                          while exposed to
radiation must always read too high, however strong the current of
air may       be to   which   it   is   exposed.         As the absorbed       heat require*
to be conducted to the outside, the inside of the thermometer must
always be considerably hotter than the air, so long as the radiation
temperature       is   higher than the temperature of the air.
  The natural          sequence to these thoughts was— cover the                    bulb with
something through which                 radiant heat cannot penetrate           ;   and   as   it
would be necessary          to use some substance having                 a   small absorbing
power for radiant heat, silver naturally suggested                        itself as the most
suitable material for the purpose.             I     accordingly coated the bulb and
part     of    the stem       of the fine-bulbed                thermometer     with silver

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                       685
deposited on          it,   from    a   solution of the nitrate.            By this simple
process  I    had now acquired              an extremely interesting              and curious
instrument.          Its powers of repelling radiant                heat,   if   wo    may use
the expression, are very remarkable.
     My first experiments with this instrument                       were     made         in the
beginning of this month.                I   first wished to get the heating effect
of the sun's rays on this silvered thermometer in calm air                                  ;    the
experiments         were therefore made in              a   room, and only enough of
the window          opened to      allow the sun to shine in on the thermometer,
which was placed with its bulb in sunshine.                                 Alongside             the
silvered     thermometer            was   hung     an   ordinary       thermometer,              and
readings were taken from time to time of the temperature of the
room     and of the sun-warmed thermometers.                         In     these     tests      the
silvered     thermometer never rose more than one                      degree         above the
temperature of the room, and was often only half                             a    degree,        and
sometimes less, while the other thermometer                          rose   from       4    to     4£
degrees above the temperature of the room.                        In   these experiments
it   was found       extremely difficult to get the true temperature of the
room with an ordinary thermometer, so much depended on where
the thermometer was placed, and the amount of radiation                                          that
reached   but the result given
             it,                 as correct as have been able to
                                              is                  I
make it. Another difficulty in making these experiments      the                            is
extreme sensitiveness of the fine-bulbed thermometer,         so                       it   is
constantly         rising and falling nearly        a   degree    in little more than              a
minute.       To give an idea of the difficulty of getting the tempera
ture of the room where the experiments were made,                         I      may mention
the following,         as   it   at the same time shows how much the indica
tions of ordinary thermometers                are affected       by radiation.          At       one
stage    in the experiments the thermometer employed for giving the
temperature of the room was hung alongside the other thermometers,
but provided with shade which protected
                              a                                it   from all direct sun
shine. "When in this position was in the    it                 same air as the silvered
thermometer, yet             it   always read higher, sometimes by nearly one
degree   ;   that    is,    the ordinary thermometer was more heated by the
radiant heat from the              carpet, and other objects      in the room on which
the sun was shining, than the silvered bulb was by the direct rays
of the sun added to the radiation from surrounding objects.
     The next       tests    with this instrument       were made outside under the

  6SG                   Proceedings      of the Boyal Society
 ordinary     conditions     for testing the temperature of the air. The
 thermometer was placed under a sunshade, similar to that shown
 in  fig. 4, but   without louvre box       at bottom, or draught          tube at       top.
 The    stem   of the thermometer          passed     through      the sunshade, the
 silvered bulb was freely exposed under the shade, while the seal-
 projected through        the top of the shade for convenience               in reading.
 The bulb was thus protected only from the direct rays of the sun,
 and from the greater part of the sky radiation.                   The fan      apparatus
 was used as a standard as in the test with the screens.                      It  must be
 confessed that the result surprised me not            a little.    That the     reading*
 of the silvered thermometer would             be nearly as low as those of the
 fan    thermometer,       I   quite   expected ; but         that    they    should       be
 almost always lower, was somewhat astonishing.                       There can be         no
 doubt but that      it  does read lower, but how much              it is very    difficult
 to say.     I have made many and continuous observations with it in
 different conditions of weather, but it always read lower than                          the
 thermometer in fan draught, when the silver coating was at all in
 good order, the weather bright, and the slightest air of wind moving.
 I  have watched the two thermometers for hours under trying                           con
 ditions from calmness and brilliancy of sun, and yet the result                        was
 always the same.          The difficulty of saying how               much     lower    the
 exposed silvered thermometer was than the fan thermometer,                          arises
 from the extreme sensitiveness of the fine-bulbed silvered                      thermo
 meter to rapid changes of temperature.                 Sometimes       it rises   higher
 than the other by a fraction of a degree, but only for a very short
 time, and at other times it falls much lower, the changes taking
place quickly.        The thermometer in the fan, on the other hind,
 follows    these   changes     more    slowly,    and never goes to the sans
extremes.       The quickness of this instrument                is most interesting,
and reveals to us a most curious fluctuating state of the temperature
of our atmosphere.           The mercury in it is in        a  constant state of       ebb
and flow.       That   these ups and downs really indicate changes                 in   the
temperature       of the air, or rather         differences      in temperature           in
different parts of the passing air, and are not due either to changes
in radiation or to variations in the cooling                effect  of the wind,       is   I
think indicated by the fact, that it was always possible, by watching
the silvered thermometer, to tell whether the thermometer in the
fan    draught    was going to       rise or to      fall,   as   all its indications

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                         687
were predicted by the silvered thermometer.                                    The changes in the
fan thermometer              are slow         compared with the other, owing to the
shape of the bulb, and to time being required to alter the temperature
of the air            passages,   which       radiate        heat to the thermometer.               So
nearly      as    I   was able to judge            from observations             made when         the
temperature was nearly steady, the average                              reading of the silvered
bulb       was about a quarter              of   a degree      below the fan readings.              It
might sometimes be                less when the          air was calm.
     The silvered          thermometer scarcely rose                    one     degree    above the
standard          when hung         in sunshine during                 a fine calm day, while
the radiation thermometer similarly exposed showed a temperature
of   131°, or 65° above the temperature                       of the    air.
     As    a great deal of radiant heat is absorbed by the glass                               of the
bulb of an ordinary thermometer, not only at the surface, but all
through          the body of the glass,            it   seems     probable that part of the
lower temperature indicated by the small bulbed thermometers is
probably due to this cause ; the small bulbs having a less thick
ness of glass than the large ones,                           as bulbs     with thin walls will
absorb less radiant heat than those with thick ones, and                                    will also
conduct the absorbed heat more quickly outwards to be carried away
by the air.
     I    have frequently          referred to the constant fluctuations                       in the
temperature of our atmosphere.                          Now, to prevent any mistake in
this matter, it will              be as       well for       me   to state more clearly            the
amount of these fluctuations.                      With       a thermometer having a large
bulb,      these      changes     are   little noticed; but after one                    becomes   ac
customed to the careful reading of thermometers with medium-sized
bulbs, they become very evident.                        In    the fan apparatus the changes
on certain days would               amount to half a degree more or less almost
every      minute,        and in        the      fine-bulbed          thermometer         they often
amounted          to a degree or more              in the      same     time.      These changes
take place whether the wind circulation is strong or slight.
     It   may be as well for us to consider here why the thermometer
in the fan draught should read higher than the silvered thermo
meter.       No doubt the silvered bulb will                      be a   little higher than the
temperature            of the air, but why should                     the fan      give    a   higher
reading still         ?   So far as     I   understand          it,   part of this higher read
ing given by the fan apparatus                      is   due to heat conducted inwards

C88                          Proceedings           of the Ruyal Society
through the indraught tube, and radiated to the thermometer;                                             and
part is due to the air which enters the tube having first touched                                         the
outside of the apparatus,                    and in this way got heated before arriving
at the         thermometer       ;    while the silvered thermometer is less                       heated
by diffused              radiation when            exposed          freely to the       air than          the
thermometer in the fan apparatus.
     All       these experiments have               been       made     with the        silver    coating
deposited on the bulb by chemical moans.                                 A comparison of              many
different experiments with different thermometers                                shows a variation
in    the protecting             power of the different coverings                       due to their
greater or less thickness, and also to their greater or less perfection,
and frecness              from    scratches        which       remove      the silver          from      the
glass.          In   some of the experiments the thermometers had two and
three coatings of silver                put on them, by placing them in                       successive
baths      ;    the surfaces of the bulbs being simply washed when                                    taken
out of one bath and placed                     immediately in the next.                  When         taken
from the final bath, some of the bulbs looked dull and dusty,                                            but
acted          quite well,       while others were improved                     by polishing            with
rouge.
     These chemically deposited silver coverings being rather                                    delicate
for practical purposes,                the    next thing to          be done    was to get a silver
sheath prepared             for the thermometer bulb.                    This sheath          was made
of thin          sheet     silver and fitted easily over the                     bulb, and it           also
covered part of the stum.                      The silver coating being dissolved                        off
the thermometer bulb, the silver sheath was polished, and fitted                                         on,
and the thermometer tested                     as before       with the fan apparatus.                  The
result in this           case was      not so good        as   with the chemically             deposited
silver.         The       readings      of the       thermometer now               almost        exactly
corresponded with                    those    of    the    fan thermometer          ;    that     is,   the
silver sheath reduced                  the     readings        1°    lower than the clean          gl&s-s
but gave about               0   "25    higher      than       the     deposited silver.           These
higher readings suggested                     that this sheath           was    not made         of   pure
silver.         On inquiry,      I     found this to be the case           ;    so another        sheath
was prepared,             and special precautions taken to have                         the     silver   as
pure     as possible.
     This       second     sheath was tried           on the morning of the 18th,                  when
there      was       a   bright sun      and almost no wind.                   As in    the    previous
experiments, the thermometer was simply plac                               e!   under    a    horizontal

  sunshade.      The     sheath was         found      to act almost as well          as the
 chemically     deposited silver, but not quite, its readings being gene
 rally about 0°"2 below the fan thermometer.                    As silver  has a tendency
 to tarnish, it    was thought        as   well to try the efficiency of gold as              a
 protector.      Gold is not quite so well suited for the purpose,                      as   it
 absorbs more        radiant    heat than silver          ;  while silver     only absorbs
 3 per cent., gold absorbs          5   per cent.        The first sheath which          was
 prepared for the thermometer, and which was made of impure silver,
was gilt with gold, and tested under the same conditions                        as the pure
silver sheath.        It was found to be not nearly so efficient                a protector
as   the   silver, its readings being generally about                    CT'2   above     the
fan thermometer, or nearly              0°-4   higher than the pure silver.              The
gold gilt     sheath,    after being very much finger-marked, made the
thermometer         read    nearly 0°'5 above           fan, or about half        a degree
better than       clean glass.      As     to  whether gold or silver is the best
for practical purposes can be determined only by continued use.
Gold has certain advantages, as it will probably keep its protecting
powers     longer than silver        ;  and where         frequent cleaning is incon
venient, gold      may be the most suitable;                but when great accuracy         is
aimed    at, silver must be employed.
    The action of        these   silver-coated thermometers is most                 curious
and interesting.          They    never     agree    with any other thermometers
when hung alongside of            each other      in a    room into which the sun is
shining, or in which         the gas is lighted      ;   and even after the windows
are closed, and shutters shut, or the gas put out, it is long before
they   agree with the others.           Like captious critics, they always under
estimate     the   radiations emanating from surrounding                      bodies,    and
manage to keep themselves               cool amidst the heat exchanges               taking
place on every        side.    If  we examine the readings of an ordinary
thermometer, it is influenced by our presence; and                     if long in making
our observation, the          heat   radiated from our body may cause the
thermometer to indicate a temperature half                      a degree too    high  ;  but
these silvered thermometers are almost indifferent                      to our presence,
while they     are sensitive to the temperature of the air.

    The sling       or   "Froude" method of taking observations                          has
generally been accepted          as    the    most accurate        way of determining

 experiments seems to indicate                       that observations taken                  in this war
 may not be correct, owing to a fundamental error in the construction
 of the apparatus.               We have         seen       that radiant heat is absorbed in
 the thickness            of the walls of the bulb, and at the surface                                  of     the
 mercury as well as at the surface of the bulb, and this internally
 absorbed heat must be conducted outwards to the surface before a
 can be carried away by the air through which the thermometer                                                       !--

 thermometers were firmly tied together and slung with                                             as     gres:

 were then compared with each other, and with the fan amngesicci.
The result of        a     number of trials was, that when slung                            in     sunshia:

 the silvered thermometer was                       a   small fraction of        a     degree           higher.

 of course varied with the heat of                      the sunshine.
      These experiments             show us that the ordinary                   sling       thermometer
 in   a   bright day       is   more than 1" too high            ;   probably     it   is1    i*   to    2'   fc»
 high in bright weather, as we                      must remember that the fan inna-

experiments also show us that the silvered sling                               is   nearer the trcu

 nearly with those got by slinging.            From other experiments          made
  in different  states of the weather,    it is found that there is not much
 advantage got by slinging the thermometers, either silvered or clean,
 in sunshine, unless there is extremely little wind at the time. Almost
 exactly the same degree of truth can be got by simply shading the
 thermometer from direct sunshine, and from the sky radiation.
     Another experiment to        test the heating       effect of the sun on the
 sling thermometer was         made    in the following way : — An ordinary
 thermometer was placed uear the mouth of the suction tube of the
 powerful fan apparatus.           First   the thermometer          was    carefully
 shaded from all radiation.        The thermometer under          these conditions
 agreed with the thermometer in the other fan apparatus.                  The open
 mouth of the tube was now directed towards the sky,                 so as to allow
 part of the sky radiation         to fall on the bulb.          The effect was to
 cause this thermometer        to read    a   little higher than the other, and
 when     the tube was    directed so as     to allow the sun's rays to fall on
 the bulb, its indications were more than a degree above the other
 fan thermometer. This shows us that even a powerful draught of
air will not compensate for the exposure of the thermometer to the
 sun, and confirms the conclusion          we have come to that the readings
 of the ordinary sling thermometer          are at least one degree too high.
                   Temperature Observations without Screens.
     We have     seen that,  in taking the temperature of the air, there          are
different methods of operating.           First, we may surround the ther
 mometer with        a screen   to catch all radiant heat, and prevent it
falling on the thermometer,            as is done      in the Stevenson       screen
and in the one shown in fig.          4.   The disadvantage of this method
of   working is that the air in passing over the louvre boards gets
heated before entering the screen, and coming into contact with the
thermometer       ; and though in the screen fig.        4  the louvre   boards are
not     heated by direct      sunshine,    and     the circulation     is kept    up
independent of the wind, still it          can    scarcely be expected to give
correct readings, but must always           be a    little too high.     A   second
method of operating is to cut off all radiation as far as possible,
isolate the thermometer from all conducted heat, and bring to it air
which      has never been    in contact with any solid, and has not there
fore got     heated.    This method has been employed in constructing

t>92                         Proceedings              of the Eoy«l Society
the screens shown in figs. 2 and 3.                              A third method is to                    reduce
the absorbing power of the thermometer bulb,                                 and expose             it    freek
to the air, so that               it   may absorb         as    little radiant heat          as possible,
and make the bulb small, so that the heat received                                      may be       carried
away by the air              as    quickly as possible.             This plan       has been adopted
in the thermometer with silvered bulb.
     In all    these        different methods of working,                    the enemy             we      have
been      contending              with        is radiation,        and     though       we may             have
succeeded in greatly reducing its influence, yet                             it must         be admitted
that    it   has    still    some power.                 Seeing then we have                 been    unable
thoroughly to vanquish our enemy, perhaps                                  the wisest course               no*v
open to us is to see                   if   we cannot make an            ally of    it,   and enlist          it
in our       service.
     We know that                 large bodies are             more highly heated            by    radiation
than small ones             ;     we also know             that different coloured bodies                    art
heated to different degrees                         by radiant     hea^.     Here then             we      haw

or of different coloured                       bodies.     For     the obvious          reason that          the
changes of temperature                        in different sized bodies do not take                 place
                                                                                                              at
the same time, they evidently are not suitable for our purpose;                                             but,
on the other hand, different coloured bodies are.                                  If   we can find         out
the relation between                        the absorbing powers of two substances,                        then
we can, by simply coating the bulbs of two thermometers with                                              these
and noting               their different temperatures,                tell what the           temperature
of the air         is.      Suppose,          for instance,       one substance         heated the bulb
of the thermometer                     twice as much above the temperature                         of the    air
as     the other, then we should                       only require to take the readings                       of
the     two thermometers,                     and    subtract the difference              between         them
from the lowest, to get the true temperature                                 of the air during               the
day, and add the difference                         to the highest,      to get the temperature                at
night.
       In practically carrying out this plan and selecting the                                    substances
 most suitable for coating the bulb,                             one great     object evidently               u

kept in order.               Now in           these respects no substance               is   more    suitable
than glass, and one thermometer ought therefore to be kept with
its bulb clean.  As for the other bulb, something       required                              is

which will heat it twice as much as clean glass when                   exposed to
radiation.       Any other relation in the heating effect would do, but
twice is the       simplest to work with.        Black paint is too powerful ;
but   I  find that coating one half of the bulb with black                  paint   or
black varnish works          very satisfactorily.       The advantage of black
varnish is that it is fairly permanent, adheres firmly to glass,                  and
can be easily renewed         if required.     The black surface ougbt not to
be put     all on the    same side  of the bulb, but should         be  in at least
two sections,        opposite each other, as the radiation from all directions
may not be equal.
    I have     found    the working of these differential radiation thermo
meters very satisfactory, and        it is easily  done.    Suppose, for instance,
the blackened          bulb reads   69°    and the clean      one  68°,    then    the
temperature        67° is easily found.       With practice the      eye     becomes
quickly accustomed to the working of the instruments,                    and easily
gets the     true temperature mentally,         even when      dealing with frac
tions.      These remarks are true only        if the  thermometers are correctly
graduated.         If  the thermometers are not correct, most people              will
require     to note down the readings, and make the necessary                  correc
tions, before adding          or subtracting      the difference.    One point of
importance        is, to be very particular about the reading of the lowest
or clean      bulb temperature, in the day observations, as any error in
it is  doubled in the final result.           For night observations, it is the
error   in the maximum reading that is doubled, and in this                 case also
it is the readings in the clean bulb that have to be most carefully
attended to.
    For experimenting with these differential readings,                  I   selected
 two thermometers which were nearly correct at the part of their
scale   corresponding to the temperature at the time of the observa
tions.      These differential radiation thermometers were placed under
the    same sunshade as the          thermometer        with  the silvered      bulb.
This enabled the comparisons to be quickly made, and prevented the
constantly changing temperature of the air from interfering with the
results.       By watching the differential thermometers till they were
 nearly    steady, then rapidly subtracting the difference in their read
ings     from the lowest       or clean bulb,       the result generally       agreed
 perfectly     with the readings of the silvered thermometer, and never
 differed    by  more than a small fraction         of a degree.

sky, and dear of all surfaces, and so that air could circulate freely
over them. After time was allowed for them to acquire their
respective    temperatures, their readings were again            taken.    They
were then slung and read,          and so on,    a  number of readings being
taken when slung, and when hung               up.    The result was that the
thermometers       read almost alike when slung,          but the clean bulb
always fell   more than one degree         and sometimes nearly two degrees
when hung in the calm air.             This fall  was always   nearly regained
•when slung    ; whereas     slinging did not produce any decided          effect
on the silvered bulb, the        effect  being so small as to be lost in the
changes in the temperature of the air.             These experiments show us
that the silvered bulb is        as suitable   for night as for day observa
tions, and that practically it takes up the temperature of the air.
radiation having but a small effect on it. The differential radiation
bulbs also   seem    well suited for night observations;        but the bulbs
require to   be coated    in  a different   manner from those used in day
experiments,     as the   quality of the heat is then different.

    For travellers,   these differential    radiation  and silver coated ther
 mometers seem to possess special advantages, as they                enable the
observer to get nearly correct readings without screens, because he can
be nearly indifferent       to all save direct sunshine, and       will  be able
with confidence to        expose     his thermometers anywhere,       in  shade,
 where there is a    free circulation of air.
    One result of these experiments is to show us that, even               when
 working with our most accurate methods of observation,                 we have
been regularly overestimating           the temperature of our bright days
 by about   one or two degrees, and in some climates         this overestimate
 may be even greater.        In recording future observations with the sling
 thermometer,     it will  be necessary to say      whether  the temperatures
have been taken with clean or with silvered bulb thermometers, in
 order that the necessary       corrections may be made.
    It is no very pleasant conclusion to an investigation         such as this,
 to find that    it ends in taking         a  degree   or so  off the    average
 maximum of our summer temperature.                Had it been in my power,
 it would have been far more pleasant to add to it a degree or two.
 We may, however, console ourselves with the idea that we have,

 ti96                Proceedings     of  the  Royal Society
so to speak, been simply taking stock of the amount                   of the world's
capital Invested In the heat of our atmosphere, and our Investiga
tion shows    us that we have been overestimating             this quantity,        and
that the produce of the world is obtained by a less expenditure this
 we supposed.

 1.  Abstract of Paper on Micrometrical Measures of Gaseocs
                     Spectra.       By C. Piazzi Smyth.
               [Printed in full, with Plates, in the Trantadions.]
    Ever since the Royal Society, Edinburgh, was                 pleased    to  accept
my paper in 1880, on the general appearance                 of Gaseous Spectra,
as seen on a very small       scale ;   but complete on that         scale from end
to end of the visible     spectrum, — I     have been desirous of presenting
them with some very highly-dispersed              views of the more intricate
portions of those spectra.
    An example in that direction was finely              set by    MM.     Angstrom
and Thalen in the Upsala Transactions             in 1875.       But though      their
work was splendid for Its day, it is not enough to satisfy                         the
demands of theory now.
    These demands, too, are so terribly exacting, that               I  have had     to
labour for several years at continual cumulative improvements of my
private spectroscope,     before it attained power and precision enough
for the present work.         This, however, is the comparative             condition
lately attained.
    My  spectroscope    of 1880 had       a  dispersion of 3°, with a magni
fying power on the      telescope   of   10 times ; say    for the simple       eye «
30° from   A to H.
    The Upsala instrument had         a dispersion   of 24°,  with     a magnifying
power of about the same       ; say = 600°     from   A to H.
    But my present spectroscope        has 60° of dispersion       ;  a magnifying
power on the telescope         rising   to 36 ; with a further mechanical
magnifying    of 5 times.     Equal altogether       to 0000' from         A   to  II  ,

of no  less than 1800 prisms of dense              flint  glass.
   The result of such an immense prismatic power on                        a bright con
tinuous kind of light, such              as that    of incandescent carbon, is to
produce       a   coloured     spectrum     strip,    virtually    120    feet long,    or
stretching all round the meeting hall of R. S. Ed.                     And the regions
or places of its several successive colours will be the places also of
any lines of the same colours which we may meet with in the bright
line spectra       we are about to observe.
                        CJI,  or Carlo-Hydrogen, in Flame.
   Beginning with the compound gas                  CH, in its Coal-gas form, and
burning in a blow-pipe in the open air — very nearly as described to
this Society by Professor Swan in 1856 — the new instrument con
firms all his findings, with the addition of further details.
    There      are,   for example, 5 bands,           widely     separated    from each
other — the       orange,   the citron, the green,        the blue, and the violet.
Each of      these bands is intense towards the red, vanishingly                 faint on
the violet,      side.    Each of the first four bands,             too, is made up of
certain strong Unes and much interstitial and following haze.
    But the new instrument further shows that                     each of those strong
lines is double, and the haze is entirely resolvable into                  a far minuter
class of lines or linelets ; excessively close on the red side,                  but con
tinually widening towards the violet.
   With      each    of those bands     I measured between 80 and 90 of such
linelets   ;  and only stopped then, not because any definite termination
of them was reached, but             because they had then become              too broad,
faint, and hazy to justify micrometrical                   measure      being expended
upon them.
   A  grand constant was however thus obtained, of a useful character,
for reference in certain disputed questions in spectroscopy.                      And if
for sharpness of definition and precision of detail it left much to                     be
desired,      I  endeavoured to supply that by subsequently employing
as the   illuminant, not        flame  of any kind, but the well-known electric
spark of the induction coil.             Even this, however, may           be sometimes
insufficient      for definition    purposes, unless appropriately           used ; for
    The simple induction spark, tried on chloride of sodium vapour in
 the open air, though less hazy than flame, was of a crackly, uncertain

 the solar spectrum.
    The    condensed    induction   spark   filled all the field of view with
 continuous     fervid glow, and quaking           air-hands     almost    fearful   to
 hehold.
    But   a vacuum tube of Hydrogen,         with    a trace   of sodium chloride,
 showed of the latter only the two          D lines,     each   of them intensely
 bright,    exactly   defined, without any stray light;              and, in short
 exactly    as  they    should   be to    serve    any    case    of   Micrometical
 measure.
                    CH   again, but now in Vacuum Tubes.
    Trying the vacuum tube method, therefore, on Coal-gas, the firs;
 tube, though bright enough, was yet a failure ; for it was not bright
 with the     coal-gas   spectrum, but with       a   variety of impurities      an-J
 decomposed materials.         After this, however, had         l)een got over to »
 considerable     extent by increasing the density of the gas put into
 these   so-called vacuum tubes from 0"1" to 2"5 inches of Barometric
 pressure, the Citron and the Green bands of              CH were produced in
a   condition    for examination.      They ran quite parallel with their
blow-pipe     congeners, but were far more          refined  :  the lineleU being
often like exquisitely        thin spider lines, in place of broad hair-
threads.      But they did not last    ; for day after day they grew fainter,
more and more of them became first double, then treble, and then
faded away, lines of pure Hydrogen coming in their stead.
    The leading Orange band of the CH spectrum was particularly
difficult to observe, on account of the intrusion               of these    H lines.
But after having appealed from Coal-gas to defiant gas, and having
increased the pressure of that up to 4 Mercurial Inches, the cynosure
was obtained at last, resulting in what may be termed a perfect view
of the beginning of the       CH spectrum, and of that alone.
    There, for instance, was the Orange band, with its leading Una*
brilliant, and its linelets clear and distinct, though continually widen
ing in distance apart, but in unbroken series not only to the usual place
of vanishing but right up to the strong beginning of the Citron band
   The Citron band's linelets similarly continued in exquisite perfec
tion of gradation right up to the Green band.                     And the Green
band's linelets continued        without    a break, or an         interference,   .«r

foreign intrusion                of any kind, right up to the Blue band, — save,
that shortly before that notable Spectrum                             milestone was reached,        a
faint, but extensive grey cloud                  was passed       !
      What could that mean 1                It   proved to be the then broadened or
hazy condition of the usually sharp line known as Glaucous Hydrogen.
Minute by minute that cloud brightened and narrowed, while the
CH linelets continually paled ; and after an hour's sparking the H,
of the once CH, had come out in lines everywhere ; while its C was
deposited as a brown glazing on the inside of the tube                               ;   and my
beautiful example of               a perfect     CH spectrum was           gone for ever.
      But   if   we bear     in mind how         H    behaved with regard to C therein,
and compare that presently with the actions of                             0 (Oxygen) in the
same relation, the experience                  will   be    well worth the price paid for
it.     For the chemical interpretation                    of those spectra is still under
perfectly radical disputation.
                                       The CO Spectrum.
      A CO       spectrum is easily procured, and with the smallest charge
of either Carbonic Oxide or Carbonic Acid.                              Moreover,   it remains
and even improves by                 use.
      At first sight, the CO spectrum is superficially much like the CH,
inasmuch as it is            a   spectrum of coloured bands, intense towards the
red, vanishing towards the violet                      But there        are more of them, and
they have no leading lines in them like the CH, being composed of
linelets only.
      Moreover,         every such linelet        is of a different constitution              ;   for
¦while      those    of   CH      are weak* and semi-transparent             like spider-lines,
the CO       are hard, sharp, and densely metallic.
      In   fact, in place of both of them being spectra of one and the
same simple element C (Carbon) as usually held in London,       may                       I

principles of the physical world.                      The H, in CH, always trying                 to
free itself from contaminations of every earthy matter ; but the O,
in CO, taking hold of everything near   and of              it,

whereas some other tubes, begun with                       a   different gas, end in showing
nothing but CO.

this earth were touched by the Sun, and so sublimated by its terrific
heat, that     in  a moment      nothing of terrestrial substance would             be
left, except molecules and atoms vibrating in the intense light and
temperature, — the      H    lines would be seen above,           like   a Solar   red
prominence, while the CO would be increasing its domain below.
     But would such      a reproduction         of Nebular    haze   bring back    the

 what was mere haze to smaller instruments is here proved by higher

 and exact mathematical arrangement of lines, without one missing                 one.

     But    if H, in CH,        makes the carbon element behave so very

  spectroscope are multi linear all the way along from                  Ultra Red    u>

  generally an open kind of groupings, occasionally exhibiting exqui
  site specimens of close sharp doubles and trebles, but never enlisted
  into   a rigid band   system.      It   is rather a most free and aerial kind
  of atom dance from        one end     of the spectrum to the other in        a pure
  H    tube.

      Oxygen, on the other hand, is a poor lighter up; and was declared
  by the British Association's Committee's Report in 1880 to have only
  4 lines   in its spectrum, and      those very faint.
      Those 4 so-called lines      I have identified readily enough by place,
  and they are the brightest of the faint appearances               in that spectrum,
  but there      are many others to be noted.             Three also of the first      \

long connected system of rigidly similar triplets, extending all across
the spectrum from Scarlet to Glaucous.             Besides which, the whole
spectrum commences with a notable Ultra Red line which outflanks,
or is further towards the invisible red than any line in any other
gas.
                                     NITROGEN.
    Nitrogen in vacuum tubes must           come  in  here, for though    I may
have some suspicions that          it will  be found   eventually not to be a
simple gas, it is practically so to all present science.
    Nitrogen's      tube spectrum then begins only a very little short of
the Ultra Red line of O       ; and rapidly rises to remarkable and almost
continual brilliance in five long and successive groupings of           10 or 11
 bands each.
     This, in   a general way, has     long been known     ; but what    I  have
 now to add, besides the discovery of the earliest or most Ultra Eed
 group, is the resolution       of  these  bands into lines; into hundreds
 and thousands of lines finer, sharper, and         set more    closely together
 than the lines of any other       gas.
     A  good idea is given of them in the Plates of Orange and Green
 " N,"    now presented to the Society, and like all the other plates are
 reduced copies of my original measures and drawings, lately executed
 for   me by    Mr T. Heath, the first Assistant in the Observatory, and
 who    has   remarkable skill and understanding for such work.
                        Of Elemental Gases Generally.
     If  an elemented gas, such as that of Carbon, or of Iron, can only
 exist   as a permanent gas at the temperature       of the condensed electric
 spark,    it   can   pretty evidently    have for us only the one gaseous
 spectrum due to that temperature ; for man knows no other higher
 stage.
      But  if it  be the case of a gas permanent at all temperatures from
  the lowest to the highest, it may have besides the condensed spark
  spectrum, the simple electric spark spectrum, and also what we may
  call  the cold spark, or the auroral spectrum.
      Each of    these three spectra too,  of one element, must, under appro
  priate circumstances, have its reversal or double           ;  as from   bright
  lines in a dark field to dark lines in a bright field.

 702               Proceedings   of  the  Royal Society.
    There are thus 6 conditions   under which       the spectrum of a per
 manent elementary gas may be viewed ; but seldom more than two
or three or these have been observed by any one.
    Thus with Oxygen, the most advanced of all the gases, —
    (1) Its condensed-spark bright-line       spectrum has been        much
written on by Angstrom,      Thalen,   Kirchoff, Bunsen, Hoggins       ;  and
 the dark reversal of some of these lines is now being worked at by
 Professors Liveing and Dewar.
    (2) Its simple-spark    bright-line    spectrum     is what   has    been
described in this paper   ; but the dark reversal of these lines, either
single or triple, has not yet been accomplished by any one.
    (3) Finally its Auroral, or cold-spark spectrum, though never jet
seen in the bright form, has been long witnessed unconsciously in
the dark variety by every one who has ever noted the huge telluric
black lines in the Solar Spectrum       known    as  A, B, and Alpha    ; the
identification  of the first two of    these  lines with   Oxygen    having
been recently established by M. Egoroff of St Petersburg, by looking
through    a tube of condensed Oxygen 66 feet long, at a bright          con
tinuous spectrum of the lime light ; and the structural ideutity of       the
 3rd, with the 1st and 2nd, having been since then most ingeniously
 worked out by M. Comu in Paris.

    (1) At condensed-spark temperature, and also in the Sun, H's
three grand lines are well known, both in the bright and the dirk
 conditions.
    (2) Its simple-spark multilinear spectrum, in the bright
                                                                       state,
 has been described here ; but the reversal is unknown.
    (3) And of its cold-spark, or Auroral spectrum, nothing        I believe
 is known either in the bright or dark variety.
                            AND OF NITROGEN.
    (1)  At condensed-spark temperature, the report         is the same     a.-
for Oxygen.
    (2) At simple-spark temperature, the bright line form has beea
described in the preceding pages ; but its reversal is unknown.

has yet been positively ascertained cither for bright or dark lines.

   3. On Extensions             of Euclid I. 47.       By A. H. Anglin, Esq.
    In Euclid     I. 47,    it is proved that if regular tetragons          be described
 on the sides of      a   right-angled    triangle, that described on the hypo
 tenuse is equal to the sum of those on the sides containing                            the
 right   angle.     This proposition,        as is shown       in Euclid        VI.  31, is
 only   a particular case of a more general one          ;    and the object of this
 Paper is   to establish the corresponding          result in the case of regular
trigons,    pentagons, hexagons, and generally regular figures of any
number      of  sides,     and finally, in the case of any similar rectilineal
figures, without the use          of ratio and proportion.
    1.  The case of regular trigons or equilateral                triangles     admits of
an   easy and independent            proof, somewhat like that of squares                as
given in Euclid ; but the following general proposition will enable
us to establish the case of regular polygons of any number of sides,
including of     course these two particular cases          : — If     isosceles triangles
of   the same vertical angle be described on the sides                of  a right-angled
triangle    as bases, that one on the hypotenuse           is equal to         the sum   of
the other two.        (A.)
    Let G, H,     P    (fig. 1) be the vertices of isosceles triangles of the
same vertical angle described on the sides of the right-angled triangle
CAB;      then    if D, E, F        be
the middle         points of       the
sides,   GD and PE will          meet
at F, since the line drawn
through      the middle          point
of    the  side     of a triangle
parallel to the       base     bisects
the other side.        Through H
draw     HK    parallel to      GFD,
or    perpendicular          to   CB.                           h

to AB.

  For        a circle may be described about the figure                             HFKB         ; therefore
the angle            KHB     is equal to the angle            KFB.           But    the angle        HBK        is
equal to the angle                    FBM, since the            isosceles         triangles        are     equi
angular          ;   therefore the remaining                  angle       FMB          is    equal    to       the
remaining angle                HKB, and is a right angle. Thus K is the ortho-
centre of the              triangle GFB, and the line GKL is perpendicular to
FB.
  Hence the figure                 FGKH              FG = KH, and
                                                 is a parallelogram, and
therefore the triangle GFB is equal to the triangle BHD, since the
rectangle whose sides are FG and DB is equal to the rectangle
whose sides are              HK    and DB.
  Thus the whole figure                  GCFB is          equal to the whole triangle                    HCB       ;
                                                                      A,

                       Similarly         B + CFA = HN + CN         A              A ,
                                  or       + CNF = UNA.

Now let regular polygons of the same number of sides be                                            described
on the sides of the right-angled triangle, and suppose
                                                                                               R,               be
                                                                                               S,    T    to
the    centres         of the polygons.               By joining             R,    S,  T      to the angular
points of the respective                 figures of which             they are centres, the                poly
gons        will      be divided into the             same number of isosceles                       triangles
which are equal to one another in each polygon.                                             But, since     these
triangles have the same vertical angle, by what precedes
                                       ATAB= ARBC              +   ASCA.
Hence the regular polygon described on                              AB       is   equal to the           sum    of
the regular polygons of same number of sides                                      described on BC              and

      2.    Since the sides of the triangle                    GDK or of HFI                    are equal       to
 FII, DG             and   PE respectively,         it   follows that
                                             HF-'   = DG2 +        PE2,

 and thus the equal sides         of the isosceles   triangles are also the sides
 of  a  right-angled triangle.        Now draw    a line from      B at right angles
 to  CB, and let it     meet    CG produced in     J   ;  then the triangle       BGJ
is isosceles,    BG being equal to GJ, and is equal to the triangle GCB.
 The same being true in the case of corresponding triangles BHO
and CPQ described on the other side, it follows that
                            ABHO= ABGJ+ ACPQ.
But    HB, BG, and CP          are the sides  of  a right-angled triangle ; and
this triangle       being equiangular      to the triangle      ABC, the triangle
BGJ is any       isosceles   triangle  described on BG.          Hence the propo
sition follows in the case of equiangular             isosceles    triangles, one    of
their equal rides being respectively a side        of    the right-angled     triangle.
(0.)
    The case     of similar     segments   of circles described on the sides
may be deduced either            by the application     of result (A) or of (C).
The latter may be employed by inscribing in the circles, of which
the described segments are parts, regular polygons of the same
number of aides, and joining their centres to the angular points of
the polygons       which   are external to the sides of the triangle.            These
joining lines being the sides of            a right-angled      triangle,   it may   be
shown by       (C) that the figure external to AB is equal to the sum of
the    corresponding figures for BC and CA, and therefore, in the
limit, the proposition        follows in the case of the segments-
    It may, however, be more simply shown by the application of                     (A)
directly.      Let AB    (fig. 2) be the hypotenuse
of the right-angled triangle ABC, and ADEB
any segment        of a circle described on     it     If
D    be the    middle point of the       arc,  the tri
angle     ADB = sum of         the corresponding tri
 angles    by (.4). Again, if       E be the middle
 point of arc DEB, since            DB and the cor
 responding lines are sides of a right-angled
 triangle, the triangle      DEB    = sum   of corresponding        triangles.     Pro
 ceeding    in like manner with the arcs DE and EB, it follows finally
 that the      segment     DEB =     sum of    corresponding       segments.       The
 same being true of the segment           AFD, therefore the whole segment
 AFDEB «= sum         of similar segments on CA and BC.                (D.)

right-angled triangles, one of the sides containing the right                                                             angle
being       a side           of the given triangle                     ;       and hence also in the                 case of
similar          rectangles              described on the sides.                        (£.)
     Again,            it follows               from (C),             since the perpendicular                   from         th?

(F.)
   By combining                         these    results we may show the proposition true                                    in
the case of any similar triangles described on the sides.
     For, since              CJ,        the hypotenuse                of the triangle              CBJ,   is double of
CG, and               since        CG, and corresponding lines HB, CP,                                       have         been
shown to be the                           sides      of    a    right-angled             triangle equiangular                to
ABC,        so also              will    CJ     and its corresponding                    lines be the         sides of a
similar right-angled triangle.
     Again, the                  corresponding                sides        in the class of right-angled tri
angle in             (F)      are also the sides                 of        a    right-angled        triangle.        For, if
GU         be        drawn             at right      angles          to        BJ, GUB         is such     a triangle by
what         precedes.                  But GU is half of CB.                              Thus GU            and corre
sponding lines are sides of                               a    triangle similar to ABC.
     Now, let AB                        (Kg. 3)      be the           hypotenuse of the given                       triangle
                                                          ABC, and let the triangle ADB,                              right-
                                                          angled at D, be described upon                            it.      By
                                                          result       (F)       the     triangle     ADB       = sum         of
                                                          corresponding triangles                     on other            sides
                                                           of  ABC. Produce D, and draw any
                                                           line AE to meet    at E.    Then, sioce
                                                                                           it
                                                           AD and corresponding lines are the sides
                            Fig.   3,                      of   a     right-angled          triangle, we         have,        by
                                                           (E), the triangle              ADE        = sum of             corre
sponding               triangles.               Thus       the       whole        triangle ABE         is   equal to         the

    sum of the similar triangles on             CA and CB — and this is any tri
    angle on     AB.     ((?.)
       Finally,   if any triangle, AEF, be described on AE, since AE and
   corresponding      lines are sides of      a  right-angled triangle, it follows, by
   the result last proved, that the triangle            AEF = snm of   corresponding
   triangles   ;  and in like manner for any triangle described on             AF.
      Thus the -whole           rectilineal   figure   BEF   .... A is equal to the
  similar     and similarly described figures on             CA and BC, which is

      It  may be remarked            that the following two interesting results,
 proved      in the      case    of isosceles    triangles, are true for any similar
  triangles described on the sides of             ABC.
     (1)   If perpendiculars        be drawn from the vertices      Q and    P  (fig. 1)
 on the hypotenuse             AB, the parts of them intercepted by the sides
 BC and       CA respectively are each equal to the altitude HF of the
 triangle on      AB.
     (2)   If  CH     meet      AB in N, and HF           be  perpendicular    to  AB,
 then
                               ACGB      =  AHNB+ A CNF,
                      and     ACPA      =   AHNA- ACNF,
                   so that     ACGB      +  A CPA     - A AHB.
 When       ABC is     isosceles,    the triangle    CNF   disappears.

             Challenger           Commission.          (Plate  VlL)
    Some time ago          Mr John Murray kindly placed in my hands the
OfhitjroidEa collected by H.M.S. " Triton" in the Faroe Channel,
with the request that            1  would draw up a report upon them, and the
object of the present paper is to communicate to the Society the
results of my investigations.
    The collection contains no new               species, but one specimen appears
to be a well-marked               variety of Amphiura hellis, Lyman,         a species

708                   Proceedings        of  the Royal Society
discovered by H.M.S.           "Challenger"          in the North Pacific.               This
small number of novelties does not, however, imply that the                           collec
tion is deficient in importance, for, owing to the peculiar                     configura
tion of the sea-bed in this region, every dredging in                     it is  of valne      ;
and when, as in this        case,   the physical conditions are carefully                  de
termined at each station, the result possesses a very great                        interest
for students of the distribution           of animal life upon the globe.
    Before proceeding further,           I  give   a  list of the     species     collected
by H.M.S.      "Triton,"     arranged according to the stations at                    which
they were obtained.
    I have   also had the       opportunity afforded me by Mr Murray                        of
examining the Ophiurids              obtained by H.M.S.            "Knight        Errant,"
already recorded in the Proceedings of this Society,* and                    also a large
proportion of those collected by H.M.S.                  "Porcupine."          These     last
 have been named        by  Mr Theodore Lyman, but                as  no list of       them
has yet been      published, and as reference will              be made to them in
what follows,     I  think it well      to enumerate        them here, although           the
list will   be far from complete,            for the collection to which            I  have

   A description of the       one new form may be conveniently             appended
here, along   with   a few notes upon one or two other species.
      Amphiura bellis, Lym., var. tritonis.               (PL VIL    figs. 1-3.)
   Diameter     of disk,     12 mm.          Arms, long and slender,          11  cm.
Width of arm       close   to disk, without spines, 2 mm.               Two    month
papillae  on either side ;        one    large trapezoidal at the apex of the
mouth angle, one of its sides coinciding                 with the     corresponding
margin of its fellow, the ten papilla? almost enclosing the circle of
the mouth ; the other mouth papilla is at the commencement of the
oral process ;    is acutely pointed           and triangular,    and is succeeded
immediately by a diamond-shaped                scale,  which covers the      opening
of the first tentacle.        A    supplementary        scale was noticed at      one
mouth-angle (fig. 1).
   Mouth shields heart-shaped, one subpentagonaL                        Side mouth
shields   appear to be triangular           ;  they do not project inwards be
yond the median shields, and they meet each other                   in the position
usually occupied by the first under-arm plate, which is absent                    The
other arm-plates are rectangular, with the inner and outer margin*
somewhat rounded ; farther out on the arms they form an angle,
so that the plate is hexagonal         ;   the lateral margins straight and coin
cident with the attached margin of one of the tentacle scales.                   Side
arm-plates slightly prominent              where the spines are attached, not
meeting in the middle          line either       above    or below.     Upper    arm-
platea transversely oval,       but the proximal          margin, instead of being
evenly curved, forms an angle.
   Disk flat, thin, covered with small swollen                 overlapping     scales,
which    are coarser and     radially elongated near the radial shields.
   Radial shields, wedge-shaped, very long, about four times                  as long
as wide,     pointed   at the proximal           extremity,    truncated     distallr,
completely separated        from each other, exoept perhaps at the ex
treme    outer end, by a median               and one or two       lateral   rows of
elongated scales,      Interbrachial        spaces  in the under surface covered
with similar small     scales   ;  three, or sometimes at the proximal end
of the arm four, straight tapering bluntly-pointed              arm-spines.
   Two tentacle     scales, one     towards the axis of the arm, elongated,
semi-oval   ; one  on the proximal margin of the aperture, shorter and
more nearly circular.

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                  717
   Colour, yellowish-grey,         with five rather indefinite radial markings
on the dorsal surface of the disk.
   The typical Amphiura belli* differs from this in having one short
stout blunt papilla on either side of the base of the mouth angle.
   It has also subtriangular           mouth shields,        and the lateral mouth
shields do not meet each other in the middle line.
   The mouth papillae are of           a  different shape.        A first under arm
bone is present, and the tentacle scales of the first                   pair are spini-
form and rather conspicuous.
    This single specimen is worthy of special notice, because the
species has been only known hitherto from specimens collected by
the "Challenger"         at Stations 174, near the            Fiji   Islands, and 232
and    236, off Japan.          It  is interesting        to notice that Asteronyx
Loveni   is also common to the north                 European      seas and     those of
Japan,    and a relation         has been traced by Drs                Gwyn Jeffreys,
and Giinther between the mollusca and fishes of Japan and the
North Atlantic and Mediterranean.*
    Ophioglypha aurantiaca,           VerrilL

    The mouth shield has the inner angle almost a right angle ;
the outer edge is not nearly straight, but with a re-entering angle.
The teeth      papillae    are    usually     four.      As in Professor         Verrill's
specimens, the arms have all been broken ; the longest measured
twice the diameter of the disk.                  The arm-spines are three ; the
uppermost is the longest, and is a             little longer than the arm-joints,
and the second        is about two-thirds            the length of the first;         the
third is still shorter       ;  the tentacle-scale is close to the arm-spines,
and appears      to form part of the same series with them                    ;  there is
 only  one tentacle-scale,      except in the proximal portion of the arm,
 where there are two       ;   where this is the case, the outer is spiniform,
 the  inner    scale   like.      The margin         of the genital       slit is finely
 serrated.    The two or three proximal                  tentacle pores have some
 times three tentacle scales, close beside which                are two small spines,
 about equal to them in size.

 tained in British seas, and its bathymetrical             range is extended from
 400 to 767 fathoms.
    Ophipscolex purpureas.          This  species is also an addition           to the
 British fauna, and its bathymetrical          range is extended from 300 to
 767 fathoms.
    Ophioglypha      signata^   Verrill (PI. VlL figs. 4—8), was first dis
covered by Professor Verrill off the north-eastern coast of the United
 States (100-258 fathoms),*           and has again been recorded by Mr
 Lyman in the Proceedings           of this Society        (voL xi. p. 707).         As
no figure of it has yet been published,                I  have given one on the
accompanying plate.
    Amphiura filiformis.           Bathymetrical        range     extended     to   555

    These few matters of systematic          and descriptive          interest    being
disposed of, we may proceed to discuss the distributional problems
suggested    by the material in hand.          The importance of the Faroe
Channel as a field for zoological investigation             lies, as is well known,
in the fact that there         are  here  two areas not far separated,              and
resembling      each   other in depth and physical            conditions    generally,
save only that in one the average          temperature of the bottom water

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                               719
  is some     10-15° F. higher than in the other.                 We have thus two
  areas   in which all factors influencing            the distribution of animals
  are approximately      eliminated,      save and excepting that of tempera
  ture, so that here,   if  anywhere, we may hope for an opportunity                 of
 determining the influence due to this important factor.
     With the view of investigating             this matter, so far as the Ophiu-
 roid8 are concerned, the table on the next              page has been drawn up,
 which     includes  all the results obtained           by   H.M.S. "Porcupine,"
  " Knight     Errant," and       " Triton    "
                                                  which     are                to the
                                                                  applicable
 problem under discussion.            In    order to render the results strictly
 comparable,      only those stations         are considered       which   are clearly
 within one     area or the other, none,         of course,   being admitted which
 are at a less depth        than the top of the Wyville-Thomson                 Ridge,
 that is, about 300 fathoms.           The depth and bottom temperature of
 each    Btation are given, and the number of specimens obtained at
 each   is shown by the figures in the several columns.
     It will be obvious that in attempting to draw conclusions from
 such a table, the utmost caution must be observed ; the numbers are
 so  small, that any extensive series of dredgings               will be sure to alter
 them very considerably.           For instance, the whole of the expeditions
 together,    prior to the " Triton," only obtained                one   specimen of
 Ophioglypha      aurantiaca,     while only three dredgings on that cruise
yielded together forty-five specimens.
    Still as no further data          are    at present available, the best use
possible must be made of these, it being understood that the results
are   only provisional        It appears then, that while eight species were
found both in the warm and cold areas, six were peculiar to the
latter and six to the former.
    These facts suggest that there are certain forms which                 flourish in
warmer, whilst others are better adapted to colder waters                    ; but in
order to confirm this view, it        will   be well to state what is       known of
the distribution, with respect to temperature, of each of the species
in question in other localities         ;  unfortunately       our knowledge upon
this point is very       fragmentary, because it is only of recent years
that dredgings have been made, while, at the same time, accurate
physical     ohservations     have been       taken, but       such facts as   I have
been able to collect are given        in the following        paragraphs.

prove on further examination to be a new species.
    Amphiura filiformis, has not (except in the instances                quoted     ix
the table) been reported from depths greater than                1 50 fathoms,      so
that it is presumably a warm water species.
    Ophiacantha spectabilis occurs on the Norwegian                 coast, but has
not been met with at depths greater than 100 fathoms.
    Ophioglypha    albida occurs in the British, Danish, and            Norwegian
shallow waters, and has not been known to live at any depth grea^r
than 500 fathoms.        It is found also in the Mediterranean            ;  hence h
is probably a warm water species.
    Ophioglypha aurantiaca,        in addition to the localities noted in         tiw
table, has only been observed off Martha's Vineyard, North-Eas:
America, and at two of the

and bottom temperature, 40° and 39°             -5  F. respectively.
    Ophiothrix fragilis     has    been    obtained at various points on it*
 British   and   Norwegian       coasts,   from     depths   not   exceeding      150
fathoms, so that in        default    of precise temperature          observations,
it may     be regarded as a species         proper to warm rather than cold
 water.
    Gorgonocephalus eucnem'w was found by the

 at two localities, at both of which the temperature of the water                 w«>
 below the freezing point     ;  and it is also found off the coast of Green
 land, so that obviously        it  has   no more     claim to be considered          a
 warm than    a cold water species.
    Ophiacantha abynsicola, occurs off the Lofoten Islands above the
 300-fathom line, which is within the warm area, as determined by
 the Norwegian North Sea explorers.               It has  also been dredged          n
 one of   the "Blake"      Stations,     E.S.E. of New York, from            a depth
 of 304 fathoms.      Bottom temperature, 49°-5 F. (9°7 C).
    Ophiobyrsa hydride and Ophiomyxa serpentaria, have at prefer.:
 only   been found   in the localities noted       above.
    Ophiopus arctictui, is known from Spitzbergcn and Norway dowa
to the 400 fathom line.
    Ophiaciis   Balhi   is found     in shallow      water off the British and

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                              723
Scandinavian          coasts,   and in the North Atlantic, 40-50 fathoms;
except       in the present instance it           has not heen       found below 150
fathoms,        which    distribution would          seem to indicate      that it is   a
denizen        of warm    as well as of cold areas, and should by rights be
placed among the species             " common to both areas."
     Ophioglypha Sarsii has also been obtained by the " Challenger
                                                                                        "
off the east coast of North America at one station (49, depth 83
fathoms,        bottom temperature         1°"8 C. [36°    F.]), and at four stations
by the        " Blake,"   at depths varying          from 44 to 306 fathoms, and
bottom temperatures 40°           -5  to 51° F.      It  has also been obtained off
 the coast of Greenland, in Smith's                Sound, and off Spitsbergen, so
that     it would       appear to       be at home both           in cold and warm
 waters.
      Ophioeculex glacialU occurs also off Spitzbergen and the Arctic,
 European,        and American        seas generally.        It  was dredged by the
 "                        "
     Willem Barents           at two stations; at both of which the bottom
 temperature was below the freezing point, so that it may be regarded
 as a   well-marked      cold water species.
      From these additional data it would              seem that the species classed
 as    " peculiar to the warm          area
                                            "
                                               have established for themselves a
 fair claim to that designation          ;  while of those marked         " peculiar to
  the cold area," two {Ophiactit           Ballii   and Ophiogtypha Sarsii) must
  be   removed to the category of
                                           " common " forms.
      We have remaining then six forms peculiar to the warm, four
  peculiar    to the cold, and ten common to both warm and cold water,
  a   result which decidedly favours the conclusion                  that temperature
  is an     important    factor in determining           the distribution of these
  animals.
      Having ascertained to what extent the Ophiuroid faunas of the
   two areas     of the Faroe Channel differ from               each  other, it will  be
   interesting to examine how they are severally related (1) to the
   shallow-water forms of surrounding regions, that is to say, to those
   from the     British and Norwegian          shores    down to 200 fathoms;        (2)

            forms of more northern seas (Greenland, Spitzbergen, Barents
             and   (3) to those inhabiting the cold water off the north
    eastern   coast of North America.

   When this list is compared with those given in the preceding
table, it is found that every form mentioned therein occurs also off
the    Norwegian       coast,    with the exception of three              species   (Amphiura
bellis, var.,       Ophioglypha     aurantiaca,             and 0. signata)       from distant
parts    of the world, and two {Ophiobyrsa hystricis and Ophiomyxa
serpentaria), described from single specimens in this locality.
      Of those which        are also found        in    the   British shallow water it will
be seen     that three      are among those             peculiar to the warm area, two
are    common, and two are peculiar to the cold area.                             Of    these last,
however,       it   must be noted that Ophioglypha                     Sarsii     has   only   been
found in British seas in moderately deep water off the Shetlands                                      ;
and    if we   exclude this as a doubtful inhabitant of our shallow water,
it would appear that the British coast forms are more nearly related
to those     from the warm than those from the cold                       area.
      With respect to the Norwegian                    coast forms no such relation can
be     traced, which may            probably           be     explained    by the fact that
Norway, with its great extent of indented                            coast-line with islands
and fiords, has a great variety       of physical conditions, and                            so pro

    In the first     place,    it must     be noted that the water         in which    these
species were found            is not cold as compared with the cold water
of the Faroe Channel            ;  the lowest temperature, that namely of seven
stations at which Ophiacantha                bidentata was obtained, being SS'-SJ)*
F.; while the remaining stations                    range    from 40J°-51° F., which
is as high on the average             as  the greater part of the warm area of the
Faroe Channel.           It  is seen, too, that whilst five species are common
to this coast       and the warm area of the Faroe Channel,                        just the
same number          are common           to it and the cold area.             So that we
have no ground          for asserting that the fauna of this                coast   is more
intimately      connected         with the cold         area    than   with the warm;
indeed,     one haul of the dredge might                  suffice   to turn the balance
either way.
     I  understand       that the study of other groups of animals                        has
 shown such      a  relation to subsist, but we must await further investi
 gation for any decisive evidence on the part of the Ophiuroids.

 The Relation of       the     Ophiuroid Fauna           to the   Nature of the Bottom.
    While investigating            the     "Triton"      collection, it occurred to          me
that results of some interest might be obtained by attempting to
trace   the n>anner         in which the Ophiuroids                   are  distributed with
respect to the nature of the bottom.                        It was obvious at the outset
that such an inquiry would be beset with great difficulties, owing to
the impossibility of entirely eliminating                    the influence of the depth
and other conditions.
    As   a   preliminary         step,     the distribution         lists of >Ir Lyman's
 " Report on the Challenger Opbiuroidea " * were analysed, the indi
cations as to the nature of the bottom being taken from a revised
list of stations which has been prepared for publication in the
"Narrative of the Cruise of H-M.S. 'Challenger.'"                                The results
are expressed       in the accompanying                table, in which are given the
number of dredgings which were made upon each deposit, the number
of cases in which Ophiuroids were obtained, and the relation of the
latter number to the former expressed as a percentage                          —

    The most striking fact presented by this table is that Ophiuroids
are not commonly             mot with on those deposits which are charac
teristic of great depth, such as the red clay and Globigerina oose                              ;
while they       are  frequent upon the shallower                    bottoms made up of
coral mud and the blue and green                       muds which are composed               of
continental      detritus      ;  in other words, it shows (especially when
taken in connection with the elaborate bathymetrical tables given
in Mr Lyman's Report) that,                 as a rule, the abundance         of Ophiuroids is

cludes the possibility of other factors influencing                     their distribution.
    It  is clear, then, that the only way of obtaining                      any satisfactory
evidence on this point           will    be to take groups of different                deposits
of the same depth, and compare them with respect to their richness
in Ophiurans,        In many      cases the range       in depth of the deposits is not
sufficient to allow of this          ;  but in   some few instances            it is possible.
    For example, dredgings were made on red clay at depths varying
from 2250 to 3875 fathoms, and on Globigerina                           oozo at from      1090
to 2650        fathoms ; so that           we    may take         for comparison          those
 instances of each which lie between 2250 and 2650 fathoms.
    Within      these   limits of depth the result is found                to be —

         Number of dredgings,                               .     .      .19
 Whence      it   would     seem that Ophiurans               are nearly      three times as
 widely spread on the red clay as on the Globigerina                         ooze.
    These figures are so strikingly at variance with those                            obtained
 from a consideration         of the whole voyage that it is quite clear that
 there   must    be some flaw       in the argument, which is probably to                    be
 found in the fact that the Globigerina               ooze stations under considera
 tion are     the deepest      examples of that deposit, while the red clay
 stations are the shallowest           ; and from the general law of distribution
 according to depth, above alluded                to, we should          expect some such
 result as this to take place.
     None of the other deposits offer any adequate number of stations
 at equal depths      for comparison        ; so that    it would     seem that at present
  we have no sufficient data on which                  to base any safe conclusions
 as to the influence         of the nature of the bottom on the                    presence   or
  absence    of   these    animals, although        it is highly probable that such
  an influence is exerted.
     Possibly future investigations            may make us acquainted with two
  areas which, being comparable              in other     respects,    differ in the nature
  of the deposits forming their bottoms.
     In conclusion,       I must express my indebtedness to                    Dr P. H. Car
  penter for a quantity       of valuable information from his journal relative
  to the dredgings      of H.M.8. "Porcupine," and to Mr Theodore Lyman
  for his courtesy in answering some questions which                    I addressed to him.

that same character.

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                              731
promptly replied that         he could solve        it very briefly by quaternions.
(See ante, page 575, footnote.)              I  myself soon after succeeded in de
vising a solution, and my object in the present paper is to offer that
solution      to the     Society.     Prof. Tait      too,  I   trust  will submit his
quaternion solution this evening to the Society.
     Let us take the        case   of three points moving rectilinearly               and
mutuo-proportionally          relatively      to    a   frame.      Throe    points    are
enough, but we might              use   more, and       might so bring       out varied
solutions     ;  and besides it may be mentioned here that                 a distinction
of importance         will be found     to exist between the results attainable
for three points only, and for a greater number than three.                          This
will    be referred to at a later stage (near the end of the paper,                pages
740 and 741).
     Let these three points to be used be called in general A, B, and
C,    irrespectively      of changes     in their mutual configuration,             or in
their     situations relative      to any      frame.     Let    us proceed   to find    a
frame relatively to which any one of these three points, say the
point C, shall be at rest, and the other two shall move rectilinearly
and mutuo-proportionally.              Let     sucoessive    simultaneous     situations
 of   A and B at instants of measurements                   be designated as     Aj   and
 Bj , A2 and       B3 , A3 and B3 , <fec. We may thus bring into considera
 tion and into use a set of portable triangles AiCBj , A.jCB2 , A3CB3 ,
 and more       if wanted, representing severally in forms and dimensions
 the   likewise designated original triangles             ; or,  it may   be, represent
 ing the originals in form, while constructed on any convenient scale
 of dimensions.          The  use of such altered scale is to be understood
 as   available    if the  full original    sizes would      be inoonvenient      for  use
 in   a kinematioal       diagram, or mechanism, soon to be explained for
 construction        or ideal contemplation.           After this     mere   mention of
 allowable change of soale, the explanations                 will generally    be given,
  for brevity and simplicity,        as  if the lengths of lines in the diagram,
  model,    or mechanism, were identical with those of the corresponding
  original lines, rather than on an altered soale.                   We may denomi
  nate    these    several portable       triarjgls   in succession     as templet      1,
  templet 2, &o.
      Let   us place the corners        C of the three templets together, and
   take any plane passing through C, and bring                    the three lines CA1 ,
   CA2, CA3      , into that plane.       Then take       a straight line to be called

732                  Proceedings of    the Royal Sdciety
AA, movable in that plane; and, by motions of the lines CAlt
CAa , CA3 , together with the motion of the line A A itself if neces
sary, bring the templet points Aj, Aj, As, into the line AA.
Keep, until further      notice, the line  AA   at a constant distance from
C.    This last bondage temporarily applied (that of keeping            AA    at
a  constant distance from C) is introduced merely as an aid in the
reckoning of freedoms, and of their successive abolitions.           It is not
essential, and for some possible varied modes of thought         it may well
be omitted.
    The figure here illustrates     the arrangement so effected.       It  is to
     A
be understood that we are to suppose          ourselves free from any donbt
as to whether, at the instant of any measurement, the           moving point
A   or B, as the case may be, is diminishing or increasing its distance
from C    ;  for instance, we are to suppose       that we are    fully aware
at which side of     M  in the line  AA  we are to place the point    A,  ; the
the line    CM   being the line of shortest distance from C to      AA.
    Next take another straight line to         be  denominated as B6, and
 place  it passing through Bt and        B2 wherever these     templet points
 may happen to be.           Then rotate templet A3CB3 round its side
 CA3 till its side CB9    ,  regarded as an interminate straight line, comes
 to meet the line    BB which itself is movable, and may, if necessary
 or desirable, be shifted while retaining       the points   B, and Bs in     it
 This operation may be stated in other words as being the operation
 of bringing the templet line CB3 into the plane of B, and B4 and C,
 or, what is the same,      into the plane of the point C and the line BB

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84                                                     733
holding in it the points Bj and B2. Now, in general, on the accom
plishment of this, we shall have the three points Bj , B2 , and Bs , not
in   one straight line, though       all in the plane of Bj              ,   B2    ,   and C.         That
is to say, the lineBjB2 will cut the interminate line CB3 , but gene
rally not in its point B3. But now, rotate templet 1 round CAt or
templet 2 round CA2 till B3 kept in the plane BjCB2 comes into the
interminate straight line BjB2 , or, what is the same, into the line
BR         So now we have attained            to the following state of things,
videlicet : —
     Firstly. Line AA is kept at an unchangeable distance from the
point C.
     Secondly.      Three    templet points     A}   ,   A2   ,    A3    , are          kept      in the
straight line      AA   ;   and three other templet points                    B, ,      B2   ,   B3   ,   are
all situated in one straight line BB.
  Under these conditions, without departing from them, and while
considering the point C and the line AA, and consequently CAj ,
CA2   CA3 , as being all at rest, we can move any one of the three
       ,
templets by rotation round its line CA ; and the other two will be
bound to move with that one, and to assume fixed places when that
one is     fixed   ;— or,   in other words, motion or             rest   of all the three is
exactly decided by motion or rest of any one templet.
                   Two Varied Methods          for Continuation.
     Having arrived at this         stage, we may go forward                       to accomplish            a
solution by either of two branch methods which                               will      be stated now
successively.
   Method I. — The state of things already arrived at being main
tained, if now further we introduce one more templet A4CB4,
placing its point C to coincide with the C of the previous templets,
and bringing its point A4 into the line AA ; and if we rotate this
new templet round the fixed side CA4 as an axis, and move also, if
we please, or if necessary, the line BB in the freedom it has, and
carry on either or both of such motions  till we get the interminate
line CB4 to meet the interminate line BB (that        in other words,        is,
till we get CB4 into the plane of and BB) the point
                                             C               will not                    B4
in general find itself in the line BB (but BB will meet some point
of CB4 other than            B4).    Let   us, however,           while maintaining                       the
arrangements         or conditions    already arrived at, shift the line                          BB in

734                     Proceedings        of the Royal Society
the freedom it possesses         till   B4 comes into that          line BB, and then       let
us make that conjuncture              binding for the future.
    Now all will be clamped or locked completely during our                              main
tenance of the temporarily employed condition of                         AA   being kept    at
an unchanging distance from C.
    Next    release    that condition        and shift         A A to any new        distance
             will follow that BB will be fixed in a new situation ;
from C, and it
and, for AA moving, BB will be bound to an exact movement
accordingly.
    But now introduce              of the templets, templet ASCB5,
                                one more
with its point A5 brought into the line AA and kept bound to
remain in that line, and with its line CB5 brought into the plane of
C and BB.      This being done, the point                     B5   will generally not     find
itself in the line BB; but we can shift                        AA    towards or from C,
moving consequently the plane                CBB and          the line   BB in that      plane
till the line BB       gets B5 entered       into   it
    Thus all is completely clamped;                 and the two straight lines of
motion of the points        A and B relative to the desired frame in                     which
C is at     rest, are found          relative to each one of the configurations
ABC at the         successive        instants of the measurements.                 But   those
past configurations of the points             A, B,          and   C, are already lost to
us ; and so we must proceed                to find the         lines AA and BB relative
to one or more future configurations of those three points which                           are
the only things that are to be available to us to make measurements
from.      It   is here to be distinctly noticed that the lines of motions
AA     and BB, being fixtures in the desired frame, may perfectly well
be accepted       as constituting        that frame      ;   or even one of them along
with     the point    C (which is       also a fixture       in the desired frame)       might
equally well be accepted             as constituting         the desired frame.
   Now we have to observe that, from the nature of the data, and of
the operations performed in the kinematical model or mechanism,
                                      it,
and result arrived        at    in    it     must be the case that the lengths
AjAj, AjAg,  ASA4 &c, and B,B2, B2B3, B3B4, &c, found in the
model as representatives of simultaneous travels of the real pointi
A   and    B    relative to the desired frame,                must be mutually propor
tional.     Hence, by continuing forward for the future                       a   toke propor
tional    division along BB for any arbitrarily marked                             graduation
along     AA,   we can    by measurements           from the model foretell future

instantaneous           configurations of the points                           A, B,           and    C, and the
situations of         the fixed lines               of motion       AA         and BB relative to those
future configurations.                     So at any future                instant when one of those
prophesied configurations arrives, we shall have the means of speci
fying relative thereto the lines                          AA     and     BB     ;   and these, as already
explained,         are to he accepted                   as the desired frame               ;   that   is,   as heing
a   frame accomplishing                   all the requisites of the problem.
    Method II. — Eeverting now to the                                  stage arrived            at just before
our commencement of branching out into the two varied methods,
and maintaining the state of things there attained                                             to, we may pro
ceed    by   a    second alternative method as                           follows — It:           is   to be recol
lected that,in the state of thing3 attained to, we have three templet
points      A, A3 all in one straight line AA and three other
             Aj,        ,         ,                                                      ;
templet points           Bj
                         ,    all situated in another straight line BB
                                     B2,   B3,                                                                      ;
and that, while keeping the line AA at        changeless distance from  a
the   point C, and regarding the line                           AA     and the point             C    as being at
rest, and consequently regarding the points A1                           A2 A3 as being also
                                                                                ,        ,      ,
all at rest, we can keep moving                           the line BB, in the one freedom                          it
possesses, and          so we can            alter continuously the distances BjB2 and
BjBj,       and we may readily                      further      see     that we can             alter continu
ously the ratio of either of these distances to the other.                                              So let us
ordain the requirement                     that we are thus to keep moving the line
BB     in   the freedom           it   possesses         till   we attain the condition                 that   :—
                                 As AtA2        :   B,B2   :
                                                           :     AjA3      :   B^B,,   .
For the purpose of accomplishing this requirement we may use
(ideally at least) mechanism of parallel rulers or parallel pro
                                 a
jectors,     &c, which will now                     be    briefly described.                   For guidance in
geometrical principles towards formation of the conceptions intended,
imagine      a    straight        line placed intersecting                      the lines        AA     and BB.
Let    us name this               line as the transversal, or refer to                           it   as the lino
TT.         Imagine the points               Aj A2, A3,
                                                    ,                  to be projected to the trans
versal      by parallel projectors                  ;    and imagine the points so found on
the transversal to be                  further projected to the line BB.                                    Call the
points so found              on BB, the points                             b2, b3,       in correspondence
                                                                   blt

         ,
                 A2 ,   A3   ,
 Now obviously we have by geometry,

Further it may easily be                    seen         that we can               gradually change         the
directions (or clinures) of the two sets of parallel projectors until                                       «

dence we can go on changing                        the directions of both sets of                    parallel
projectors        till we  to coincide with B?

                                                                                               Bj

The general principle thus indicated can be applied                                            to the      case
immediately             before    us    in    a     simplified         combination            by    choosing
to    make        the     transversal             pass    through          the       points    A3    and     B,
as    in   fig.    2,     where   TT        represents the             transversal             The       figure

the paper,         of lines       and       points        not themselves                situated     in     the
plane of the paper, and not all existing in any one plane.                                               Then
take   a   pair of straight            lines kept              parallel       by mechanism           (as
                                                                                                            for

 These two pnrallel lines are represented                   in the figure      as AjBj   and
 Aj  ts .    So now we have, in the figure,
                            AjA2   : Bj<2   : :
                                                 AXA3     :  BjA3   .
Take two other straight              lines    kept parallel         by mechanism, and
place one       of them     across    from    t2   to B2 and make the other pass
through A3 , and then it will               necessarily meet the line BB.                 So
these two parallel lines will be represented in the figure as f3B8 and
A3i3 ; and we shall have :
                                   —
                            AjAa    :  BjBa    : I
                                                    A^ B^    :       ,
Now in general         it will result that       b3
                                                     so found     will not coincide with
B3 ;   but let us now keep the line BB moving in the freedom it
possesses,      and keep the two pairs of parallel lines maintaining the
conditions to which they have been set, and continue the motion
until the points         b3
                             and B3 come to coincide, and bind these two
points to remain together ; or, in other words, bind the line A863 ,
when      brought to     pass through      the point B3 hitherto movable along
the line     BB,   to continue holding the templet point B3 . Thus all will
be clamped        as long as the temporarily           imposed condition of change
less distance from the templet             point C to         AA  is maintained.
   But if now we change that distance, and fix on                         a new changeless
distance       instead,    while   maintaining           all    the     conditions   already
attained      to, the whole system will take up                a  new configuration      and
will become clamped therein.
   Or we might express this by saying                   : — Fix AA        at an altered dis
tance     from C, and by going through the same process as before we
get   one fixed configuration for the whole system.                         So if we relax
the condition of changeless distance of                        AA      from C, the whole
system has one and only one freedom.
    For the next step we do not require another complete templet.
"We may use merely the lengths CA4 and CB4 got                            by measurement.
That is let       us have a portable triangle           with two sides CA4 and CB4
given, but the angle between them left unknown, and that, for our
 present operations, is the same as to say : — left variable.                       Put the
 vertex C, or joint C, of that portable triangle at the point C of our
 model.         Bring CA4 into the plane CAA, and swing it round till A4
 comes      into the line AA.           Also put the rod or bar CB4 into the

the mechanism of parallel rulers, &c, already                  used,    but with      som;
obviously necessary additions sufficiently suggested                   by  the  explana
tions already given.         Xow the whole       system      becomes clamped, and
 the problem is solved,       or the rest is easy      as  in Method        L,  the two
straight lines    AA    and BB, being lines fixed in the sought-for                frame,

    It  becomes now convenient and desirable to examine into                         some
 questions   as to  how many distinct        elements      of data from measure
 ment,    or how many ascertained          conditions from measurement,                 are
 required for the solution of the problem            ;   and as to whether          there
are more essentially distinct solutions           than one in various          cases of
the number of points used and the number of conditions                              from
measurement       ascertained.
    It  is to be recollected, as was pointed out near the end                    of    the
 explanation     of Method      I. that the lengths AjAj, A2A3, AgAp &Ci
 and BjBg, B2B3, B3B4,        &c, found in the model as representatives of
simultaneous travels of the real points                A   and B relative        to    the
 desired frame, must be mutually proportional.                   But    the conditions
 of this mutual proportionality have been left unused in the solution,
 and   so we may see      that in Method     I.  we have        used redundant data.
 It is to be understood that the introduction                  of any one complete
 templet brings in just two not three new conditions.                    Though for it
 there are three       sides   measured,    yet the only conditions thereby
 ascertained are that when some one side has               a   certain stated    length,
 a second side has another ascertained           length, which is one condition,
 and that also at the same instant the third side has another                       ascer
 tained length which is another condition              ;  and this makes with           the
 previous one only two in all.

common            to both Methods         L   and       II. ;   we have — (a) templet 4 intro
duced        involving two additional                   conditions from measurement,                    and
(b) templet 5 introduced,                 involving two additional conditions from
measurement                So in respect           to these two templets 4 and 5 we
have four conditions              introduced.
  And in the whole of Method I. there                                 are the       following known
conditions unused : — ¦
                                     That

That        is,   in all, three known conditions unused.                                 So instead of
ascertaining           4   conditions      hy measurement and neglecting                              3,   we
might get             the result    by     4   —   3,    that    is   one      new condition            from
measurement.               Now in Method                II.     we do demand from measure
ment      just one new condition, and                     we have no redundant                  informa
tion.       The one new condition               so introduced           is   the condition brought
into use       by the incomplete templet    videlicet, that when CA
                                                                 4
                                                                 ;
has     a   certain stated length CB has another certain ascertained
length.
    So,     on the whole, in Method                     I.    we have from            measurement          5
templets supplying two conditions each, that                                 is,   we have 10 condi
tions       from       measurement;           and,       as      shown       already,     we    are     thus
supplied with              3   redundant       conditions        ;     and so        10-3      or   7   con
ditions from measurement, or independent                                data, must somehow be
enough.
    Passing to Method              II.    we see that in          it   we have       3   complete tem
plets supplying            6    conditions, and           1     incomplete          templet supplying
1   condition; and we have got no redundant conditions; but we
have      just    7   conditions found necessary and brought into use.
    So the two methods agree                   in showing that the number of inde
pendent conditions               from measurement necessary                         to be supplied         is
teven.

     There is yet a curious matter which            I  have to adduce for conside
ration.      Many matters of interest may indeed remain for further
consideration or for mathematical investigation in connection with
this 8uhject      ;  but   I do not   at all profess to exhaust the subject,          and
I shall    only be glad       if it be found     that   I -escape   from offering in
advertently any importantly erroneous views.
     What    I do      propose now further to put forward is some scrutinies
as to whether           the problem entered on, in some               of its   varieties,
admits of duplicate or multiple results for accomplishing                    its condi
tions ; and to open out some views in relation to this matter which
appear to be true and to be of interest.
     It is to be   noticed that when we begin putting together our templet*
for the kinematical model or mechanism for three original moriiw
points     A, B, and C,        we   have no means        available   for knowing        on
which side of templet 1 we are to place the point A2 of our templet
 2, and on which side of the same we are to place the point B, of
our templet         2.    Further, it is to be noticed that, under the           restric
 tion of our measurements being confined to three of the original
points      only, we have no means whatever                  for making       the   extr»
measurements, or taking the extra observations                    that would supply
us with means for choosing one side rather than the other of                         ten>
plet    ], as that on       which we ought to place either As or                By.     To
 help our conceptions            let us imagine among the original               moving
 points a reference frame relative to which the original point C shall
 be at rest and which shall have no rotation                relative to the original
 secret frame ; and let us name             this  as the vice-original      frame      and
 designate     it briefly by the letter *. Let us imagine the original
 triangular plane ACB as having one of its two faces red and the
 other blue     ;   and imagine its face which at the point            A  is anterior in
  its motion relative to the vice-original frame to              be red, and the one
  which at that point is posterior to be blue. In               respect to this it     a to-
  be noticed that the red face thus specified though anterior at                   A n»y
  happen to be the posterior one at                B :  but this need not gire           ns
   trouble, and for brevity we may speak of the red face which at A a
  anterior as being the anterior face.             Let the   faces   of all the   templet
  triangles be coloured red and blue correspondingly.
      By going forward with considerations readily suggested by                      what
 has just been set forth, we may obviously find that the process of                  «ol»

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                             741
   ing the stated problem for the      case of   only three original points by the
  kinematical      mechanism can bring out two straight lines            AA    and  BB
  really at rest relatively to the vice-original frame, and consequently
  having all their points either at rest or moving rectilinearly and
  mutuo-proportionally        in relation to the original secret frame : and
  further that the        same   process    of solving the stated problem           can
  bring out another real true solution in finding two straight lines
  which    we may call      A'A' and B'B' which will be the images of AA
 and     BB in     a   plane mirror whose          plane   always    passes   through
 the three points A, B, and C.              The two straight lines A'A'          , B'B'
 so found may be taken as lines                fixed in a frame which         we may
 designate      as  *', and which will rotate relatively to the vice-
 original frame       4>,  as also   relatively   to the original secret        frame.
 Now,      as the motion       of the original points       goes   on making their
 distances apart increase         unlimitedly, this relative rotation between
 the    frames    *'  and   *   will  be becoming       evanescent,    and the two
 frames will      be approaching       unliniitedly towards relative        rest.    So
the solution whioh brings out the frame <£' approaches ultimately
to identification with that which brings out the frame <£ which is in
agreement       with the original     secret frame.
     If  now instead of using the three points C, A, and B, we use                    a
different      group of three points C,         A, and D,      these  will bring out
for us     as solutions two frames <U+2666> and                 of which the one $ will
be identioal with the frame          <I>already   found    by the three points C,
A,    and B.       It follows from this (and it seems very obviouB that it
could     be brought out in various other ways), that for four original
points no frame in general could            be brought out as a solution except
one in       agreement    with the original      secret  frame   ; that is to say, a
frame either at rest relatively to that original frame, or having all
its points moving rectilinearly and mutuo-proportionally relatively
to that original frame. One reason which seems very decisive in
favour of this conclusion is : — that if any three of all the original
points be retaining their distances apart unchanging, then these
three will themselves constitute a frame * which will be in agree
ment with the original secret frame : and then for any other one or
more of the original points taken along with                 these three, no frame
•will be possible to serve         as a solution     except such as shall be in
agreement with that one.

                                             Postscript.
  The ideas noted in what follows had not completely occurred to
me till after the evening of the meeting of the Society when tlw
paper was read,              and a suggestion towards their development                         cam*
from Professor               Tait's    paper of the same evening
                                                                                  " On     Reference
Frames."            Thus it     seems suitable to annex them here as a postscript
     It       may be noticed that in the case referred to in the last                       sentence
of the paper just before this postscript — the                          case   of   three original
movingpoints retaining their distances apart unchanging                             — the method
of procedure employed throughout the paper would collapse because
the points A and B would be at rest relatively to the vice-originil
frame, and so the straight lines of motion                          AA     and      BB   previously
used          would become         only two points.           Yet   a   solution is in this        case
even more readily available than in the previously considered                                   cases.
It   thus becomes desirable to find some way of harmonising                                   the two
modes of thought or                   of procedure      so as to    bring them into           connec
tion      ;    rather than to be content to suppose that, in passing from                           one
to the other, we should                    have quite to abandon the one                    mode     of
thought, and take up another and quite unallied mode instead.
     A        satisfactory     connection         between the two presents itself,                   if.
instead of taking from the kinematic model only the lines of                                  motion
AA        and BB, as the basis for our desired frame, we take from that
model also the points                 Aj   and   Bt   on those lines, getting them known
by measurement of their distances from any future points A.                                         and
B„   ,    so that when,            among the three original              points     A,   B,   and    C,
the particular          configuration            A„CB„ found in anticipation               from the
model shall           oome to exist,             the old triangular        frame A,CB,             shall
beoome           known to       us relatively         to the then existing frame A.CB,                     .
In this          way of procedure, the solution, for the case of                         A     and       H
being, as well as             C,   at rest in the vice-original           frame,    will    come out
simply by the distances AnA1 and B„li, being each zero in length,
and by the concomitant of this, that the old frame A,CB,    to b*                             is
found as being coincident with the new momentarily existing sad
known frame AnCBn                  .

          2. Note on Eeference Frames.                                     By Professor Tait.
     As    I   understand Prof.               J.       Thomson's       problem (ante, p. 568) it is
equivalent to the                following : —
     A    set of points           move,       Galilei-wise,         with reference to              a   system of
co-ordinate      which may, itself, have any motion whatever.
                      axes   ;
From observations of the relative positions of the points, merely,
to find such co-ordinate axes.
     It   is obvious that there is an infinitely infinite number of possible
solutions      ; because,          if   one       origin moves Galilei-wise                   with respect to
another, and the axes drawn from the two origins have no relative
rotation, any point moving Galilei-wise with respect to either set of
axes will necessarily move Galilei-wise with respect to the other.
Hence any one solution                        suffices,      for all the others can                be deduced
from it by the above consideration.
     Referred         to any one set of axes which satisfy the conditions,                                      the
positions of the points are, at time t, given by the vectors
                        aj +            for   A    ,    aj + P2t for B       ,    &c, &c.
But it is clear, from what is stated                              above,    that we may look on the
pair of vectors for any                   one          of the points,            say    at and     )8j   for   A,   as
being absolutely arbitrary                    :— though, of            course,         constant.         We will,
therefore, make each of them vanish.                                  This amounts to taking                   A    as
the origin of the co-ordinate system.                                The other expressions,                above,
will then represent the relative positions of                                     B,    C,   &c, with regard
to A.
     The observer on               A     is    supposed to be able to measure,                             at any
moment, the lengths                     AB, AC, AD, &c.                 ;    the angles            BAC, BAD,
CAD, &c.              and also to be able to recognise                           whether     a   triangle, such
               is ;
as   BCD,             gone round          positively or negatively when its corners are
passed through in the order named.                                 What this           leaves undetermined,
at any particular                instant,         is    merely the absolute direction                      of any
one line (as          AB), and the             aspect of any one plane (as                     ABC) passing
through        that line.           These being assumed at random,                                     the simul
taneous positions of all the points can be constructed from the per
missible observations.                    But          it   is   interesting       to inquire          how many
observations are necessary                    ;    and how the             /3s   depend on the as.

we have equations such as follows               : —
                  -a-a*+2So4/3s.            t + pA
                  - b = Sa^ + S(a^3 + 0A)               . / +           .  f*
                  -c   =
                           <$ + 2Sa3P3,t +
For any      one value of t we have n equations of each                      of the let  and
3rd of these types, and n(/i           -  l)/2 of the 2nd, »        + 1    being the while
number of points.             In all, n(n + l)/2 equations.
   The scalar unknowns               involved     in   these    equations are (1)         the
values of     t ;    (2) aj,    <£, &c;     (3) (%, /8J, &c; (4) 80,0^ &c.; (5)
           &c;      (6) Sa^2,        SajjS,, &c; and (7)             S^,       +         &c
Their numbers are, for (2), (3), (6), n each;                         for (4), (5), (7),
n(»-l),'2      each;      in all 3n(n    +  1)2.     Suppose that observations are
made on m successive             occasions.      Since our origin, and our unit, of
time are alike arbitrary, wo may put                  t = 0  for the      Grot observation,
and merge the value of t at tho second observation in the tensors of
     /33,  &c.     This amounts         to taking the interval between the first
two sets of observations             as  unit of time.         Thus the unknowns          of
the form (1) are m           -2   in number.       There are therefore
       mn(u + 1)      2  equations and       2>n(n +   l)/2  +  in  -2     unknowns.
Thus    ?)i = 3   gives     an insufficient amount of information, but               m  =  4
gives a superfluity.
   In particular, if          there be three points only, which is in general
sufficient,   3 complete        observations give
                           9  equations with 10 unknowns;
while    4  complete observations give
                           12  equations with      1 1  unknowns.
Thus we need tako only two of the threo possible measurements,                             at
the fourth instant of observation.
   The solution of the equations, supposed to be effected,                         gives  us
among       other things,        aj, aj, and      SctjOj.    Any direction         may    be
assumed      for   a2,  and any plane as that of              a,2  and ay        Fom   these
assumptions, and the three numerical                    quantities      just    named,   the
co-ordinate    system required can be at once deduced.

similar     cases        of failure (when they are really                                      cases         of failure)          are
due to an improper selection of three of the points.                                                            We need not
further discuss them.
  But it is interesting to consider how the vectors fi can be found
when one position of the reference frame has been obtained.   Keep
ing, for simplicity, to the system of three points, we have by the
solution of the equations above the following data                                                      :   —

from which they were derived were not linear, have in general more
than one system of values.                               The second, third, and sixth of                                      these

 3.   Note on the Occurrence of Drifted Trees in Beds of Sand
          and Gravel                     at Musselburgh.                        By James Geikie, LL.D.,
          F.R.S.
   1   am indebted to                    Mr William Robertson for calling my attention
 *°                                                                                                                        of this
      the      interesting               phenomena                which form                   the subject

746                       Proceedings              of   the    Royal Society
communication.                Some        months ago he showed me at his                        works,
Hayniarket, the trunk of                  a large oak           which had been        obtained from
beds of sand and gravel in his property                               at Olive Bank,           Mussel
burgh.          The wood was very dark in colour, and in a fine sUte                                    of
preservation.            It   was,      in fact, in     process     of being sawn into          plank*,
from which a number of useful and ornamental articles have                                         since
been made.             The trunk was perfectly straight, showing no                             appear
ance       of branches, and when first uncovered measured 31                                    feet in
length, having           a diameter           of   2    feet    at the butt      end close      to the
roots, from which it tapered upwards                             very gradually.         The portion
seen       by    me    in Mr Robertson's premises had been                              more or       leas
scraped by his workmen, and the bark was almost entirely wanting                                             ;
but    I   was informed             that very little bark appeared when the                           tree
was disinterred.              The roots were somewhat rounded, and                           looked is
if   they had been rubbed and abraded.                            Shortly afterwards          I visited
the sand-pit, and saw the trunk of another large oak in situ.                                   It wu
only partially uncovered, the portion concealed being buried under
some 10 feet of sand and gravel.    The trunk was hollow and filled
with wet sand, and the wood                         was so soft        that it could         be cut in
most places with a spade.                      The       greatest     diameter of the          exposed
portion         was 3 feet      9    inches, and when the trunk was finally dot
out it was found to measure                    18 feet         in length.      But Mr        Robertson
informs         me that, before the time of my first                        visit to the      sand-pit,
the workmen             had dug away a considerable                         portion     of   the dark
brown soft woody matter, under the impression that this was merely
" peat," and he estimates the length of the part                                   so removed           »*
not less than 30 feet, and thinks the trunk at its butt end could not
be less than 5 feet           in diameter.              This would give          a total length for
the trunk of 48 feet.                    It   was not so straight             as No.     1    tree, and
unlike      it,   it   had several branches.                    Most of the bark             had     been
removed from the tree before the time of its entombment, but                                         some
still adhered in places, and was covered with                                a   foliaceous lichen.
Here and there also the trunk was thickly set with the stems of                                           »
clinging or climbing plant, which may have                              been     ivy.   I      did    not,
however, detect any leaves of that plant                          ;   but in the hollow of             the
trunk  I        picked    out       a   few leaves         of    holly, and other             vegetable
mutter which was too decayed to allow of identification.                                           Since
this   tree was exposed,             other two have been extracted.                     One of       these

                                                                                                                     H   iff
                                 of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.
resembled No.                1    tree   in the soundness of the wood, but                               the        trunk
was     hardly         so straight,         and it had several branches.                               At       1    foot
above the roots it measured 20 inches in diameter, from which it
tapered upwards for 26 feet to a diameter of 1 foot, after which it
bifurcated, the two branches measuring                                          16 feet 6 inches and 6 feet
6 inches            respectively.          There were smaller branches also hoth on
the main trunk and on the two principal branches.                                                      The fourth
tree    I      did not           see   in situ, but in Mr Kobertson's                                premises.           It
measured 2 feet 7 inches in diameter near the root, but bifurcated
at about            4 feet 6 inches.              Only           one        of the two limbs, however,
remains,            and it         measures       18 feet               4       inches     in length.        It      also
bifurcates,           the        branches     measuring                     18     feet    and    15    feet,        with
diameters of 9 inches and                     7   inches respectively.
     All       the trees were more or less soft and spongy externally, the
soft wood being readily                     removed by                      a    spade     to the depth             of an
inch or more.                They        seem to have been               for the most part deprived
of their bark before they became                                  buried in the sand, and the worn
and abraded             character of the roots and branches was just such as
we see         in    trees       which have been drifted                           some     distance     in water.
It     remains         only       to add that the trees                         were lying with their                butt
ends     directed inland.                  Nos.           1   and 4         I   did not     see   in situ, but the
others         I took the direction           of, and found that the top of No.                          2   pointed
E. 20  N.; and Mr Eobertson informed me that No. 1 had the same
direction.  No. 3 tree lay N. 5 W. or nearly north and south, the
 top being            directed seawards.                       No.      4, again, appears            to have had
very much the same direction, the top being directed a few degrees
 more to            west     of north.            I           may add, that                the four trees            now
 referred to occurred within a dozen                                        yards or so of each other, one
 of the branches of the great hollow trunk (No. 2) lying across No. 3
 tree.  Scattered through the sand in the neighbourhood of the
 trees, many twigs and branches were seen, some                                             of which may have
 belonged            to those particular                      trees ;    it is quite possible, however,
 that      a   portion of the vegetable debris may have become entangled
 in the        roots and branches of the snags as it drifted seawards.
       The succession of deposits seen in the sand-pit is in descending

   The Sand (a) is a moderately fine-grained siliceous 6and, seen
only in the north part of the sand-pit.                It dies out rapidly to the
south.     The granules       are often coated        with hydrous ferric oxide,
and the bed becomes quite ochreous towards the north.                      Xo fossils
seem to occur.        The bed is overlaid by         a mass   of   " made ground,''
consisting of sandy soil, in which fragments of very recent pottery and
glass are seen.
   The thin       bed of peat     underlying this sand is in like              manner
restricted to the north        end of the pit.         It occupies    a  hollow,   and
dies out rapidly to north and south.                 Both it and the overlying
sand abut against the subjacent gravel and sand in such a way                     as to
show     that    the latter had been considerably             denuded before the
accumulation        of the peat     and upper        sand-bed     had   commenced.
There is nothing particularly          noteworthy       about this peat, save that
it seems to be made up to a considerable                extent of the remains of
trees, such as birch, elm, Scots fir,           &c     Here and there      I detected
the wing-cases of beetles, and possibly other organic remains may
occur,    for   I  made     no   special    search.     Both this     peat   and the
overlying sand-bed are evidently of much more recent date than the
gravel and sand below, and it is to these specially that attention is
at present directed.
   The deposits in question            have been excavated to a depth of
8 or 9 feet, and how much            thicker they may        be  I  cannot say, but
the boulder-clay        will probably     be met      with at no great        distance
from the bottom of the sand-pit           ;  and possibly the sand and gravel
do not attain      a  greater thickness       than 20 or 30 feet            The beds

exposed        in section     are somewhat variable, and show a good deal of
diagonal bedding, pointing to somewhat persistent current action
from the south ; in a few places, however, there is evidence of a
movement in quite the opposite direction. Although the deposits
show so much false-bedding, the inclination of all the various
lenticular heds and            sheets of gravel and sand          is towards the north
at a low angle, between 2° and 3'.                     The sand     is chiefly siliceous,
 and remarkably             "sharp"      or   clean,   and it greatly predominates
 over the gravel.            Some    layers    are very    fine,   others are    less  so,
 passing      into a grit. The gravel consists of well water-worn stones,
 varying in size from mere grit up to fragments several inches in
 diameter.           Coarser    and finer gravels alternate in             lenticular   or
 irregular layers and beds, which               interosculat.3   with lines   and sheets
 of sand.         So far   as  I have   observed,     there are no rock-fragments in
 the gravel which do not also occur in the boulder-clay of the same
 district,     and very few, if any, that might not have                   been   derived
  from the drainage-area of the River Esk, which enters                    the sea about
  half    a mile to the east of our section.
       It  is in   these gravel and sand beds that             the drifted trees occur.
  They were         met    with at or about the bottom of the section in the
   sand-pit, and all within a distance of 40 feet of each other.                      The
   absence      of any trace of marine organisms in the                 beds,   taken    in
   connection with the presence of the drifted trees,                   branches,   twigs,
   &c., suggests         the fluviatile origin       of the deposits,     and the same
   might be inferred from the general appearance of the deposits them
    selves.      All  the evidence points to a flow of water from south to
                                                                                  "
    north.      The inclination of the various layers, the " pitch of the
    diagonal bedding, the shape of the gravel stones (well water-worn, but
    not generally so well rounded as marine gravel), the manner in which
    the stones often overlap, and the general disposition of the materials
     precisely    resemble what we see         in the   recent alluvial    accumulations
     of our larger rivers, and in certain older valley-terraces laid down
     by many of our streams at              a  time when these flowed in greater
     volume than at present.           The deposits at Musselburgh            occur some
     30    feet   above    Ordnance      datum-line,      and form part of        a broad
     terrace which slopes gradually inland to a height of as near as may
     be 45 feet.       Indeed, the 50 feet contour line may bo taken as the
      boundary      of the gravel and sand,            the terrace formed by        which

truncated by the modern cut of the Esk (see fig. 2). At Monk-
tonhall they again come on, forming well-marked features — the
terrace sloping gradually        down to the more recent           alluvium of the
Shire Haugh opposite Inveresk.                 The counterparts of this sloping
bank and broad terrace are also met with on the east side of the                  Est
Thus, they are well seen between the river and Inveresk, from which
they may be followed down to              a  little beyond the Waukmill, after
which the bank sweeps away to the east by Inveresk                         House and
Pinkiehill Colliery, until eventually it turns north by Pinkie                   Brae,

 Musselburgh      Links.     It  may be added that this last-named               beach
has been      excavated    in our old        terrace,  across   its whole breadth
from west to east, so that in descending seawards                    from the bank
which forms the margin of the 45 to 50 terrace, we first traverse

that terrace, and then reach the short slope or bank that overlooks
the 25 feet beach and the modern alluvia (see fig. 3).                    And just as
the deposits of the 25 feet beach pass            up the valley of the Esk into
well-marked      haughs of river alluvia,         which gradually         ascend   with
the slope of the valley ; so, when we follow the deposits of the
older terrace inland we find them in like manner rising to a gradu
ally higher level, and behaving in every               respect   like ordinary river
alluvia.     There cannot, therefore, be any doubt,               I  believe, that the
sand and gravel which contain the drifted              trees are of fluviatile    origin
— accumulations        formed by the Esk, at       a  time when that river flowed
at a higher level and in considerably greater volume than at present.
    Since   the upper      or 45-50      feet terrace was formed the Eiver
Esk    has   cut its way down through            that terrace       and the boulder-
clay and carboniferous strata to           a depth of some 30 feet ; and the
greater size of the Esk when flowing                 at the 45-50 feet level is
indicated not only by the character and bulk of the deposits then
laid down but by the much wider              area over which these extend.              I
think it is also    suggested     by the great size of the drifted trees, which
could hardly have been floated seawards by such                      a stream    as the
modern river.
    It is  of  some   interest now to inquire what relation this ancient
alluvial   terrace bears     to the raised beaches         which occur     at so many
different    places on both sides      of the Firth of Forth.            From what      I
have    seen   of those old    sea-beaches    I have little doubt that the tree-
 bearing beds referred to in this communication               are on approximately
the   same geological horizon         as the    well-known 45-50 feet beach              ;
 that, in short, the sand and gravel in which the great                     trees occur
 were     deposited     at  or near     the mouth         of the Esk, when            the
 sea-level    stood    some     45  feet higher        than    it now      does.    This
 appears     to be    shown by the fact that             the   upper limit       of the
 terrace at Musselburgh         preserves the same level when followed from
 west to east across the valley of the Esk, and hardly begins to show
 any rise when traced up that valley until we reach Inveresk.                          In
  short, the deposits at Musselburgh           seem to me to resemble the delta
  accumulations      of a very considerable river, and             it is just possible
  that  some   of the current-bedding       seen    in the sand-pit at Olive Bank
  may be the result of tidal action.              But the body of fresh water
  flowing seaward would be sufficiently great to prevent the incursion

of marine organisms,         and   the absence      of any trace of these            is  v
proof that the land may not then have                 stood, relatively to the          sea.
some 45 or 50 feet lower than           it  does at present
   It  is in the upper reaches of the        Firth of Forth that the 45-50 feet
beach     is best developed.         In the neighbourhood of Falkirk                    a»l
Stirling    the deposits    of this level form the well-known              Carse-lands
— extensive      sheets of mud, silt, clay, and sand, containing                in   many
places     recent    sea-shells,   such    as   Cardium      edide,    Ostrea      edviit,
Cyprina islandica, Littorina litorea, Trophon elathrattis, Buecinnn
undatum, &c.         The upper limits of this great flat are well marked
out by bluffs and banks — the old coast-lines.                 Of its marine       origin.
therefore,     there   can be     no   doubt.      Now,     throughout      the     C*rse-
deposits     there    occurs   at   various     levels much        drifted    vegetable
debris, consisting of the trunks, branches, and twigs                of such     trees as
birch, hazel, pine, and oak, and associated with these oyster-shells
often appear in abundance.            Remains of the whale,* dug-out              canoes,
and rude implements and weapons                have likewise been discovered              in
the same deposits, while along what was the old shore-line kitcben-
middens are frequently           met with.        All the middens, as        Mr Peach
observes,
              " occur on the bluff itself or just at its base, as            if when it
was the     limit of high-water,       the people      who formed the middens,
after searching      the shores during low-"water, had retreated thither to
enjoy their feast while           the tide covered         their    hunting-ground."
It  is noteworthy that when those Carse-deposits                 are followed up the
valley, they are found rising with a gentle gradient, until eventually
they pass into fresh-water alluvial              deposits    of sand and       gravel of
fluviatile origin.       Here, then, at the head of the Firth of Forth,                  we
meet with the counterparts of the Musselburgh beds.                      The   evidence
shows that at a time when the sea washed                  the   45-50    feet level the
River Forth, flowing in much           greater volume than at present, carried
down to its estuary           enormons      quantities of drift-wood,           some     ol
which got bedded          in the sand of the lower reaches                of the    river,
gome     in the silt and mud of the estuary,                while much no          doubt
found its way eventually out to the open                   sea.    The Musselburgh
   *
      Professor Turner informs me that the skeletons of large whales, which
from time to time haTe been found embedded in the Carse-deposits of the Forth
valley, so far as they have been critically examined, have been determined r»
belong to the genus BalccnopUra, and are not examples of the BaUrna mysHcttvi,
or Greenland whale, as is generally believed.

   beds, then,      I  take to be of the same age, and to betoken the same
   conditions,      as are shown       by the old fiuviatile accumulations of the
  Forth at the point where                these   merge    into the estuarine-marine
  beds of the Carse-landa
      It is  remarkable that precisely the same phenomena are met with
  in the lower        reaches   of the Tay valley.          In that district, however,
  the succession of          changes     evinced by tho Carse-deposits          and the
  correlative      fiuviatile accumulations           of the Tay and Earn, is even
 more clearly read.            In   the Carse of Gowrie, for example, we detect
 underneath         the clay of the Carse the remains of an ancient buried
 forest.      The lower portions of the Carse-deposits are often abund
 antly charged with drifted vegetation, and here and there marine
 shells occur.          I got oyster-shells and drifted wood in the Carse-beds
 a   few    years     ago,  during     some   excavations that were being made
 within the grounds of the Perth Penitentiary.                         But no marine
 remains have been met with higher up the valley, for as the deposits
 are traced further in that direction they pass gradually into fiuviatile
gravel and sand.             That the Carse of Gowrie, &c, is of the same age
 as that of Falkirk, may be inferred from the fact that its upper
limits reach the            same     elevation,    viz., 45 feet.    I  may add     that
underlying the buried forest of the Tay and Earn valleys fiuviatile
gravel, sand, &c, are seen in some places.                         These phenomena,
which      I have described        at length elsewhere,* seem to me to indicate
the following succession of             changes   : — Taking first the fiuviatile  beds
under the buried forest,             these point     to a time when the Tay flowed
at a lower level than at present — for the old fiuviatile beds referred
to occur underneath the present mean tide-mark at and below Perth.
Hence we may further              assume that       the land stood relatively to the
sea somewhat higher then than it does now.                        Next in succession
comes the buried            forest.     This,  as  I have   shown, represents an old
land surface which extends out seaward, and consequently proves
that the Scottish shores formerly stretched much further to the
east.      I   need     not recapitulate the evidence which has led me to
believe      that the buried         forest of the Tay valley finds its counter
parts    in    the    so-called submerged forests which are met with                  at
many points along the                shores   of these    islands  and the opposite
coasts of the Continent            ;  and that the evidence furnished         by these

 754                  Proceedings        of the  Royal Society
leads to the conclusion that at the time those forests flourished,               the
British    area   formed      a   portion   of the European      Continent,     and
enjoyed    a more    genial climate than at present.           The buried fore:
of the Tay is covered by the Carse-clays which               are  indubitably     of
estuarine or estuarine-marine formation.               Consequently      they sho*
us that the continental           conditions    during which the great forests
extended themselves had now passed away ; more than this, we
may infer from the appearances               presented by the Carse-clays       and
correlative river deposits of the Tay and the Earn that the climate
had now become less genial               The river-gravels referred to are     more
or less coarse tumultuous           deposits extending over broad areas, and
when they are followed into the Highlands they are actually found
in  close   association with torrential debris and morainic               accumuL
tions.     Again, the Carse-clays have all            the  appearance of      those
flood-loams and clays which are deposited by                 water flowing from
suowfields and glaciers         ; and now and again they contain isolated
stones    and boulders      which could only have been carried down                W
sea   by river-ice.      So that, at the time the clays of the Carse oi
Gowrie were accumulated, it would appear that local glaciers occupied
some of the     Highland glens, while our rivers had often             a  torrential
character, and swept down to their estuaries immense quantities of
fino silt,  "the flour of rocks."            Thus, as it seems to me, we have
more or less    distinct evidence in the Carse-deposits of            the Tay and
Earn of marked geographical and climatic              changes.
   Eeturning now          to    the   Carse-accuniulations    of the Forth,       wt
encounter very much tho same appearances,                but certain evidence      ii
wanting.      Thus     we    have not yet encountered any          ancient buried
forest underlying      the Carse-clays of       Falkirk and Stirling, which     can
bo considered as the equivalent of the buried forest           of the Tay valley.
But    we have every evidence             to show that an arboreal vegetation
similar to that which now forms our forests, clothed the hill-slope*
and valley-bottoms in the region drained by the Forth, at the                  tin>?
the Carse-clays began to form.                We have   proof also of torrential
and floodod rivers, and of the wholesale destruction of trees.                    No
geologist    who has studied the Carse-beds of the Forth can doubt
that those accumulations occupy an old valley, the bottom of which
is under the present level              of the sea.    Nor   does   it take moch
imagination     to picture to one's self the conditions        which must hare

obtained in the Forth district at the time when the buried forest of
the Tay stretched away out to          sea. In  place of the fiats of the
Stirling and Falkirk Carse and the waters of the estuary of the Forth,
we    see a broad and gently sloping valley clothed      with thick forests,
through which the ancient Biver Forth winds far away to the               east,
to mingle its waters in all probability with          those   of the Rhine,
which at that time flowed northward through the           area now covered
by the North       Sea.   How long those conditions      obtained we have
no means of estimating, all one can say is that it was probably at
or about that time that Neolithic man entered Britain. These geogra
phical and climatic conditions eventually      become    changed.      Britain
is insulated, and a cold, wet, and ungeuial climate supervenes.            The
forests decay more or less rapidly, while marshes and bogs extend
their boundaries.        Local glaciers exist in   Rome    of our mountain
glens, and flooded rivers carry seaward the           trunks and branches
 of many      a  fallen  monarch   of the forest.    The    sea at   this time
 washes the 45-50 feet level, and along the shores             live Neolithic
fishermen who revel in a molluscan diet, and now and again succeed
in capturing a whale.
     Such,  I  believe, were the general conditions that obtained during
the accumulation of the gravel and sand with drifted trees at
 Musselburgh.        The   peat and sand which overlie the tree-bearing
 beds    belong to a much more recent time ; but whether they are
 older or younger than        the 25 feet beach    there is no evidence to
 show.     I  need   hardly add that the deposits of the 45-50      feet beach
 are   of post-glacial age, — being younger than the estuarine-marine
 deposits of the 100 feet terrace,      — which   latter, as   I  have shown
 elsewhere, must be classed as of late glacial age.

    I had hoped to be able, during the winter, to extend my observa
tions to temperatures           near   the   freezing       point,   but    the lowest
temperature reached by the large compression apparatus was 6°-3 C.J
while the highest is (at present) about 15° C. From so small a
range     nothing   can  be expected as to the            temperature effect on the
compressibility      of water,      further than         an   approximation      to its

        3.   Critical Note on the latest Theory in Vertebrate
             Morphology.          By Mr      J. T. Cunningham,          B.A.
    In  the attempt to trace the vertebrate organisation by comparative
 anatomy and embryology back to a simpler state, the origin                     of the
 limbs    has   been    made    the subject of various hypotheses.               Many
 years ago Gegenbaur brought              forward     a   method of regarding the
 morphology of the limbs, by which each could be derived from a gill
 arch supporting       a series  of gill rays, from such       a system as forms the
skeleton      of a gill in a typical Selachian         of the present day.        This
comparison        was instituted     without any particular         stress being   laid
 on the relation of the ancestral vertebrate                 to  invertebrate forms.
 He supposed that the central ray of the                    series  in the branchia
gradually grew more prominent, and                 as   it increased in length the
rays near it lost their attachment to the arch, and               became articulated
to the sides of the central ray : in this way he obtained an imaginary
limb skeleton which he called the Archipterygium.
    This theory is usually supported by reference to the structure of
the limb skeleton of Ceratodus. The shoulder girdle of this animal
is an arch of cartilage more or            less ossified,    with the upper end of
which the free limb articulates.              This linib is composed of an axial
rod of cartilage broken up into          a series  of short   segments,   and on each
side of this cartilaginous axis a series of cartilaginous rays is situated             :
each ray articulating with one of the segments of the axial rod.
    Tn another Dipnoan,          Protopterus,     there is a still more striking
indication of the relation between limb and branchia.                          In  this
animal      the shoulder       girdle, as "Wiedersheim          pointed    out, has   a
deeper position        than it has in other fishes, a position             in relation
to the surface of the body similar              to that of the branchial         skele
ton.     In   the second     place, the shoulder girdle of this animal bears
throughout       life functionally active external gills ; and thirdly, not
 only the shoulder muscles, but the whole limb as well, are innervated
 in great part by branches of the vagus nerve.
    On this hypothesis of the morphology of the limbs, the original
 position of the limb would have been such, that the plane in which
 it was expanded was vertical           to the longitudinal axis of the body,
 as it is  in Teleosteans and Ganoids.            But in Selachians, although in
 adult life the plane of the limb               in most      cases   approaches this

position, in the embryo the limb grows out in                                  a   plane parallel         to
the axis of the body             ;   and as there is every indication                      that to tie
Selachians we must usually look for the most primitive                                       condition
of vertebrate organs, this is a strong argument against Gegenbaars
hypothesis.          Based on        a   study of the development                   of the limbs          in
Selachians, is the view of the morphology of the limbs advocated
by Thacker, Mivart, and Balfour, and especially supported by                                             the
researches      of the latter.            According          to this view, which              like       the
branchial hypothesis of Gegenbaur, makes no attempt to bring                                             the
supposed original           condition          into relation          with the organisation               of
any invertebrate form, the two pairs of limbs in fishes are the                                     speci
ally modified remnants of           longitudinal fold, which originally nn
                                          a
along each          side of the body, and was similar in structure to the
median folds from which the unpaired fins are derived.                                        The     em-
bryological      facts     which support              this    view are briefly thus.                     In
Selachians      the first rudiments           of the paired fins appear as slight
longitudinal ridge-like              thickenings of the epiblast similar to the
rudiments of the unpaired fins.                      There are two such ridges on                    each
side — one anterior behind the last branchial arch, one posterior                                        on
the level of the cloaca.                 In   most Elasmobranch               embryos, especially
in Torpedo, they          are connected by a line of columnar epiblast                              cells,
which very soon           disappears.           The    presence       of this connecting ridgt
is suggestive of the original continuity                     of the two fins, on each               side.
As the fin grows out mesoblast extends into                            it,   and in the mesoblist
appears     embryonic          cartilage, which breaks up into                        a   longitudinal
series    of rays,       and    these         are    continuous        at     their   base        with    ^
longitudinal         bar termed by Balfour the basipterygium.                               From      the
anterior end of this longitudinal cartilage there pass off an upward
and   a   downward process, which form the rudiment of the limb girdle.
The longitudinal bar may                      be due to secondary development,                           tht
series of cartilaginous          rays being the primitive part of the fin which
is   thus reduced to the same structure                        as an unpaired              tin.      The
pelvic     fin in   a   Selachian never departs much from the primitive ar
rangement, the only alteration being that the basipterygium segment
between the anterior and succeeding ray, and the posterior end                                            oi
it   segments    off as the terminal ray.                  In the pectoral fin the charu^
are more extensive         :   the basipterygium             is   rotated outwards from               the

that part of the adult fin called metapterygium by Gegenbaur, and
then becomes segmented off from the pectoral girdle articulating
with its hinder         edge.    The propterygium        and mesopterygium          are
merely the anterior part of the original basipterygium                which divides
into two     pieces, articulating      directly with the pectoral girdle.        Thus
the metapterygium          is the homologue of the basal cartilage of the
pelvic fin.       It   is obvious      that the facts of the development           dis
covered     by Balfour       are absolutely      incompatible    with Gegenbaur's
view of the origin of the limb from                a branchial  arch and its rays.
According to Gegenbaur's view, the limb of Ceratodus is the most
primitive form, and the metapterygium in the Elasmobranch
corresponds to the           central axis      in Ceratodus, the posterior rays
having disappeared.            The development of the fins in the dog fish
shows that the metapterygium                is the basal part of the fin grown
outwards, and could never have borne posterior rays.
    In  the earliest sketch of the genealogy of vertebrates put forward
by Dr Dohrn in 1875,* he also maintained                      that the vertebrate
paired limbs originated from gills, not gills constructed on the plan
of   those   of   a  fish of the present day, but branched             tree-like gills
resembling       those   of living annelids, such, for example,           as those   of
Arenicola piscaiorum.           He supposed that special muscles first became
separated from the dermo-muscular tube, in order to move the gills for
the sake of more efficient respiration ; that then the gills began to be
used as locomotive organs         ; and finally, when respiration was confined
to the anterior gill slits, two pair of these gills were preserved, and com
pletely changed into locomotive organs on account of the suitability of
their position for keeping the equilibrium of the cylindrical body in
the water.        The assumption in this view, that a limb was originally
a process of a single somite of the body, could not                   well  be main
tained in face of the facts of the structure and development of the
fins of fishes.        In  Elasmobranchs it is obvious that         a  lateral fin be
longs to several somites of the body, not to a single one.                     Balfour
found that the muscles of           a   limb in an embryo Elasmobranch            were
derived     from buds of several muscle plates, that               is from several
somites.       In  a recent paper     f   on the orgin of the paired and unpaired

  fins of Selachians,      Dr Dohrn abandons his former view,               and gives
 a detailed account       of the origin of the musculature of both             median
  and paired fins.       He confirms Balfour's       statement of the origin of
 the musculature of the paired fins from buds of the muscle plates,
 and extends the same to the unpaired fins.                  He also      shows that
 muscular      buds, similar     to those which form the muscles                of the
 pectoral fin and pelvic fin, are given off in those myotomes                   which
 belong to the part of the trunk               between    these,    but    afterwards
 atrophy.      This fact confirms Balfour's view, that the              pectoral and
 pelvic fins were originally continuous.           He then shows         that muscle
 buds similar to those which form the muscles of the pelvic fins                    are
 given off behind       the anus, forming      a continuous      series   with those
 belonging to the pelvic fin       ; and that from these the muscles of the
 anal fin are derived.         From this, he     argues    that the anal fin has
 been formed       phylogenetically     from the ventral      coalescence      of two
 lateral folds continuous with those whose remnants form the pectoral
 and pelvic      fins.     The   reason    why   coalescence     has    taken place
 posteriorly, and not in the region anterior to the anus, is that the
 gut has disappeared from the posterior end of the body, and not
 from the anterior pre-anal part.           The gut is shown by the existence
 of the embryonic post-anal gut to have originally extended to                      the
 posterior extremity of the body where the original                anus was, while
 after the formation of the present anus,            a secondary structure, the
 posterior part of the gut disappeared, and then by the reduction in
 size  of the ventral part of the tail,      the two lateral folds were brought
 together and formed the median ventral fin.              He further shows         that
 the musculature of the dorsal median fin arises               from muscle buds
given off on each side from the dorsal ends of the myotomes, and con
 cludes from this, since similar ventral buds form two lateral fins, that
 the dorsal fin was also orignally derived from the coalescence of two
lateral fins.      The effective   cause   for the coalescence     here was, in hu
opinion,     the folding over of the original          flat plate of the central
nervous system to form a canal.              Going  one    step further back,        be
supposes      each  of   these  four lateral folds, composed as they are, of
buds from successive segments,             to have been originally a series of
separate    processes ; and then he points         out that we have an animal
similar    to an annelid, each eegment           bearing a pair of notopodia,
and a pair of ventral neuropodia.

     To trace the supposed transformation            in the  reverse order,   it is
thus.      The original    annelid-like      ancestor first of all changed its
position in locomotion,       so that its      nervous   system became       dorsal
instead of ventraL       Then, by the folding over of its median nervous
plate to form     a tube, the      two series     of neuropodia were brought
together, coalesced,    and formed the dorsal fin of the fish.
    The animal having obtained           a  new anus some distance from the
end of the body, the posterior             part of the intestine     disappeared,
being no longer    f untional  ;   and by the consequent reduction of this
part of the body, the posterior part of the two             series of notopodia
coalesced in the median line and formed the anal fin.                  Anteriorly
the successive notopodia united in two separate regions to form the
pectoral and pelvic fins, and in the intermediate region disappeared.
    In  the course of my observations on the development of floating
 Teleostean   ova,  carried on in the month of June last,               I was im
 pressed with the incompatability          of Dohm's ingenious theory, with
 the existence of a pre-anal ventral median fin in the larvae of one
 species.    The larvas in question were hatched in the Scottish
 Marine Station at Granton, from transparent floating               eggs obtained
 by   means of a fine tow-net       in considerable numbers, about        50 miles
 east  of the Isle of May.       I   do not know at present to what fish the
 ova belong, but as the ova and embryos are well characterised, they
 may be identified     at some future        time with eggs taken from some
 ripe adult fish.     The yolk in both the developing ovum and the
 hatched larva is extremely pellucid,           and divided    into  separate  por
 tions with polygonal outlines         : there are no oil-globules in the yolk,
  the notochord is composed of a single column of vacuolated cells in
  the formed embryo, and in the larva the anus is situated at some
  distance from the yolk-sac and close to the posterior extremity of

by Von Hensen.                 This relation           is   as follows, and                       shown          in the
woodcut.           The median fin extends continuously                               along the median
dorsal line round              the end of the tail                     to the        anus, and passes
continuously          from thence to the yolk-sac, having                                  about the same
breadth throughout.                  There       is   no break in the fin at the anus, as
the latter opens on the edge of the fin, the terminal portion of the
intestine projecting downwards                        from the trunk.
   There      is    at least one other Teleostean larva in which the prim
ordial median fin has exactly the same relations to the anus and
yolk-sac as in the larva just described.                               This second                case     is   that of
the herring.            The existence of               a    pre-anal portion                 of the median
ventral fin in the herring larva was pointed out                                     by    Dr C. Kupffer*
in 1878, but           he includes          it  in his general description, laying no
particular         stress     on     it.f      Balfour, in his Conip. Embryology,
although       he refers to Kupffer's                  work, has overlooked                           this fact in
the structure of the herring                     larva, making               the general statement
that in the young Teleostean                          the ventral           fold of the median fin
ends anteriorily            at the anus.
   It   is   uncertain whether              there are other Teleostean larvae in which
the same state of matters obtains, and                            I         do not know at present
what     relation         the development               of the pelvic fins                        bears         to the
ventral median fold in the two                              cases      mentioned.                  On the two
occasions, when                had the undetermined                         larvae    above described
in the laboratory,      I I     was unable to keep any alive                         for      more          than six
days after hatching.                 At     the end of that time the pre-anal ventral
fin was still unchanged, and no trace of pelvic fins could be                                                      seen,

         and   a   Summary        of the principal       points     apparently

          VIII.  to X.)
     The Committee are of opinion that it is now time to submit                   a
 final Report to the Council.          Nine Annual Reports have already
 been presented, extending altogether to about 400 pages, as printed
 in the Proceedings of the Society.          The appointment      of the Com
 mittee took place in     April 1871, and the first Report was presented
 in April 1872, by which time           a  considerable   number      of answers
 were    received to circulars      sent by the      Committee,     first  to the
 parochial clergy, and next to the parochial schoolmasters, asking for
 information.
     The Committee do not expect that, by continuing inquiries on the
 lines available to them, much additional          information   of importance
  would be obtained.       At all events, it is now desirable to arrange
 the information which has been obtained, in such a way as to make
 it more readily     accessible  — as, for example, to show, in what dis
  tricts the most interesting Boulders        are situated, and also to      indi
  cate  the conclusions    which the positions of the Boulders, or any
  markings on them, suggest.

 766                 Proceedings    of  the  Royal Society
     Before,  however, explaining the means           which the Committee
 have    agreed   to   adopt for classifying      the information       obtained,
the Committee        think it right to record, in        a few sentences,      the
 circumstances which led to the appointment of the Committee.
    The subject of the transportation across the country of masses              of
rock by some natural agency, has from a very early period                    been
discussed in the Royal Society of Edinburgh.             In  the year 1812,   Sir
James Hall, the Society's President,        was the first to break    ground, by-
reading    a valuable    Memoir, afterwards       published in the Society's
 Transactions.      The subject was from time to time again brought
before the Society by different Fellows,— whose names                merely may
bo    mentioned, — viz., Principal James         Forbes,   Professor    Fleming,
 Professor Nicol, Mr James Smith of Jordanhill, Mr Charles Maclaren,
 Mr Robert Chambers, Rev. Thomas Brown, and Mr Milne Home.
 The facts brought forward in this way, of course, were only such as
happened to have been noticed in particular districts by individual
observers.      But  as  it was known that the distribution of Boulders
was universal      over Scotland,     not only on the Mainland, but on
the Islands of the Hebrides,          Orkneys,     and Shetland,     it was felt,
in order to pave the way for         a complete discussion,       that inquiries
of a more comprehensive character were desirable.
    In  the year 1870,    Mr Milne Home received       a communication      from
Professor Favro of Geneva, stating that an inquiry of this character
had, with the co-operation of the Swiss             Geological     Society, been
commenced in Switzerland; that the Geological Society of France had
resolved to follow the example        ;  and he expressed a hope that         Mr
Milne Home, who he heard had taken              some interest    in the Boulder
 question, would endeavour to institute       a similar inquiry for Scotland.
    Mr Milne Home submitted this correspondence to the late Sir
Robert Christison,      and he having       expressed approval of Professor
Favre's suggestions,       Mr Milne Home read        a paper    in the Society,
embracing     his correspondence with the Swiss Professor,              and sug
gesting the appointment        of  a Committee,      with power to make the
requisite inquiries.      Such a committee was shortly thereafter          (April
1871), on the motion of         Sir Robert Christison, appointed by the
Society's Council.
    Altogether   about   1 500 circulars were issued by the Committee ;
answers to a considerable number of which were, in the course of the

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                                  767
following year, received.                    About        one    half of     these answers supplied
information, which                gave materials           for the two first Beports.                    Most
of     these     answers were useful also, by indicating the localities                                     of
remarkable            Boulders,        and thus           enabling          members of the Com
mittee to visit them.
     In    recording      the information                 from time to time obtained,                      the
Committee            could do no more in preparing the Annual Beports than
mention the particular                  county        where           the    Boulder was reported
to be situated.             The consequence                is,   if   any one wishes to discover
what or where               are    the Boulders,            described         as occurring          in any
particular county, he must hunt through                                     the whole nine Annual
Reports to obtain this knowledge.
     In    order to remove this                 inconvenience,               the    Committee            have
framed       a   compendium or abstract of the whole information                                 in      these
Reports,       so as to represent             for    each       county,      in alphabetical order,
what      is   said in them regarding                     Boulders.          This abstract will            be
found in Appendix                 I.
     In    addition      to    a   geographical arrangement of the information
contained         in the Annual Beports,                        it    occurred to some members
of the Committee, that                 it    would be useful to have                  a   Summary           of
the most material facts found in the Beports, and of the inferences
which        these    facts suggest,          in    so far as they seem to throw                         light
on the question, by what agency Boulders                                    could have been trans
ported.          Such   a   Summary has been undertaken                            by the Convener,
and     it     forms Appendix No.-                  II.     This Summary consists almost
entirely of the facts                  set    forth in the             Annual Beports           ,   and     in
Appendix         I.;    but the inferences from                  these      facts involve opinions
in which all persons may not                          agree.           Therefore     the Committee
do not commit themselves either to the adoption or to the rejection
of   these opinions,          though they quite allow that they are valuable as
indicating points worthy of consideration.
   The Committee, whilst aware that their business was                                         to investi
gate      the subject         of Scotch         Boulders,             have not      deemed          it    any
departure from the objects of their appointment                                    to advert to well
authenticated cases of Boulders situated                              in English counties, which
have been on good grounds traced to parent rocks in the south of
Scotland (Abstract, pp. 796, 797, 838, and 852).
  The bearing of this discovery on the direction                                          of     Boulder

768              Proceedings    of the Royal Society
transport, both in England and in Scotland, is very obvious, and
will no doubt    be noticed   in the forthcoming General and Final
Eeport of the British Association Boulder Committee.
    It may here be right to remark,     that the appointment      of the
English Boulder Committee, which took place at the Meeting of
the British Association at Edinburgh in August 1871, was at the
instance  of Professor   Archibald Geikie,   who,  in advocating      the
appointment, remarked on the importance      of exteuding    to England
and Ireland the inquiry, which had already commenced in Scotland.
   The Convener    learns from the Rev.    Mr Crosskey, Chairman of
the English Boulder Committee, that his Committee intend soon to
frame an Abstract of their nine Annual Reports.
   These  Final Reports, embracing the most interesting discoveries
on this subject in England and Scotland       respectively,   may,  it  is
hoped, throw new light on a subject of much geological interest

      Braemar.- — There               is       a    hill       close       to   village    named      " Cairn-a-
 Droche-t," re:u huig an elevation of 2700 feet.                                      Near the top of the hill,
 viz., about 70 yards to the north, lies a block of coarse granite
 12 feet long,       with many other boulders of                                the same    kind.      The rocks
 of the upper part of the      hill consist not of granite, but of quartzow
 gneiss.       Opinion expressed by Mr Janiieson of Ellon, that the large
 block, and many of the others near                                    it,   came from mountains to the
 north, the granite of which                            is    identical with that of the boulders.
 In letter     to Convener,           Mr Janiieson mentions that, near shooting                               lodge
 on this hill, there            is
                                 a    cluster of four or five immense granite boulders
 touching ono another (First Report, 22, and Seventh Report, 41).     p.                                    p.

that divides the shires of Aberdeen and Perth, reaching to                                a height
of       3587 feet.    Mr Jamieson found blocks of                   a peculiar    porphyry on
the northern slope of the hill, near the top ; but no such rock
exists there in situ. The rock of the hill is quartz (Ibid.).
     Chapel Garioch.      — Boulder       19xl5Jxll£ feet, weighing                   about 250

from rocks adjoining.             It   rests  on drift.   Legend, that thrown by
Devil        from Bennachie       Hill,   which is situated to N.W. (First Report,

     Culsalmond.      — Boulder of blue gneiss, 6J feet high x 5£ feet in
girth, known to         archaeologists     as the      " Newton Stone,"*           having on it
Ogham and other very antique inscriptions  (First Report, p. 24).
            —
     Kemnay. Seven large boulders of gneiss, whilst rocks adjoining
are granite.          The largest weighs about 380                      tons.   Most of them
lie on hill-sides facing W. and N. W.                       The gneiss hills of Bennachie
and Cairnwilliam from which                    these    boulders are supposed to have
come, are situated towards             W.N W.          and       N.W., distant     6 or 8 miles.
The valley of Don          is between, these           hills and the boulders.
     On Quarry          Hill,     situated      not        far    from     these   boulders        to
north, rock striations            show movement                  from    west (First          Report,
p. 24, and Second Report, p. 148).
  To the S.E. of the- above boulders, another bluish-grey granite
boulder called " Soutar's Stone," weighing about 270 tons. Height
above sea about 500 feet.                 Lies in muddy sediment,, on                 a   hill-side
facing N.W.           A hill, running N.         and S. for 500 yards, lies to                N.W.,
about a quarter of a mile distant,                     and with ridge about               1   00 feet
above boulder.           If     boulder    came        from       N.W., it must have been
carried across top of this             hill (which is very improbable), or                       else
have come round one end, and have been carried by an eddy into
its present position (Second Report, p. 148).
   Striations on rocks here show movement from                             W.
     New Deer. — Many boulders from                    1    cwt. to several tons in weight
lie in a sort of line for more than a mile south from farm of Green
of Savoch, as far          as.   to the    hill of Coldwells and Toddlehills in
     *
     For speculations regarding the inscriptions, see Tram. Soc. of Scottish
Antiquaries, for years 1862 and 1882. Mentioned in last paper, that another
gneiss boulder of much same size stands near, with figure of a serpent on                           it,
barred with the Z-shaped sceptre symbol.
  Added that Culsalmond parish abounds with relics of paganism.

Campbelton,          the Convener saw and examined a number of boulders
of    a whitish-grey         colour, which the schoolmaster considered to be
granites, adding, that he knew of no rodcs of that nature in Kintyre.
     The Convener found                pebbles       of   same       rock in gravel           pits    at
Campbelton^           and     was there informed            that rock of same                  nature
occurs to the north of Campbelton.                        Professor Nicol of Aberdeen,
when he visited Kintyre, saw                  these boulders, and thought they had
been transported from Arran, where there is rock of the same kind                                         ;

 variety, well            known in the Mourne Mountains in the N.E. of
 Ireland, on account of there being frequently in                         it   crystals of topaz.
 In    the chip from Kintyre, sent to him by Convener, the Professor
 found two topaz crystals.

   hills, but   those in Mull and Ardnamurchan,               distant 30 to 40 miles.
       Boulders are of red and grey granite.              The   sizes  of four or five of
   largest given.      Tho rocks of Cruachan, where                these    boulders lay,

      Longer axis of boulders and rock           striae generally      point   N.W.
       At  heights of 334 feet and less,            rocks appeared to have been
   smoothed from       W.S.W.,      as   if  by glacier from Looh Awe.              Above
    that height, the direction        of the    striae is    N.W. by N., N.N.W.,
    and   W.N.W., the last being most persistent in the highest parts
    of the hill.      Some     of these      Cruachan       boulders     lie on beds of
    gravel, up to a height of 2000 feet         (Fifth Report, p. 48).

p. 26).
    Loch Creran.       — At Fasnacloich, boulders of black granite, two             of
380 and 280 tons respectively.             The boulders have their sharps:
ends pointing towards            mouth    of Loch Creran, viz., to      S.W.     Tt;
rocks in situ are different.
    Chips from       these boulders having been submitted by the Convener
to Professor      J add (Kensington Department),            he identified   then:   *s
similar in composition to rocks seen by him in Skye,               Mull, and ArJ-
namurchan.          It  appeared to him that the Appiii           boulders, before
mentioned, were the same in. composition            as. the. Fasnacloich boulders.
    Professor      Judd stated, that         these   Loch     Creran    and   Appir
boulders are        not granites, but " rocks of         a  basic composition, — a
gabbro with some black mica" (Fourth Report, p. 11).
    At mouth of, loch, rocks smoothed (when facing W.X.W.) ap
to about TO feet above sea.                  About a mile higher up loch,
smoothed rocks face "W;S.W:           at height of 80 foet above sea.
    Near     sea level smoothing     seemed due to some force moving down
valley.       Rocks at a higher level, seemed         to. have been smoothed       by
force moving, from N;W.
    In Glon       Creran most of boulders lie on drift.              At one    plice
boulders form a cluster on a rocky knoll.

     Lendalfoot. — A little to north, an Old Red Sandstone                      Con
 glomerate   boulder   8x6x6       feet.    It  is (indistinguishable    from     the
 Conglomerate rock of Wemyss Bay, situated about 30 miles                     to the
 north (Sixth Report, p. 33).
     Beith. — On Cuffs Hill, consisting of porphyry, there are on                  its
 north side many small granite blocks which must have come                     from
 the west or N."\V.
     (1) Mr Robert Craig of Boith, in several papers read before the
 Geological Society of Glasgow (Tram., voL iv. parts 1 and 2), divides
 the boulders in the north of Aryshire into two classes.          One    class con
 sists of rocks foreign to the district, viz.,     Old Red Sandstone,      granite,
 quartz, gneiss, mica of chlorite, schists, and clay slate.             These      he
 thinks   were transported from mountains            in the N.W.,   distant from
 50 to 70 miles, by    drift  ice and marine agency.         The other     class he
 derives from rocks situated to the           N.I* and at no great       distance,
 transported by laud ice.
     (2) Messrs Crosskey and Robertson also sent to the Glasgow
 Geological Society (Trans., vol. iv. part 1) an account of boulders of
 great size, and in large numbers, found in excavating new docks at
 Greenock.     The great majority of the larger boulders are          sandstones
 of the neighbourhood     ; — the remainder are of quartz, mica schist,         ic,
 from the Argyllshire mountains to the N.W,
     (3) Mr Robertson, in the Glasgow Geological Society's Tratuac-
 tions, 19th Jan. 1877, gives an account of large boulders, covered
 with Balani and Serpidm,        in  a bed   of sandy mud 18 feet      deep, con
 taining also nodules of flint.
     The conclusions he drew from the boulder being covered                    with
 marine zoophytes was, that after being so covered, they                had    been
 lifted up by shore ice and transported to their present position.

     On these        hills, up     to 587      feet above           the sea, there are              many
boulders, — mostly of grey granite, and                        a   few of Conglomerate.
     Between those hills and Goatfell                          there   is   a deep valley, well
strewed         with granite blocks.          Most of them             are rounded.         On west

regretted         not     being    able to examine them.                        They     were       most
numerous on          hill   slopes facing      N.W.
     The absence of boulders in Brodick Bay, whilst they                                     abound
along the shore to the north and south, invites special                                explanation.
If   a     glacier descended       from Goatfell,               boulders should           have      been
numerous in the bay and. valley leading up from                              it   to Goatfell.        If
the boulders came              on floating ice from                 the N. or          N.N.E        they
would be dropped along the east shone, and on the                               bill   slopes   facing
the north.         But they would        be deflected from Brodick Bay, by                      a   high

     Bute Island. — East coast, north of Rothesay, examined, and a list

 on Old Red Sandstone and clay slate rocks, — and must have
 come from the hills         to the north (Seventh     Report, p. 14).
     Along     west coast,       north   of Ettrick   Bay, there are     numerous
 boulders,     also of schists, which show by their positions that they also
 came from north.            Several of these boulders are standing         on end
 leaning against rocks on their              east sides  (Seventh Report,    p.  16)

  gorge of     a  powerful      current of     some  kind, hurrying through it
  from a northerly point, stones            and rubbish.     A  diagram given of
  some of the stria?, showing that they have been incised more deeply
  at north ends than            elsewhere, in     consequence probably      of the

that a bed        of   "drift,"    40 feet    thick is    there,   the lower     half of
which consists       of unstratified sandy mud,            containing broken       sheik

more    or less rubbed and scratched.               Ho found in it fragments of
shells.
     Wick. — Three boulders,        each weighing from 20 to 30 tons.             One is
a  Conglomerate, supposed to have come from hills 20 miles to south.
But Rev.       Mr Joass      states that Conglomerate rock occurs              to west
ward at less distance.
     Wick Bay. — -Mr Jamieson           found here      a   similar bed of boulder
clay, containing fragments of shells and numerous large water-worn
boulders of sandstone,           quartzose,   mica slate, and granite, on which
glacial scorings are well marked.              One granite boulder was 12 feet
in length (First Report, p. 30, and Proceedings of London Geological
Society, 7th February 1866, p. 265).
    In   the    same     paper,     Mr Jamieson         states   that    in   Caithness
generally,     the shells,      as a   rule, in the clay beds           and drift, are
broken.      But exceptions occur.           He himself found one entire valve
of Astarte Borealis ; and he saw several entire specimens in local
collections.
   He adds, that one of the objects he "had                    particularly    in view
was    to  note    the   direction of the glacial markings on the rocks,
and to ascertain      whether they conld be accounted                 for by a move
ment of ice proceeding from the interior of the country towards the
coast.    I   therefore     lost no opportunity        of noting the bearings         of

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                           795
scratches         whenever     I saw   them."      Mr Jaruieson then gives the
"bearings at twenty localities in Caithness, from which he concludes
that      the movement had heen from           N.W. to S.E.; and        he adds, that
"    a movement of ice from           N.W. to S.E.      across Caithness is     totally
at     variance with the notion of the scratches having been caused by
glacier action proceeding from the interior of the country towards
 the present coast." In a footnote, Mr Jamieson adds, that " the
 presence of marine organisms (in the Caithness drift), and the
 direction of the glacial stria3, which indicate a movement from the
 N.W.,        where   there   is now   nothing    but   open  sea   for an immense
 distance, together with the           absence    of moraines, are all suggestive
 of     marine conditions having prevailed during              the deposition    of the
  Caithness drift."
      In   year 1828, the late     Sir Eoderick Murchison published            a paper
  in     Proceedings of London Geological Society,               in which he men
  tions that " the highest hills in the Brora district afford, upon their
  sides and summits, distinct traces of a strong diluvial current, which
   has swept them        free  of covering matter, and deposited in the plain
   of Clyne, Milltown, a mass composed of the debris of the denuded
   hills. A large portion of the turf having been recently removed,
   the surface of the rock was           seen  to be scored      with parallel lines.
   The direction of the markings is uniformly from N.N.W. to S.S.E."

   Mr "William Jolly, Inspector of Schools, Inverness, sent                   to the
Committee valuable notes regarding               the distribution and    parentage
of    Morayshire       boulders,    which    are    given   in Fifth    and Suih
Reports.
   He    says — " There would       seem to be two varieties     of Conglomerate
                                           '                      "
boulders distributed through the             Loigh of Moray.'          One variety
is  a Conglomerate,         containing   "a    dark purplish    or liver-coloured
quartzite, in pieces of considerable           size."    Great rocks of it     occur
on both banks of Loch Ness, and especially in the hill situated                   on
the north bank called Mealfourvonie,              reaching to a height of      3060
feet.     This rock breaks into cubical-shaped mosses, and                probably
has produced the remarkable boulders in the counties                     of Jfairn,
 Moray, and Banff, known as
                                         " Culloden or Cumberland Stone,

same counties,   " consists of more angular components, and is entirely
without the liver-coloured quartzite or porphyry ;" Mr Jolly says
that examples of it may be seen embedded in boulder clay at Links-
field, near Elgin, and on the crest of the hill of Eoseisle.
    Mr Jolly adds that the boulders of this last-named variety of
Conglomerate              seem    to have been transported              at an earlier period
than     those   of the liver-coloured          variety, being generally embedded
in     boulder      clay or drift, whilst the boulders of the liver-coloured
variety lie more on the surface of the country.                                It   is some cor
roboration of this view, that there                 are     two sets of striae on the
rocks, viz., from           6° S. of West, and       15°         N. of West.          The Con

    The nearest rocks of    same composition     as boulder, are in Garhoc
 Hill, about 6 miles distant, and bearing W. by N. (by compass).
    H agent which smoothed and striated the sides of the boulder
 came, as is probable, from the westward, it seems, when it reached
 the boulder at  A C (its west end),  to have divided into two streams, —

south side S.S.E.
    The clay in which the boulder       was buried,   contained blocks    and
pebbles, some of them, soft (such as shale, coal, &c, from the west),
and others, hard (rock or greenstone, granite, &c), quite capable of
smoothing and striating the boulder,       if driven and squeezed     against
it by   some agent  of sufficient weight and magnitude.
    (2) In the village of Linton, several portions of porphyria

    On another portion, the surface of which             slopes  down towards
north     at an angle    of about    35°,   the direction   of the   striae is due

    Each set of striae might bo produced by the same agent. If its
normal direction was W.N.W., it would, on striking the rock
¦which slopes down north, be deflected into an E. and W.
direction.
    (3) A still more remarkable case of the same kind occurs in
a    cutting of the North British Railway, about half a mile to
the west of Linton station.          The rock is on the south side of the
line. The smoothed surface            is about 18 feet high and 25 feet in

 of from N. 11° W. to N. 20° W. The striae run across the
 rocky surface in a direction        E.    15°  N. — the deflection from the
 normal direction of the striating         agent being greater here than at
 Linton village, on account of the larger area of the opposing surface.
    It may be added that, whilst in the lower part of the rocky sur
 face, the striae are horizontal,    near the top of the rock they rise up
  towards   the east at an angle of 4° or 5°.            If the striating agent
  consisted of a mass    of drift, the pebbles and blocks in the lower
  part would    move horizontally,     and produce horizontal       striae.   But

exposed rock, the east side being covered by gravel, clay, and stones.
     On      a steeply     inclined part of the hill, there is                         a surface         of    the

of   some       dense      but yielding body, which could be moulded to                                        the

" As viewed from                   a       little distance, the scorings                 appear          to be

be reached,           I   found, on using              the clinometer, that this is by no
means         the case.          On        one patch       of rock     I found         two     striae    within
18 inches        of   each other, the upper of                   which had       a   dip of     4°, and the
lower a dip of 20°, and both markings                                 were       dipping towards               th*

  Mr Stevenson adds, that " the rock surface discovered by him had
been entirely concealed by debris, till it was removed, to allow
of the rock being                  quarried.          A     similar       mass       of debris extendi

  (2) The Convener of the Committee, thinking that North Berwick
Law deserved a farther examination, proceeded to     and gave the                       it,
results of his examination in a paper read before the Royal Sooetj

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1883-8-4.                        805
    He found     that the rock       surface described by    Mr Stevenson is
situated on the N.W. side of the Law, and that the smoothed part
slopes down towards the N. and N.W., at an angle of from 65° to
70°.
    Farts of the smoothed surface face N.W., other parts face due
north, and some N. by E.; but wherever the rock faced a more
easterly direction,    there was no smoothing.
    The only parts of the smoothed rock surface striated were those
fronting N.W. by N., or          a few degrees on either side of that point.
    Their direction is W. by S., or W.S.W.; and most of them                 arc
 apparently horizontal.
    Some of the ruts and striae, especially at their west ends,              are
 deeply incised in the rock, showing the extreme and continuous
 pressure which predominated there.
    The particular direction in which the striating agent moved, may
 be inferred, by considering,        that if it came  in a direction   parallel
  with  the rock   surface,   it might grind or smooth, but would hardly
  produce ruts or strise    ;   nor would it have this      effect, if it  came
  against the rock surface at right angles.         A line parallel with     the
  rock surface,  would be S.W., and a line at right angles would be
  about  N.N.W.      The intermediate point would be W.N.W.            ;— from
  which   direction   therefore, (the Convener       inferred)    the striating
  agent moved on and against         North Berwick Law.

                                — Shores     on west side of island thickly strewn
with        boulders, many resembling yellow Mull granite.
      A    large boulder on west shore, called
                                                       " Fingal's Pvtting Stone."
      At     Kiloran, on N.W. part of island, there           are many boulders.
      On several ridges sloping down towards west boulders occur,
 some above         a ton  in weight    {Seventh Report, p. 21).
      On west coast there are some granite blocks of                   a yellowish-red
 colour, different from any rocks seen in Colonsay.
      In     Oronsay Island there are blocks           of syenite, which probably
 may have           come    from Kiloran      Bay in Colonsay, distant         9 miles
  N.N.W.,        also grey granite which may have come from Colonsay.
      There      are fragments of red granite        with large crystals;     —but   no
  rocks of that variety, known in Oronsay or Colonsay.
       On    east side of Oronsay, boulder of coarse-grained granite,         pinky in
  colour, which is supposed to have come from east coast of Colonsay,
  There are boulders of quartzite, and nodules of chocolate red sand

   Colonsay or Oronsay (Ninth Report, p. 17).
       3. Mull. — On road to Torloisk from Tobermory, Professor Duns
   found       numerous      granite   boulders  — for     most     part  the  reddish
   variety — others      are grey.    The largest boulder        seen was gneiss.     A
   small quartzite boulder was also seen.             All   of them are rounded and
   smooth.        Four boulders lie     en trainee, the    line being N. and S.
       In    approaching      west coast of North Mull, boulders decrease            in

 feet,   weighing   about   190 tons.       Longer    axis   N.TV.       There     *r?
 many boulders on E.S.E. side of island, opposite to Ross                  of Mai
 which have led some persons to suggest           that these     may have        beea
transported across      the narrow arm of the sea which             divides Jfnfl
from lona.      But the Duke of Argyll is quoted           as  thinking that      th*
lona granite boulders are a different variety (First Report, p. 27).
    In Eoss of Mull two varieties of granite (red and grey) extensively
 quarried (Second Report, p. 157).
    About half a mile north of the large boulder above specified,              there
is another large red granite boulder about 12 feet square.                East   en J
rests   on clay slate rocks of lona.          There is a groove (which was
seen    by Convener)      on under     surface of boulder, running X              L
indicating that    it had  been pushed     in or from that direction (Srw»»

    To    N.E   of Cathedral,    along    the shore,     hundreds       of  grscit^
boulders (chiefly the red variety)      ; — several  exceeding 20 tons.
    The rocks of lona are chiefly clay slate.         Convener     saw no    otker,
and he was told there are no granite rocks.
    At the south end of the island, many granite boulders                  (moetlr
red,   but some also of grey variety)      lying on high ground          from 300
to 300 feet above sea.        One of these seen by Convener, standing
upon end, leaning against      a rock on its S.W. side, as        if it  had come
from    a N.E. direction (Lithograph No.         15, Plate   VIII.).
    Most of the boulders in south end of lona lie with longer                  axi»
N.E. and E.N.E.
    Convener heard of a large boulder on west side of island in                 t*&
fragments, which to his informant had suggested                 the idea of     the
boulder having been broken by falling from           a height (Second BepA
p. 155).
   The highest hill on island is called " Dun            I."    On the N.S.W.
side of this   hill there is a plateau at height of 230 feet above
On the plateau, where it joins the hill, there is           a large red granite
boulder,    weighing    about   400 tons,      cubical   in   shape,    and   verr

angular, 22 x 16 x 16 feet, its base resting on the plateau, and its
top leaning against side of hill (Lithograph No. 16, Plate IX.).
      On ascending to summit of hill (which reaches to height of 400
feet above sea) Convener found several boulders of red granite.
      Mr Allan M'Donald (schoolmaster) doubts the theory that the
 red granite boulders on " Dun I Hill came from the Ross of Mull ;
                                            "
 — first,    because the rocks at Ross of         Mull do not    reach to so   high a
 level as 400 feet ; second, because, as regards the 400 ton boulder,
  " Dun I " Hill is situated between it and the Ross of Mull, so that
 transportation from Ross is hardly conceivable. Ross of Mull bears
  from boulder S.S.E.
       The smooth     faces   of the rocks in Iona, front N. by E., the rough
  faces front south {Second Report, p. 156).
       In a subsequent year (1878) the Convener again visited Iona, and
  went to look at the large boulder on " Dun L" He then observed
   that the boulder was composed of coarse-grained red granite —more
   coarso than the boulders on east side of island previously referred
   to.    The prevailing rocks of Iona         are a fine-grained gneiss, approach
   ing in many places to clay        slate.
       The boulder on      "Dun I" Hill       seemed to indicate that    it had been
    brought by some agent from         a north-westerly point, which agent had
    stranded on the hill, and stuck there,           till boulder dropped from it.
        Captain Stewart of Coll was with Convener when latter examined
    the boulder.      On examining the portions broken           off, as also another
    small boulder lying below, exactly similar in composition, Captain
    Stewart at once exclaimed        — " This     is Coll granite."
        In reference   to this suggestion,     it is   to some extent confirmed    by
    the fact, that the island of Coll bears about           N.N.W. from Iona, and
    is distant about 20 miles.        But the Convener, having visited Coll a
    few days afterwards, did not fall in with any granite rocks there.
     They  were   all gneiss,   with only occasional veins of granite. But he
     did find granite boulders in Coll, somewhat similar in composition
     to the large boulder on
                                  " Dun   I"    (Fifth Report, p. 4).
        A well rounded boulder of Conglomerate was found by Convener
     on east coast of Iona        Heard that similar blocks occur on west shore
     in St Columba's Bay.          There are no Conglomerate rocks in Iona.
     The nearest spot is said to be Inch Kenneth Island (on west of Mull),
     where, according to Macculloch, it forms cliffs about 100 feet high

810                               Proceedings         of   the   Eoyal Society
(Western Islands, vol. i. p. 515). Inch Kenneth is about 10
X.E. from Iona (Second Report, p. 155).
      Staffa was visited by Convener. He found on
      5.                                            at his first risi,                     it,
several small boulders of red granite. There are no rocks of graniJe
on the island.              It    consists entirely of blue trap (Second                         Report,     p.      157).
      In    a   small bay on east side                     of island, the Convener (on his
second   visit) found several                         small boulders of red granite, gneia,
quartzite, and limestone, none of which occur in Staffa as rocks.
      About      20 yards from this bay, Convener                             found an old sea-beach
36 feet above               high water mark, from the gradual breaking                                           up       of
which the foregoing boulders are probably derived.
  Quotation given from Dr Macculloch to show how perplexed he
was to account for the occurrence on Staffa of " transported stones,''
which, he assumes, must have been carried by natural agency from
some of the neighbouring islands         (Fifth Report, p. 11).
      C.   Tiree. — (1) Haynish Hill, in S.W. end of island, reaches to 600
feet       above sea.     It consists of gneiss, in some parts passing
into granite.
      The hill on its west side coincides with sea-cliffs, and has on                                                 it
a   number of rocky knolls.                       Almost every knoll                has on its N.W. side
(i.e.,facing the Atlantic) boulders more                                    or      less     rounded.            The
following are particulars of some —                        :
      Boulder        11 x    8    x   5   feet resting on side of         knoll facing W.N.W

height of 360 feet above sea, which                              is   a   quarter of         a    mile distant,
with access              from the          sea   between         S.   and     N.N.W.             points.        This
boulder         is   a   coarse granite, — the             knoll   is     gneiss.
      Boulder        8x7x5            feet resting on side of              knoll facing N.W.                    by   X.

    Two clusters of largo boulders met with, the uppermost                                                 on the
cluster so posed                 as to    show   it   must have come from westward.                              The
sea    is   within half           a   mile to westward.
      On this            Haynish          Hill   boulders        more        numerous on              sides          or
slopes facing             "VV.    and     N.W. than on any                 other.          On slopes        facing
E. and S.E.              there are also boulders, but fewer                      in   number.
  (2) Passing due north, along Big Cornish Road, Convener found
on east side of road several rocky knolls, tops of which are from 80                                                 to

110 feet above           sea.      Most of     these   knolls present tare rock on west
sides, and have houlders on those sides.                           On one of the knolls a
boulder         10 x 6 x 6 feet, very near its top — a                 light coloured     gneiss.
Rock of knoll also              gneiss, but dark coloured.
   Another rocky knoll, about a mile to N.E. of last, has on it a
number of large boulders called " The Giant's Pebbles," in reference
to a legend that they were thrown by giants from Barra, an
island N.W. of Tiree, and distant about 40 mDes.       There are here
from twenty to thirty boulders of all sizes, almost all on the knoll,
and none on the adjoining flat land.    Suggestion offered, that knoll
had intercepted the raft which carried the boulders.
  (3) Ben Gott Hill forms a rocky ridge running N. and S. about
120 to 130 feet above sea. A very large number of boulders chiefly
on its N.W. flanks.                  Some are on S.E. flanks, possibly           pushed over
ridge. On flat ground S.E. of ridge, boulders are few in number.

   7.    Coll. — Visited Bein Hoch;               hill on west side of island, reaching
to 290 feet above          sea.       There are   two boulders at top : — one near the
summit which              slopes      down     towards        N.W., the other on           a    flat
which forms summit of hill {Lithograph No. 17, Plate IX.).
  Near foot of hill, on its N.W. side, there is a rocky plateau
abutting against          it,
                  at height of 80 feet above sea.
                                     a                On this low
hill    there   is  a   large boulder 16 x 20          x   13 feet (308 tons).
   All      these     boulders are       a    coarse   granite, passing sometimes into
dark coloured           gneiss.       Eock of hill      is   gneiss.
  The       sea (viz.,    Atlantic)      is   towards west and north, distant about
half    a   mile.
  There         can   hardly      be no doubt,         that    these   boulders were brought
here across the sea.

     (4)  At S.W. end of island, there        are many large granite bonlders
 near    Coll House.       Convener measured one and found           it 35  x 15 x8
 feet (312 tons).      It was on its   S.E. end, leaning on or pressing       agtiaK
 a gneiss rock.         The granite boulder        is of a coarse      variety,    the
 fragments composing          it being of large  size.    This was probably        the
 boulder     which Captain         Stewart   was thinking of, when he             com
 pared the large      Iona boulder to Coll granite.
      (5) Macculloch, in his account of the Geology of ColL refers to i
  " block of             "
                            which he found at a great distance from the
                augite
 shore, and which he thought must " be a transported bUtrk" as h* W
  seen no rock     of that kind in the island.        He says that it      probahlj
  came from     Rum Island, where that rock abounds.              Rum is     situated
  N. by E. from Coll, and distant about           20 miles.
      Convener omitted to inquire for this augite block.
      8.  Eigg. — Mr M'Pherson,        proprietor of the island, drew out           for
  the Committee some valuable notes.
       One large boulder rests on the Scoor ridge, — a remarkable rids
  of pitcliBtone porphyry           which runs for about       2 miles   •cross the
  island in an east and west direction.           It  reaches,   at its east  end. to
   a  height of 1300 feet above the sea — at its west end, to               a height
  of 900 to 990      feet.   It  rises from a plateau    which is about      400 fret
   above sea.
       Both north and south sides of the Scoor            are precipitous, almort
   vertical, showing a cliff on the north side of 270 feet, on             the sonth
   side of 400 feet.
       The boulder on this ridge is near its western extremity,                and oo
   a part of the ridge      which is lower than any other part, viz., $90
   above   sea.  It is close to top of ridge, and on the slope facing the north
       This boulder       is said to be of granite        or gneiss — a rock
   existing in the island.

    Many other boulders of the       same   kind   are strewed over the island.
    On N.E. part of island there is a granite boulder of a larger size
than any other, and is of a darker colour.               It is on the side of a
hill  sloping down towards S.W., at about 300 feet above              sea.     Hill
itself is about 900 feet above        sea.    Mr M'Pherson      says that he has
seen on the      shores of Loch         Alsh,   to   the east    of Skye, rocks
resembling this boulder.
    Chips of   these   Eigg boulders       were   procured.     They   were sub
mitted    to Professor    Geikie.      Among the chips         he detected one
which    appeared   to him to have come from the Torridon group of
 Old Red Sandstone, viz., the         coast   of the mainland      to the north
east of Skye.
    Professor Geikie, in his account of the Geology of Eigg, adverts to
 the finding of   " pieces   of Eed Sandstone of Cambrian derivation,"
 which (he says) make it clear that the higher grounds from which
 they were borne could not have lain to the S. or E. but to the N.W.
 or N." (Land.    Geol. Soc.    Proc, vol. xxvii.      p. 309)   (Ninth    Report,
p. 22).
    9. Carina. — Convener told by an experienced contractor for build
 ing that he had found on the islet of Sanda (forming the south
 side of Canna harbour) blocks of a red sandstone, which he made
 use   of for the lintels and corners of            a  new schoolhouse.        The
largest was   6x4x2       feet.    These sandstones differ from the rock of
the island, which is a blue slaty schist, ill-adapted for building.             He
knew that      these   sandstone rocks abound           in Eum Island,       as he
had quarried them       there.
    Macculloch    noticed these red sandstone blocks on Canna, which he
 says differ from Canna rocks ; and he states that similar             sandstone
 rocks occur in Eum and Skye (Western Highlands, vol. i. p. 467).
    10. Barra. — A very large boulder of coarse gneiss approaching to
 granite exists here near the base of Ben Erival, on its side sloping
 down to north.       The hill   reaches   to about 600 feet above sea-level.
 Height of boulder      28 or 26 feet,     its extreme length 37 to 38 feet,
 and its width about        18 feet ;   assuming    2  tons for one cubic yard,
 ite approximate     weight would be 890 tons             (Fifth Report,    p.  12)
 (Lithograph No.      20,  Plate IX.).
    Convener prevailed on tenant of the          hill  to dig under the boulder
 to discover the nature of the materials forming its site.            An account

  814                       Proceedings              of   th-c    Royal Society
 is given on            p. 67   of the Report, from which                       it      appears       that "-
 materials were gravel and earth, with sea shells.                                      The      boulde:
 evidently not lying on rock.
      The supposition of the Convener was, that when brought                                                to is
 present site it fell on what was then sea-bottom.                                       The       site of        "Js
 boulder is now 230 feet above                       sea.
      A plan        is given     in      the     Report,          to assist    consideration               of tk
 question, from            what direction the boulder probably came                                         to     it;
 present     site   ;— the result of the Convener's consideration                                  being thii
 it   must have come oither from the                             N.W. or      the    N.E.,       there      being
 open sea only in these two directions.
      About      100      yards to           the west of             the   " Big Boulder"                    there
 is   a    rocky         isolated     knoll,             about       255    feet        above        the         sea,
 clustered with boulders.                    These are lying partly on rock, pirtlron
 shelly gravel, and chiefly on the                           N.W.     side of the           knoll.         On     3
 study of the positions of the boulders on this knoll,     appeared                       it                      to
 Convener that the uppermost boulders to get into their positions must
 have come from N.W. point.
    About 200 yards N.R of " Big Boulder" there                                             is   a   boulder
 lying on smoothed rock surface, which dips due north
             a                                                                                 on an     angle
 of 20°.      This boulder          is   5   x   4   x   2   feet.    It could      not    have obtained
 and retained its position unless by having                                been      brought       from the
 north.
      About 300 yards            to   S.E. of             "Big Boulder"             there   is   a   boulder
 8x6x3        feet, at height of 228 feet above sea.                            The       boulder      at    its
 east end     presses       closely on rock which has prevented                                it    moving
 further in an easterly direction (Lithograph No. 21, Plate IX.).
    On N.W. of Ben Erival, where its sides slope down steeply                                         to    the
sea, there    are numerous boulders, many of which                                                          the

   Ben More          is   a   hill on Eoligarry Farm.                      Its west         end forms       a
steepish    sea-cliff rising to           a      height of 330 feet above                   sea.     Half

  from   N.W., and the boulder is blocked at its S.K end by a rocky
  portion of the hill (as shown by Lithograph No. 22, Plate IX.).
     At   Castle Bay (at south end of Barra) the hills are covered with
 boulders, but more on their N.W. slopes than on any other.
     Mr Campbell (Paper              " Glacial Phenomena
                                oh                                of Hebrides")     states
 that he took rubbings          of striae at Castle Bay, which              showed that
 striating agent had moved from N. by W. (magnetic).
     He mentions that on the small island of Bernera, about                      12 miles
south of Barra, he got        striae at a height      of 720 feet above        sea, cross
 ing the strike of the rocks from N.N.W.
     On hill called Scurrival, whose west side rises abruptly from                      sea
 to height of 240 feet, the hard gneiss rocks show proofs of a grinding
action on them from N.W.                   The strata are horizontal,          and form
blocks with their longer axis lying about N. and                  S.     The west sides
of   these blocks facing sea present frequent smoothings,                   especially at
their north     ends, whilst the south        ends remain rough, showing action
on the blocks from        N.W.
     On this hill the boulders          are numerous, and many              of them    are
blocked     at their  S.E.   ends.      They    are from    200 to 300 yards from
the    sea, and about     100 or 150 feet above sea-leveL                The situations
and positions of        these   boulders combine to show that they must
have come here from a north-westerly                direction.
     On the summit of the hill, which consists of well rounded and
smoothed surfaces of gneiss, numerous boulders lie scattered, most
of them on that part of the top which               faces  W.N.W.
     11. South Vist.   —  Near   south    end,  there  is Carshavaule      Hill,ori west
side of which is Loch Dunkellie.                 On   east bank      of loch,    a gneiss
rock well striated, — the          striae   running N.W. by N.               At   a little
distance     to S.E., on south of Carshavaule               Hill,  a    valley through
which current might have passed, after striating the rock.
    Loch Boisdale. — On east coast.               Kennet Hill, situated on north
side    of loch, presents numerous examples on its west flanks                           of
smoothed       surfaces and       of large boulders,         many of them           abut
ting on rocks at their          east ends (see Diagrams             in Fifth Report,
p.    17).    One    of   these    boulders      is   19x13x8          feet,   146   tons
(Lithograph No. 23, Plate IX.).
    At junction of roads from Barra and Loch Boisdale, where Roman
Catholic and Free Churches                are   situated,   there     is a cluster       of

810                   Proceedings of the Royal Society
boulders.     One     16x6x5       feet, leaning    on the others, must        have
come from     N.W. to attain its position.
    On hill to     east  of Askernish,      and on Mingary        Hill,   there ire
many large boulders,        chiefly on west flanks, as also striated roekj,
well deserving of study (Litliograph No. 24, Plate              IX.).
    About   3 miles to    north of Askernish there is         a  block of granite
perched on the pointed          summit      of  a  rocky hill.     The boulder »
14 x   12x8 feet (about 100 tons) (Lithograph No. 25, Plate TLX
There is no way in which it could have attained its position except
by floating    ice.
    At Jocdar,     1
                     J miles south of ferry between TJist and Benbeeah,
there are smoothed rocks           " UteixUly   covered by parallel     stris, rata,
and grooves," the direction of which is          N.W. by W.        The   smoothed
surface   of the rocks here slopes down           to westward, at an angle of
about 10° or 12°.         Some of the ruts are 4 or 5 feet long.             One at
its N.W.     end measures       8 inches     across   and 2 inches in depth          ;
 another 12 inches across and 1| inch deep.              Towards the S.K. they
 lessen in width and depth.              There can be no doubt that the
 striating agent here came from           N.W.     The height of this place is
 about 25 feet     above the sea — the Atlantic — and        J  of a mile distant.
    There is a similar good example of striated rocks about half a mile
 to the west of the above mentioned ferry (Lithograph No. 26, Plate X.).
     On road between Grogary (mansion-house of Lady Gordoa
  Cathcart) and Loch Skiport (on east coast) there are many strikint:
  examples of striated rocks and boulders.
     Loch   Eport is     a remarkably      narrow area of the sea on the eas
  coast,  which     runs  more   than half-way      across  North    ULsi.     From
  deck of steamboat Convener            saw,   on both sides of Loch, maay
  boulders, resting chiefly on rocky knolls, and many rocks with                faces
  smoothed on west sides.
     North Uist. — Loch Maddy,          a  sea-loch on east coast        An hov't
  walk for about      a mile  from the shore, showed Convener that nxk*
  here have their smoothest sides facing          N.W. (Fifth Report, p. 2iJ.
     Professor Heddle, in     a  subsequent year, visited Loch Maddy, tad
  reported that rocks there generally showed               smoothings       by
  agent passing over them from the westward.
     He refers also to two islets of trap rock called Maddy More «r-
  Maddy Beg, which are (as he says) " porpoise-nosed to the ntft, ***

 cliffs to the east" as indicating probably the direction of the agent
 which flowed over them.
     Professor     Heddle    on this      occasion,   at Loch Maddy,           met     a
gentleman, a member of the Glasgow Geological                     Society, who had
just returned from Newton on the                   coast   of North        Uist.    He
described to the Professor         a   boulder he had seen there,           13x5x4
feet, and another        9x5x5       feet.    The   former     lay with its longer
axis N.N.W.           He stated also that the rocks on the west shore were
generally glaciated, and from points between              N.W. and S.W. {Sixth
Report,     p. 34).
     On Canneum,         a rocky    islet north    of Loch Maddy, there             are
two boulders of Laurentian gneiss, weighing,               the one about 15, the
other about       50,  tons.   From the corresponding             slopes   of the two
ends which        face  each  other,   it has    been   inferred     that they were
originally     one boulder, though       now about      1 00   feet   apart from one
another,      and with a projecting         rocky  knoll between them.             The
 reporter,    Alex. Carmichael,       suggested that the boulder may have
fallen from      a  height on this rock, and been broken              into two frag
 ments     (First Report, p. 35).
      Harris. — (1) At Rodil (south end of Harris), rocks on Stron-
 davelhill smooth on west        faces, rough on east faces.
     (2)  At   Borve, on west coast, a remarkable assemblage of boulders
 on hill about 800tfeet high, sloping down to W. by N., close to shore
 of the Atlantic (Lithograph No. 27, Plate IX.). The boulders lie on
 and against benches of gneiss rocks, these rocks also being smoothed
 and ground down from westward.                  These boulders lie in such a
 way    as to show they have come from westward             (Fifth Report,     p. 23).
     (3) Similar appearances in Loch Castle Bay and Valley.
     (4) About 1 1 mile south of Tarbert, several large boulders, which
 probably reached their positions by coming through                        depressions
 existing in the range of hills to N.W.
     (5) On hills north of Tarbert, up to height of 800 feet above sea-
 level, Convener saw many evidences of a N.W. current loaded with
 ice, which has brought          boulders and smoothed the rocks                 (Fifth
 Report, p. 26, plate viii. fig. 28).
     Professor Heddle separately visited Tarbert, and specifies certain
 homblendic         boulders,  which he traced to            a   rock    identical    in
 character a few hundred yards to westward (Sixth Report, p. 35).

    (8)  Shin nt Islands. — On western shores       Professor      Heddle        found
several blocks of rocks foreign to the islands, and occurring                  in dtu
in   the  Long Island to the west.        Some Conglomerate boulders                 he
considered    had come from Stornoway, 30 miles to north, the                  nearest
place for Conglomerate rocks       (Sixth Report,     p. 36).
    Boulders of trap on eastern shores of the islands supposed                to hare
been pushed from rocks on west side of the islands (Transactions                     oj
Norfolk and Norwich Naturalists'         Society, vol.    iii, 27th Jan.       1S80).
    12.  Lewis. — Professor Heddle examined             the    district    between
Tarbert in Harris and Stornoway on foot,         a distance of 28       miles.     Be
was struck with the general flatness       of the district, especially in          its
northern part, considering that the rocks there come generally                 to the
surface, and are on edge.     They suggested the idea of some         great abrad
ing agent which had passed over the district (Eighth Report,                 p. 29).
    (1) Xear Ardvourlie, on Loch Seaforth, a trainee of
                                                                          boulders,
forming a line E. by X. and W. by S., apparently traceable to gap
in chain of hills    to S.W.
    Clusters of boulders seen there, so piled on one another            as to show
that the topmost had come from westward.
    (2)  At and near Soval, 12 miles south of Stornoway, rocks forming
cliffs, smooth on sides facing west, rough on sides facing             east.
    On one of these cliffs facing the west there is a boulder               on edge
of rocky cliff, which there forms         a surface    sloping down        towards
W.X.W.      at an angle of from      20° to 30°.      Longer axis of        boulder
W.X.W.         Seemed    to Convener    clearly to have come          from     west
ward (Sketch in     Fifth Report,   plate viii. fig. 29).
    (3)  Loclis Own and Shiel, on east coast.          Boulders     seen by Con

     (5) Afiavig, an arm of sea branching up from Loch Roag on west
coast.          On top of a hill called Dramainan Voltas, 270 feet above
sea, there is an immense assemblage of boulders, chiefly on north
and west slopes (Lithograph No. 29, Plate X.) [Fifth Report, p. 29).
      (6) Garry- na-hine to Carlowrie. Rocks along and near road, show
smooth faces towards west. At low levels they vary in their aspects,
as W.; — W. by S.; — and even W.S.W.                      But at higher levels, viz.,
 above 300           feet,   the smoothed faces are pretty uniformly          towards
 W.N.W. (Fifth              Report,   p. 30).
      The explanation of this seemed to be that the rocks at high levels
 were exposed to a normal current from N. W., whilst rocks at low
 levels were exposed to diverging and eddying currents.
       Convener examined particularly striated rocks described by Dr
  James Geikie (Land. Geul. Journal for 1873, p. 537), who expressed
  an opinion that the stria; had been formed by a glacier which moved
   across the slope of the rocks from the S.K.                   The Convener, after
  twice examining            these rocks, was of opinion that the stria; had been
   formed        b^ some agent passing from the N.W., inasmuch as indi
   vidual        stris were most deeply cut at their N.W. ends (see
   Bketcb.es      in Fifth Report,      p. 30, and  plate viii. fig. 32).
        Boulders seen leaning against rocks on their east sides,                 as  if
    thereby stopped in          their progress eastwards.
         (7) Beinn-a-Bhune,         a  hill about 400    feet above   sea, mentioned
     by    Dr Geikie.       Rocks seen by Convener smoothed,          and boulders so
     situated as to show probable movement from               W.N.W.
         (8) Barvas Hills, 800 to 900 feet high, 5 miles north of Storno-
     way, examined by Convener, who found on them smoothed rock,
     and boulders indicating movement from              N.  and   N.W.
          (9)  In district    between    Barvas  Hills and   sea-coast to north there
     are long lines        of escars, composed      chiefly of coarse gravel, with
      boulders    lying occasionally      on their ridges ; these boulders   in many
      places piled on one another, and         in such  a  way  as to  show transport
      from    N.W.
           Several of these escars run for miles continuously, and reach            to
       the north coast, following         a direction generally N.W., with       occa
      sional deflections.

     When        viewed from top of Barvas                    Hills they form               a strikks
feature,     as     the   bright     green       of    the     grass      covering          them           can-

which they traverse.
     These escars reach to a height of from 30 to 50 feet                                      above the
adjoining flat ground              Atone     place (about 2              miles north           of Bams
Hills) an         escar expands and divides                  into a series of knolls,                        on
which many boulders now rest.                         The highest         knolls     have on thiffi
the greatest number of boulders.                      At two places the              boulders              form
groups, piled on one another.         They had formed (as was mentioned
by   a   shepherd) hiding places in times of trouble. Most of the boulders
on these      escars show transport                 X.W., but
                                                 from                             some      indicate             a
transport from W.S.W.              ; one    from X.N.E.
     In this part of        the    island    there are numerous                    lakelets,         whose
longer axis is generally parallel with the lines of escar,                          —a     factallthe
more       remarkable,      as    the outcrops of the gneiss                      rocks        generally
form lines in the direction of              N.E. and S.W.              and dipping S.E,
     l)r   Geikie     was much struck            with        this    fact, and       expressed              an
opinion that the formation of the escars and of these lakelets                                        must
be due      to    one and the same agency,                   viz.,   a    glacier     or       ice-sheet,
which came across the " Minch" from Ross-shire.
   (10) Along coast from Barvas, eastward, boulders of granite,
differing from any rocks near them, and alleged by a local mason
seen by Convener to be same as rocks 7 or 8 miles to westward.

1G feet,    called " Claehan Treudach"                  or    "Gathering          Stone,"

     Dr Geikie mentions those, and                  states  that similar       shells were
found by him in           a deposit stretching across          the north part of tho
Lewis, from shore to shore (Fifth Report,                  p. 36).
     (15) With        reference to the above-mentioned               group of islands,
sometimes called the Long Island, remarks                      of  a   general character
may not be inappropriate.
     Mr J. F. Campbell (formerly of Islay), author of Frost, and
Fire, wrote as follows to the Convener : —
      " In   the Long Island, from Barra Head to the Butt of Lewis, the
whole country is glaciated, with boulders everywhere perched on
the hills. Wherever the surface is newly exposed, the striations
and smoothings            are so perfect       that the marks can            be copied as
 '             '
    Brasses       are copied."
      In   a letter    from the same gentleman to               Mr Alex. Carmichael
 of the Inland Be venue,            a native      of the Hebrides,         the former re
 marks      :—
                 " Glacial  striae occur upon        fixed rocks in Tiree,        Mingley,
 Barra, South and North Uist, and correspond with                        a  direction from
 N.W. or thereabouts.              The     hills   are   ice-worn     to the very tops.
 Transported blocks are scattered over all these islands."
       13.   Skye. —The Convener regrets that the Committee received no
 report from this island ; nor had he an opportunity                         of visiting it
  himself, except at one           spot, viz., Loch Scavaig, on the west coast,
  where the steamboat stops for an hour to allow passengors                           to see
   Coriusk.        The Convener then saw and examined                    a   largo boulder
  (Lithograph No.         30,  Plate X.).       Its position, on     a  rock between the
  sea and the        adjoining lake, is described on           page 66,      Sixth Report.
  The rock on which it stands                 slopes    steeply   towards       W. by N.,
  and it is in so precarious            a  position     that  it must have been very
  gently let down by the agent, whatever it was, which transported it.
       Professor Heddle reported that in the year 1879 he walked along
   N.E. part of Skye from Aird Point to Portree, and partially among
   the hills, but saw no boulders.
        He visited Stainchol Island, situated off the             east coast, and found
   Cambrian Conglomerate             blocks, similar to what he had seen on tho
   Shiant Islands, and similar           also to the rocks existing          in the Lewis,

   822                 Proceedings     of the Royal      Society
   near Stornoway.        On Stainchol       shore the Professor found dulert
   boulder containing      Labradorite.        He  states that the parent         rock b
   situated about fifty yards to      N.X.W. (Sixth Report, p. 38).
      Judging     from what is casually said by Dr Macculloch                         ud
   Principal James Forbes, regarding boulders in Skye,                they      must be
   numerous and interesting.         Thus Forbes refers to boulders             "poimi
   upon others,   or fantastically balanced       on the tops  of elliptical
              "
   of rocks;     and Macculloch      says that the summits (on which stot
   of the boulders stand)      are not only       bare, but often very          narrow,
   while their declivities      are   steep,    and   sometimes      perpendicular.
   Macculloch    confesses  his inability to explain these phenomena.

  grained granite seen near Inverie House, lying on slate               rocks.
     On road towards Gussern, several boulders               of  interest      pointed
  out to Convener by late      Mr James Baird, the proprietor.
     At   height    of 360   feet   above sea,      and   near   sea-shore,       recks

 N.W. and S.E.
     A  large boulder, consisting of two fragments, pointed               out by Mr
 Baird, in    consequence    of his believing       that the boulder        had
 broken     by falling from    a  height,     and striking on the bar*            rock,
 where these fragments now lie.          The two fragments are four or              fit»
 feet apart.    Whilst the opposing surfaces correspond in             shape, thsy
 are so weathered, as to show that the fracture was not            of  recent data
    At summit level between Inverie and Gussern, there is a               horizontal
 terrace,  facing the sea, and at from 400 to 500 feet above               sea, with
 a number of boulders on it.

A   large knoll of red granite, at mouth of loch, has had its      W.N.W.
sides rounded, and partly striated up to 150 feet.         The S.E. side of
knoll rough and craggy {Eighth Report,         p. 29).
    On north shore there is       an   angular    Mock   27 x 27 x 11   feet,
apparently    moved 28 yards from a rocky cliff situated to       N.W., of
which it had    beeu part.   The hills on the Glen Sanda property, reach

   The author expresses belief that the phenomena may find                      expk-
ation in   the   recognition        of two movements,— one outward                  fee

   Notes on boulders, situated to the              west   of Fort-William,       by Mr
Colin Livingston,      teacher     of public school, Fort-William.
   The author enumerates          boulders and striated rocks on west            side of
Ben Nevis, and expresses a confident opinion that two glaciers                 existed,
the one descending Glen Nevis, the other Glen Spean and Glen                      More.
   He refers    to   immense         mounds and ridges          of detrital     matter,
(having an imperfect stratification) towards Inverlochy and Toriundy,
— such as might have been produced, if it fell from some height
(Eighth Report,     pp. 23, 27).
   6.  Since the time when Mr Livingstone's                   Notes    (given in      the
Eighth Report) were framed, he has made a further inspection of                      the
hills to the W. and S.W. of Ben Nevis, and has communicated                            to
Convener the following additional facts: —
   Slob Ban, reaching a height of 3274                  feet above sea, is situated
west of Glen Nevis.         It  is composed of quartzite, which accounts for
its Gaelic name of White Pin.                Boulders of this rock      are found to
the eastward,    on various parts of the west slopes of Ben Nevis.
   Another    hill of interest       is   " Midloch-Nan-Coirean,"          3077   feet,
having a rounded top of red granite.                On its top there is      a slab of
mica slate.     How it     came there,       Mr Livingstone says is a mystery.
He admits that mica         slate     rock exists in large quantities towards
Sghor Challum, a       hill  1823 feet, situated to the west.            But   he sees
the difficulty  of conceiving that any glacier could have               brought    it
   On the same        hill  there     are   boulders of micaceous         gneiss and
quartz.    The quartz boulders, he says, may have                  come from Slob
Ban ; the birthplace of        the gneiss boulders is (he says) uncertain.
   7.  Notes on Ben Nevis and Craig Dhu, by Professor                     Heddle     of
St Andrews,      were sent       to   Committee.         He  expresses   an opinion
that  a glacier swept down Glen Nevis,               even overtopping       a hill of
3077 feet.     He also suggested the probable existence of              another vast
glacier cradled in the gorges between Aonach Beg and                  Aonach Mof.
   8.  Ben Nevis. — Convener ascended                to top, by     a path leading
up the   N.W.    side   of hilL        Enormous      boulders of grey     granite
                                                                                   lie
on  N.W.   slopes.   A few     on each side of path were measured, and#*w

the following results: — 16 x                 10 x 10 feet (118 tons)         (partially sunk
in gravel); 15x7x5                 feet (lying on bare rock)         ;   13x7x4            feet; one
nearly cubical, the sides being each about 4 feet square. The first
three have longer axis N.W. They are from 900 to 1200 feet above
sea.         But there    are some, up         to 2000       feet    above    sea.         Mr Doig,
builder, Fort-William, who accompanied Convener, mentioned that
there had been one boulder at the foot of mountain, on its N.W.
side,     so large as to afford materials for             building the entire front wall
of the Town Hospital of Fort- William.
   Mr Doig stated that he considered that                       the boulders on west flank
of     the mountain          were generally           different     from Ben Nevis rocks
(Fifth        Report,    p. 65).
     9.      On Treshlik      Hill,    1566 above sea, on north               side of Linnhe
Loch (opposite to Fort- William), Convener, under guidance of Mr
Livingstone, inspected a coarse-grained granite block, 8 feet high,
52 feet below summit, on west slope of hill. This hill forms a
ridge about half             a mile     long,        running W.S.W.            Rocks in situ
are clay slate.             Boulder     must have been transported                        from some
 westerly        point,    and put down              very gently, as slope exceedingly
 steep where boulder rests (Lithograph No. 31, Plate                                 X.) (Second
 Report, p. 161).
   Rocks on north and west sides of                    hill near top     are well smoothed ;
 rocks on S. E. side of                hill    are rough.         The smoothed rocks are
 chiefly on a space along north side of hill, from 30 to 60 feet below
 summit.           Many coarse-grained                granite     blocks,    and          water-worn
 pebbles, lie along north face of               hill near the top.
       10.    Boleskien,     Abertarff,       and Dores. — Well              rounded          granite
 boulders        of red and grey varieties occur over district of Strath*
 errick.         One above ground             measured      20 x 10 x 7 feet, and there
 seemed to be as much below.                    Its longer axis N. and               S.     Another
 at Fall of Foyers measured      (above ground) 12x6x6 feet.
       Several are poised on tops of isolated hills. Highest hills in this
 district      about 2900 feet above sea.                 Boulders are chiefly above the
 level of 2350 feet.               Below this level they          are generally of a smaller
 siie.        Reported by Captain White,                RE  (Second Report, p. 137).

 fessor Heddle, having visited                 it,   expressed an opinion that the large

    The following cases of boulders were reported by the Convener —                          :
     On the summit of the hills, at the           Glen Roy (1320 feet

 bare    rock, but traces of clay and gravel in their vicinity suggest
that they may originally have been embedded in drift, which has
been since mostly washed away from under and about them " (Edin.

     The late Charles Darwin, who visited Lochaber,                              and wrote an
 instructive memoir on the "Parallel Roads" question, refers to the
                 —
 Ben Erin hills, their height reaching to 1600 feet above the sea.
 He says that " on the mountains between Glen Roy and Glen
 Glony, on   hillock N.N.W. of the summit of Ben Erin,
                 a                                           found                    I

the surface of the          gneiss.    This hillock             seemed to be entirely com
posed of the latter rock, and          it   was separated from all other hills by                a
valley.         On the flanks of Ben Erin, at about the                      same level, there
were several boulders of granite." — "With respect to these Ben Erin
boulders, they are completely cut off from every granite district by
valleys, the highest point            of which      is   920 feet below a boidder, the

his   estate, east of       Loch Laggan (one of                these   hills exceeding 3000
feet in height), there are large granite boulders.
   Sir John Ramsden guided the Convener to the Wester Beinin Hill
(situated on the west side of Loch Laggan) to see several grey
granite boulders. The rocks of the hill are red granite. One of the
boulders     is   on   a   shelf about 1516 feet above the sea, on the side
of   a   hill sloping down to W.S.W.

the Fassnacloich               species of black granite.
                             boulders,      a              Specimens
were sent to    Mr Judd of London, on account of his personal know-
ledgo    of rocks in the West Highlands.   His opinion was that the
rock of the boulder was identical with rocks                                in Mull       and Ardoa-
murchan, from which district, therefore,                            he supposed the             boulders
may probably have been transported.
  On the shore of the Linnhe Loch, at Appiiu, there are two bug*
well-rounded boulders of the same kind of granite. Their position
favours    Mr Judd's suggestion, that all                           these      boulders     had        been
transported from the westward.

tioned in Lochabcr, are of  dark colour. Is apossible that
                                                           the              it
mountains of Mull and Ardnamurchan could have supplied all these
boulders when the sea stood 2000 foot or more above its present
level? (Fourth Report, p.
                          45).
  1 2i. Ardgour district, on north side of Linnhe Loch.— Professor
Hoddlo of St Andrews, in Seventh Report,         36, states tbaf on       p.
Stub Choire a Chearchaill                  he found    a    trainee of boulders lying                along
the ridge for nearly              a   mile, at heights varying from                  2400       to   ^
feet above       the       sea.       The direction of the trainee                   was    HJf.w.
Most of these boulders consisted of syenite, with red                             felspar crystals

and green hornblende.           Thinking that      these boulders might also be
found on the south side of the Linnhe Loch, he crossed, and on two
hills   there, viz.,   Bein Bhan, at      a height   of 1500 feet, and on Beinn
na Oumig, at       a height of 2017 feet, he found boulders             of the same
syenite as he had found on the north side of the loch.
    In   the Eighth Bepori (p. 33) Professor Heddle mentions his dis
covery of more boulders of the same peculiar syenite, as seen by him
on hills nearer Ben Nevis and on Ben Nevis itself, at an altitude of
2200 feet.      This discovery led him to change his opinion               as to the
direction of the transport of these boulders.
    13.  Loch Creran. — The boulders there were examined by Professor
Heddle. He was much puzzled to explain from what district they
came.      There    were striae on the rocks of the hills adjoining,               at
heights     exceeding 2000 feet above the sea.               He was inclined       to
think that the boulders had             crossed   the Linnhe Loch from Loch
Sunart and Glen Tarbert
    On    some   of the hills of this district boulders           were discovered
at heights exceeding 2000           feet,  which Professor Heddle was satis
fied must have       crossed  valleys to reach their positions, and by means
of floating ice (Sixth Report, p. 43).
    14. Glencoe District. — On the western           slopes of a hill, in the higher
part of Glencoo, near Loch Tulla, boulders of a peculiar white
granite were found by Professor Heddle.                 They were different from
the adjoining rocks. He already knew that the rocks in the hills
to the eastward were also different;              so,  in expectation of finding
the parent rocks,        a search    towards the west was commenced.              On
reaching      the Aonach-Eagach           range of hills      the   same    kind of
boulders were      seen, fewer    in number, but larger in       size.    They were
lying chiefly on the eastern side of the narrow ridge leading up to
the summit of the         nameless   peak marked 2938 feet on the Ordnance
map.       On the next rounded haunch (2880 feet) they were not                 seen,
but they reappeared on the ridge            as  it ascended to the     eastern  peak
of Meal      Dearg     (3090 feet), and almost up to tho summit of the
•western peak (3118 feet).
                                    " Their position," adds Professor Heddle,
was most peculiar.           They lay on       a ridge not     many times wider
than their own bulk, and only on the eastern                slopes   of that ridge   ;
•while on the lower hills, where they were first seen, the same boulder
 lay on the west slopes" (Sixth Report,            p. 44).    "It  is a fact of con
 siderable importance, bearing on any theory of transport, that these

                                                                                              I

difficult,  if  not impossible, to adopt for them the explanation oi n;

   In the following year, Professor Heddle returned to the                       Bani:-.':
district, to search for any farther traces of this stream, of white                 grant
boulders.       To the S.E. of Loch Rannoch he found two hills, fo
Charn and Creag Mhor (2595 and 2250 feet), forming a sort of
ridge running nearly N. and S., and so situated as to cross whit
might have been the line of stream.                Two boulders            found,       each
weighing about         7  tons, very similar in colour and composition                     tt
Loch Tulla boulders.           He next     proceeded    to Schehallion,           sitnatal
about   3  miles farther east, and found on its western slope,                about HO
feet below the summit, i.e., 3407 feet above the sea, a boulder                           of
the  Loch Tulla      group,   about throe -quarters of a ton in weight
   Reference is made to other geologists             who had previously            found
boulders on Schehallion, near its top — one being Robert                     Chambers,
who concluded from the striations on the rocks of Schehallion,

      Mr Jamieson of Ellon adverts to this same drift accumulation,
3cnown as Tornain Hill, in the following terms : — " There are masses
of coarse      water-worn gravel rudely piled together, 200 feet thick. The
 stones are all water-rolled, and show no glacial striaj. The pebbles
 are of various kinds of metamorphic and crystalline                    schists,   red
 sandstones, conglomerates,         granites, and porphyries. These materials

 High Street, with pillar on it supporting town armorial bearings.
  Stone had formerly stood at top of cliff above River Ness, and from
   time immemorial        afforded   a convenient rest for the tubs or pitchers
  in which the women brought up water for household                  use.    When     a
  supply of water       was brought into the town by pipes, the magistrates
   proposed to break up the boulder, but the townspeople objected                    at
   first even to its removal.       A  compromise     was come to by the boulder
   being shifted to the side of the street, opposite to the Court-Ilouse,
   and by the erection on it of the Town Arms (First Report, p. 18).

to Convener by Mr Jolly. It lies on gneiss rock, and on very edge
of a precipice of 100 feet vertically below    on its N.E. side. In

almost certainly on floating ice.
   On the       same      hill there    are other boulders of smaller size, whose
position in like manner             suggests    transport from westward.

district   is   Loch Faraline, about           15 miles westward.
   One of these boulders              is    21 x 20 x 14 feet (218 tons) at 983 feet
above sea.       Another about         same size, and at about 1259 feet above sea
has its sharp end towards west.                  The    east end      is   broad, and butted
up against      a   gneiss rock, which would obstruct its passage eastward.
 On this gneiss rock there            are   E. and W.    striae,    which might have been
made by the boulder pushing and pressing hard pebbles over the rock.

    7. Generally. — Large rounded fragments of granite and syenite
 abundantly          scattered     over Stewartry,        and    so     arranged    as   to
 indicate     that they have been dispersed by some force proceeding
 from N.W. (Sixth Report,                p.  27 ;   Highland Society's Trans., vol.

    Professor Harkness, in the year 1870, made known to the Lon
 don Geological Society his discovery of Criffel granite boulders in
 Cumberland.            In his   paper (published in the Quarterly            Journal for
November 1870,              p. 522) he states that     "this Criffel granite occurs

 838                    Proceedings    of the Royal Society
not only in the form of blocks on the surface, but also in the                 hiie
       "
clays.      The Criffel granite blocks are also common in the                  hodm
        of the vale of Eden.          He    adds that   there   are also     " Edxri
clays
in the valley, which yield blocks of Criffel granite."
    In the Ninth Report of the English Boulder Committee,                        an tt-
count is given of the boulders found while excavating for                     the ne*
docks at Maryport,        on the south side of the       Sol way    ; among them
were granite blocks, varying        in  size from pebbles to blocks of           a ton.
It  is remarked in the        Report that
                                              " the nearest granite        occurs in
" Kirkcudbrightshire Hills,        15 or 20 miles distant, nearly due north*
    In the Fifth Report of the English Boulder Committee (Br. An
Pr. for 1877, p. 82) there is notice of a Criffel granite boulder found
near Liverpool       in excavating for new docks.         It is added " that Mi
J.  Geikie and Mr Home pronounced specimens which were sent to
them to be from the outskirts of the Criffel granite area"
    There is ground for believing that Criffel granite boulders                  occur
even so far south as Lancashire.           Mr Mellard Reade of           Liverpool,
C.E    and F.L.G.S., wrote in the course of 1882 to the Conraier,
that having for some years, while investigating               the drift     deposits
near Liverpool,       collected specimens      from boulders, some of          which
were    evidently derived from rocks different from any               belonging      to
that part of England,         he   wished to submit these          to any person
known to the Convener to be well acquainted with the rocks                     of the
S.W. of Scotland.           The Convener having suggested            Mr   Dudgeon
of Cargen, Dumfriesshire,         Mr Reade transmitted         the specimens         to
him, the result of which is explained in the following                   extract of
a  letter from Mr Reade to the Convener —
    "Mr    Dudgeon recognises        with certainty Criffel      granite, having
assured     himself     of its identification     by   having     seen    in    s°me
of the specimens         submitted to him the minerals sphene             and alla-
nite,   which    ho    is not aware     occur in any other granitic distill
nearer    than Aberdeenshire and Sutherland.               He also thinks       some
of the granites come from veins in the Silurian rocks               about 7 miles
from Dumfries." *

      Mr M.   Resrdo has since (Feb. 1884) read in the London Geological Society
                                                                                   0

from Kilpatrick Hills to N.W., and others from Campsie Hills to N.E.
    (2) At Brickwork, near Garscube Road, sandstone rocks, also
striated from N.W., and more deeply than at Possil.
    At this     place, numerous boulders          of old red conglomerate, grey
granite,     schists,   &c, supposed to be from Bonaw and Kilpatrick
Hills    to N.W. (Second Report,          p. 165).
                                   Linlithgowshire.
     1.  Bonnington District.       — (1) On Pumpherston       estate, the "Ballen-
geich Boulder," in girth 10 or 12 feet; but now broken                      up into
eight fragments.          It is  a coarse   dolerite, of which no rocks nearer
than Bathgate Hills, about.           2 miles to    N.W.      Had been about 60
tons in weight.         The boulder was lying on boulder clay.
    Not far from this boulder there is another of quartzite, about                 a
quarter of      a  ton in weight, and containing crystals of green mica,
most probably transported from Highlands.
    (2) On Tornain Hill, Bonnington Farm, occupied by Mr James
Melvin, another dolerite boulder, known as the " Witch's Stone,"
about same size as that at Pumpherston,             and about same height above
sea, viz., 431      feet.    It   lies on a slope which faces        W.N.W.      On
digging below the boulder, Mr Melvin found it resting on decom
posed trap.          Nearest rock      of same kind is on Bathgate            Hills,
situated 5 miles       W.N.W.
    There is a valley between Tornain            Hill  and Bathgate Hills, across
which boulder had probably              been transported.       If a line be drawn
from this boulder to Bathgate Hills, it            passes close  to " Ballengeich "
boulder.
    This    boulder also has been broken into six fragments.                  Some
archaeological interest         attaches to boulder, as on one of its frag
ments there are        " cup markings."
    (3) Formerly, on S.E. side of Tornain, another dolerite boulder,
read he exhibited      chips from these boulders and the parent rocks for com
 parison.     In this paper there is a becoming acknowledgment that Mr
 Mackintosh had been the first to refer the Lancashire granite boulders to
 Criffel (£. O. S. Trans, vol. xl p. 270).

the   " Catstone," bearing a very ancient Latin inscription,          which     the
lato   Sir James Y. Simpson deciphered, is described by               him as "a
massive unhewn block of secondary greenstone,              many large    boulders
of which lio in the bed of the neighbouring river."                The   block is
7 feet   3  inches in length and 12 feet in circumference               (Proe. of
Society   of Scotch Antiquaries,       vol. iv. p. 122).
                      Midlothian or Edinburghshire.
    1.  Pent I and   fit I Is. — The late Charles Maclaren        was   the   first
who described         e  boulders on these hills.     The  one  of most interest
is of mica slate, weighing           8 or 10 tons.      The nearest spot     from
which it could have come is at or near Loch Vennacher or Loch
Earn, about 80 miles to the          N.W.
   With reference to the transport of this boulder, Mr Maclaren
says: — To reach the spot where it lies, it must have passed over
          "
extensive tracts of country from 500 to 600 feet lower                 than   this
spot     Even    were    all Scotland converted into a mer de         glace, like
Greenland, no moving mass in the shape of a glacier could carry               this
boulder (and there are many such) from its native seat in Perthshire
or Argyleshire to Habbie's Howe.               An iceberg from the North or
West Highlands, and floating in a sea 1500 or 2000 feet above                 the
present level of the Atlantic, is an agent capable of effecting               the
transportation of the stone, and offers,         I think, the only  conceivable
solution of the problem " (Edin. Few             Phil. Journal,  1846, p. 138).
Referring to this boulder, and to another, also of mica slate, on the
Pcntlands, weighing about three quarters of a ton, the late           Professor

                      of Edinburgh,       Session 1883-84.                         841
Nicol remarked :— " When it is considered that these masses must
have been carried upwards of 40 miles in a direct line, floating ico
seems the only agent to which their transportation                can be ascribed"
                                                                    "
(Lond. Geol. Soc. Journal, voL v. p. 23). He adds: — Some of these
Pentland Hill boulders are of kinds of rock which have never seen I
in Scotland.        On  one    hill, 1500 to 1600     feet high,     I  found these
travelled stones particularly        abundant, and apparently increasing in
number from below upwards.             In  some places they appeared          to form
broad     bands, running nearly         in straight     lines from      N.N.W.        to
S.S.E.,   — and without any reference to the           present declivity of the
ground, — except becoming more numerous                 towards the summit of
            "
the ridge      (Sixth Report, p. 26).
    A   number of rock surfaces occur on the Pentlands                   with    stria?.
Mr James Croll, of        the Scotch Geological Survey, describes one of
these on the very summit of Allermuir            Hill,  at a height of 1617 feet
above the sea.       On examining the        strise he says      he had no      " diffi
culty in determining        that the ice which effected          them came from
the   west.   On the summit of the hills          we found    patches of boulder
clay in hollow basins of the rock.          Of one hundred pebbles collected
from the clay, every       one,  with the exception of three or four com
posed of hard quartz, presented a flattened and ice-worn                      surface,
and forty-four were distinctly stratified.          A  number of these          stones
 must have come from the Highlands to the                 N.W." (Fifth Report,
p. 82).
    In like   manner, Professor Geikie, in his interesting Memoir on the
                                                                            "
 Geology    of the Neighbourhood of Edinburgh, observes that boulder
 clay lies along the N.W. flanks of tho Pentlands, rising to a level of
 at least 1300    feet.   "When the clay has been removed, we usually
 find the rocks below polished, grooved, and scratched, in                a direction
 nearly E. and W. or        E.S.E. and W.S.W.            The parallelism of the
 striations throughout the present district shows that the floating ico
 must have moved in          a pretty   uniform direction      ;   and that it was
 from the     west, is rendered clear,       by the striation       of the western
 faces of the hills, by the great depth of drift on their eastern                sides,
 and by the fact that the transported boulders, when traceable to
 their parent rock, have been carried from W. to E.                    Tho drift in
 this district indicates      a period    of slow submergence, which went
 on until probably every        hill had sunk far below the           sea-level,    and
 when ice-borne blocks from the snow-covered islots of Isla or the

  842                 Proceedings      of the    Royal Society
 Grampians, were dropped on the submarine                    slopes    of the        Peni-
 lands" (Memoir No. 33, p. 127) (Fifth Report, p. 18).
     2. Edinburgh and Suburbs. — The late Charles Maclaren,                        in    hi-
  Geology     of Fife and      the Lothians,       published    in 1838,       refers to
 boulders which he found on or near Arthur's Seat, the Castle                          Hill,
 and Calton      HilL
     On Arthur's Seat, about twenty or thirty boulders are                     specified
 up to 30 tons, most          of which he identified        with rocks     situated       to
 the    west of the boulders.            Others (of sandstone) he found                   at
 much higher levels than any sandstone rocks now on the adjoining
 hills  (p. 64, 2nd edition).
     To  the east of the Castle       Hill, numerous boulders         are mentioned
 as  having been found to the eastward,               which are with     good    reason
 referred to the Castle rock          ;  but other boulders          are   mentioned
 (p. 91) as having       been   found on the west side of the Castle                rock,
 which must be referred to some more distant locality.
     It is right for Convener to notice a Conglomerate boulder               standing
 on a stone     pillar in the public    gardens at the     foot of  the Castle     rock.
 It  was brought there as an ornament to the gardens             by Mr   Henderson,
 nurseryman, who had been entrusted by the magistrates with                     the ar
 rangement of the gardens.           He had found it in his own        Nursery Gar
 dens,  Leith Walk.      It is probably a true erratic, hailing    from Callander.
     On the Calton Hill, boulders            are mentioned       by Mr      Maclaren
 as found there, " of the very peculiar syenitic greenstone of Cor-
                    "
 storphino Hill (p. 72).
     In the year 18-17,* a new road (at the expense of Government),
 was made round        Arthur's    Seat, which      required an excavation        to be
made on the        S.W. side of     the  hill, between the main        body of        the
 hill and      an   outlying    knoll known          on account    of its     basaltic
 columns     as
                " Sampson's ribs," at height of 390 feet above the sea.
     The hollow between the hill and the knoll was excavated to a
depth of 20 or 30 feet, in order to lessen the steepness of                          the
road.      Thereby a trough or gully, with rocky sides sloping                steeply
towards      the axis     of the gully, was disclosed.           The axis of        the
trough was about          N.W. and S.E.        ;  its length about     120    yards;
its width at the narrowest part where the road was                    made,     about
                                                                                   the
10 yards.       As the rocky     sides of the    gully sloped   down towards
   *
      The particulars here given will be found in a paper by the           Convener
published in the New Edinburgh Philosophical Journal for January          1847

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                              843
 axis,   these   sides would probably meet below              ;  but the excavation
 for the road did not reach that point. The gully had been filled
 with till, and contained numerous boulders, — almost all of which
were found to be different from any of the rocks on Arthur's Seat,
viz.,    felspar,     greenstone,     porphyry,      limestone      (both     lacustrine
 and marine),         quartz,    greywacke,      with fragments        of    shale and
coal.
    Many of      these    blocks were found        in contact with both sides of
the gully.        The largest blocks were near the north                    end.     The
large blocks were well rounded              ;    the small blocks less so.           One
large boulder on the west side of the gully appeared                    to have been
pressed against the rock there, and                 had    stuck   in that position,
being rounded            and   also partially striated       on its     N.E.     side, —
an     indication       of the friction it         had    undergone,     by    materials
 forced through the gully from a           N.W. direction.
    The gully was not throughout of equal breadth                  ;  at its narrowest
point, the sides (when the boulder clay and drift were cleared away)
¦were   found     at one place to be about            15   feet nearer one another
than     elsewhere.        The   rocks on     the east side had been ground
 down, smoothed, and striated, some of the striae being continuous
for nearly     6 feet,   and   J of an inch deep.
    Generally,      the striae     were   horizontal;       but at     and near the
narrowest part of the gully the strioe were seen to rise up at an
 angle    of   4° or     5° ; — caused  probably       by the obstruction        to the
drift when being forced through the gully.
    One     peculiarity      in the striations      deserves    notice,    as   showing
 the direction       from which the striating           agent moved.         The    striaa
 were most numerous a^fl deepest               on the east side, suggesting that
the striating agent had moved in               a  direction from a more westerly
point than N.W.             The rock surfaces facing the          S. and    S.W. were
neither striated nor smoothed.
    There is another spot, on the south side of Arthur's Seat, worthy
 of notice, on account of the boulders there, and the position occupied
 by them.         It   is on the west side of         Windy Gowl.           "When the
 new road was being made there, a thick bed of clay and sand, in
 stratified   layers, was exposed to view.               In this  bed,    many blocks
 from the overhanging rocks of the            hill were found embedded.              The
 bed of sand and clay had been formed round these boulders, showing

blocks of stone, which                 were of the same              nature          as    the rocks          of
Arthur's       Seat, there were         in this   bed of sand and clay blocks                         foreign
to Arthur's Seat (brought from the west probably), viz., red                                       compact
felspar,       red     syonitic    porphyry,        marine limestone,                 and       clay    iron

existing in the immediate neighbourhood, but belonging                                        to localities
in the far west.            Most of them were on their upper                               surfaces flit,
smooth,         and striated, the striae             running          in        directions        varying
between        N.W. and W.N.W.
    At      the sea-shore,        between   Joppa and Magdalen                    Bridge, the Con

boulder examined by Convener and Mr Stevenson, C.E., 4| x 4 x 2
feet, buried in a knoll of muddy sand, discovered on removal of the

and soft, such      as quartz, shale, coal.     Height above    sea 200 feet.
Sides of boulder well rounded.            Smallest   end of boulder pointed

more deeply cut on under than on upper surface.                 The striae on
under surface showed they had begun to              be formed at east end of
boulder, probably       by the boulder having      boon pushed towards east,
over hard rocks.           The striae on upper surface showed         that    the
tools which formed them had acted on the boulder first at west end.
    6. Grant on. — The sandstone rocks at the Old Quarry near the
sea were covered by boulder clay, which had embedded in it many
blocks derived from Linlithgow and Stirling shires.             The    striae on
their upper surfaces all run E. and W., viz., a direction               parallel

    At Oranton Harbour, on the west side of, at the           shore,  there are
two large whinstone         boulders, with striae on their upper surfaces,
the direction of which is W.         3" S. (magnetic).
    7. Leith Docks. — In new Albert Docks excavations were made
in the boulder clay, in       course of   which  a number of large boulders
were found.
    They consisted mostly of blue whinstone, also            some   of quartz,
limestone,     greywacke, sandstone, aud black         ironstone   concretions
derived   from beds of coal and shale.            On most of the boulders
there were smoothed surfaces and striae, bearing nearly              the same
direction, viz., points between       W. and N.
   Among      these  there were two metallic boulders, which, having             a
strange appearance,      were brought to the Convener by the Inspector
of Works    ;   and to Professor Crurn Brown (of Edinburgh University),
tho Convener submitted them for examination. One, nearly spheri
cal, measuring     1\ inches in circumference, and weighing       26 oz., had
been found about        \\  feet down in the clay bed, among the general           <U+2666>
mass   of boulders.       The other, more exactly spherical,     measured       in
girth 30 inches one way and           31 inches transversely, and weighed
54 lbs.    It   was found 10 feet below the top of the boulder clay bed.

   846                  Proceedings        of  the  Royal Society
      Professor Crum Brown having analysed                     both balls,       reported tk
   largest   to have    a specific     gravity of 3-36,        and to be         composed       of
  silica 52*3 per cent, and of pyrites 47-7 per cent                      The    smallest lid
  a specific    gravity of    4 "63,   and was found to consist of the                pure ore
  of white iron pyrites or marcasite, unmixed                      with any        other    sub
   stance.
      Mr Murray, of the "Challenger" Expedition, having kindly                           under
   taken to examine the larger ball, reported that a microscopic                               ex
  amination      revealed that it consisted             " of crystalline          particles     of
  quartz and marcasite.            The marcasite        fills the interstices         between
  the grains of quartz         ;  and among the quartz              there      are   pieces of
   mica."
      Mr Charles Peach           at the     same     time     informed        the Convener
  that in several      districts    to the west (viz.,        Falkirk,     Slamarman,       and
  Kilsyth)     there   are beds       of shale      and coal,      containing       ironstone
  nodules, known among the miners as                  " brassy balls,"       some of which
  contain marcasite.         Ho added that " the direction of                  the dries and
  carry of the boulders in this (the Kilsyth) district is E or E. 5' N.
  Either of these sources (he remarked) could supply "both" at Leith,
                                                                        "
  as they are right in the direction of the " ice-flow                     (Fourth Report,
  p. 29).
      In   consequence    of   the foregoing information,             the Convener        went
  to Campsie (about 8 miles             N.E      from Glasgow), and in             the work
  ings of coal and shale           there    he    obtained several ironstone             balls,
  which, on being submitted              to Professor Crum Brown,                he reported
  contained almost exactly the same constituents                        as the specimens
  found at Leith.           He added,        that "deducting the              coaly matter,
  the iron and sulphur           were     in the proportion          in which       they are
  generally found in marcasite,               viz., iron 45'6,       and sulphur 5i'S.
  As   to chemical compositions, therefore, the small metallic boulder
  may     be considered as exactly agreeing                with the     nodules found in
  the Campsie coal strata."
      With regard     to the larger ball, not so purely metallic, Mr Hutchi
  son of Carlowrie having accidentally seen                  in  the Convener's        house,
t Edinburgh,      the specimen        excavated from the Leith boulder                   clay,
  informed the Convenor that balls of the same appearance,                        and much
  larger,    were   found in sandstone            rocks quarried at Dahneny               and
                  The                                                                     and
  Humbie.                Convener thereupon visited                these     quames,

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                           847
saw several specimens of                  such balls, "apparently      concretions in
the rock Having brought                  one or two specimens      to Edinburgh,       ho
submitted them to Professor Crum Brown, who                       reported    that they
"    consist externally of        a  thin shell of sandstone,    and internally of a
mixture        of quartz and marcasite, closely resembling the substance of
the      large    ball from Leith.         The mean specific gravity of the ball
was       3-49."
      These     facts regarding the two metallic boulders found           in  the  Leith
boulder        clay, therefore    afford strong presumptive evidence          that they
had       been     transported across Scotland, along with            other bouldres,
whose parent rocks occur              also in the west.
      As   to the mode of transport,          Mr reach, in his letter      to the Con
 vener (printed on p. 29 of Fourth Boulder Report), whilst allowing
 that the balls might have come from Kilsyth or Slamannan, in con
 formity with the general " direction of the striae and carry of the
 boulders in this district," viz., E., or E.          5° N., suggested       "ic&flow"
 as the medium of transport, but without                   explaining      whether ho
 meant       sea ice or    land ice.
      "With    reference     to this question, it is right to keep in view that
  the Campsie district, from which the metallic boulders               are assumed to
  have come, is only 150 feet above the present sea-level                  ;  and that,
  as   this district     is about 30 miles distant       from Leith, the gradient
  would not         bo sufficient for the movement of a glacier, even           if there
  had    been mountains at or near            Campsie sufficiently high to have
  generated       a  glacier.*
       8. Alnwick       Hill, near Liberton. — Excavations having           been made
  in the boulder clay         here, for the formation of largo water reservoirs,
   innumerable        boulders were excavated.          They    were    chiefly whin-
   stones, felspar, porphyries, limestones, and Old            Eed Sandstone — all
   most probably from the           N.W.
       Some of these boulders showed strise both on the under and the
   upper sides, the direction of which was approximately N.W. (Fourth
   Report, p. 29).
       Inchheith. — The Convener visited the island, under the guidance
   of Colonel Muggridge,         E.E., and found that the rocks consist chiefly
   of basalt and porphyry, intruding among                coal strata.      In various

         A small map of district, given afterwards in       reference   to Stirlingshire
   boulders,   may here be referred to.

 848                         Proceedings     of   the   Royal Society
 places, the rocks were covered by beds                         of boulder-clay,        gravel, and
 occasionally sand
    The Inspector of Works informed tbe Convener, that at tbe eaa
 end of the island, when removing a bed of shingle (about 60 fee:
 above the sea), he had picked up out of the shingle two pebbles of
 red granite, about the size of a hen's egg.                          Thinking     it    curious         to
 find granite there,            he had     laid them aside,             but could           not      now
 find them.
    The      Convener, having been informed                         that there   was a shingly
 beach    at the        N.W. end of the island, descended to                      it,   and found
 largo pebbles of granite (both red and grey), gneiss, quartz, and                                   hard
 Silurian rocks.
    On the highest part of the island (west of the Lighthouse)                                  at 182
 feet above the sea, the rocks on portions of the                       hill facing     the N.W.
 have    been planed down              to even surfaces by some              agency from             the
 W.      No    striae   were distinguishable {Sixth Report,                 p.   26).

across the Moray             Firth.
  Convener heard of another boulder of same description                             in   a   higher
part of the hill, to the eastward.
   Elgin. — Boulder called " Garlin's                 Stone,"        on Bogton Farm,          about
230 feet above           sea;   a     coarse Conglomerate.             About half       a   mile      to
N. W".   a   smaller Conglomerate boulder, called " Young Cetrlin's Sim"
(First Report,          p.   31, and Second Report, p. 152).
   There are no Conglomerate rocks in the low-lying districts, where
these boulders are situated. Wherever they have come from, they
must have been carried.
   Conglomerate rocks exist in the bills to the south, distant                              5   or   6
miles.       Convener was informed by              Mr Martin,           teacher, Elgin (well
acquainted with the rocks of the district), that the Conglomerate /or-
mations in the hills are, in mineralogical composition, distinguish*^

from the Conglomerate boulders in the counties of Moray, Nairn,
and Banff. Two other sources were considered by him more pro-
bable — Cromarty              to the     N.W., and the hills near the               east end of
the Caledonian Canal.
   Throughout the county there                    are hundreds of rounded               boulders
of granite, gneiss, and mica slate, whose                     shape    suggests that they
have been pushed or rolled over the surfaca                          These are chiefly em
bedded in gravel, clay, and sand.
   Pluscardine         Hill     has had lodged on its north slope a number of
boulders       which have apparently                 come     from N.W.             There      is a
gneiss boulder,         13x8x6           feet, about 46 tons, called       "Chapel Stone,"
situated      to     west of Pluscardine Chapel               ;   also a Syenite         boulder,
12x8x3             feet, about        13 tons.     The rocks        in situ    here      are   Old
Red Sandstone.
   GardenHill forms                a rocky sandstone range         running about E. andW.
Between       it and Pluscardine Hill, there is               a    shallow valley, through
which boulders may have been rafted to their present sites in an
easterly direction.             The two Carlin Stones might have come that way.
   The rocks along ridge of Carden Hill, have been ground down by
some agent which has passed over it from N.W. Many boulders of
granite and gneiss lie on the ridge, most of which have longer axis
N.W.     by   W.       Some lie along ridge, on its northern edge, apparently
stopped there in their farther progress                  ;   others lie on south side of
ridge,   as   if    pushed over        it,   and placed beyond reach of transporting
agent.
   Blocks of the Carden                  Hill   sandstone rock are also there,                as   if
broken off the ridge by the agent which                 passed over from north.                The
ridge of Carden             Hill   extends for about    a    mile, and    is   at   a   height of
400 feet above         sea.
   Many smoothed and striated surfaces                   are visible,     the direction of

with popular names, described in First Report, p. 42 {Lithograph No.
34, Plato X.). There are granite rocks in hills to south, on which
blocks of Old Red Sandstone lie, and in such quantities that they are
gathered for the building of walls. These blocks probably came from
the north, where there are rocks of the same kind {First Report, p.
42, and Second Report, p. 166) {Lithograph No. 36, Plate X.).
    On " Piper's Hill," where rocks are Old Red Sandstone, a Con
 glomerate boulder, weighing about 10 tons, lies on the N.W. side of
 a gravel kaim.    These Conglomerate boulders are all mineralogically
 similar, being composed of quartz, limestone, syenite, felspar, and
 other hard angular pebbles. Most of them are partly buried in sandy
 drift.  The district on which they lie slopes down towards N.W.,
  and is about 200 feet above sea, from which distant about a mile.
     The longer axis of these boulders is chiefly N.W., and on that
  side they present smooth surfaces, whilst east side is rough and
  angular         (see Diagram            8   in Second       Report, and           p.   166,   and   also

     Captain "White of Ordnance Survey informed Convener that,
  having tried           to find out where these boulders came from, he was                             of
  opinion that they             had come from Ross-shire.
        He reported           also having met          with    gTanite boulders (both red and
   grey varieties) — the largest                 12 x 8    Jx8        feet, and     with longest axis

    The late Dr Patrick Neill states that,            if this    boulder     came
from Stromness, it would have to cross several arms of                   the sea

   In a paper on the " Glaciation of the Orkneys," by Messrs Peach
and Home of the Government Scotch Geological Survey (London
Geological Society's Journal for November 1880), it is said that
" boulders      do not occur very plentifully."                The only island in which
boulders       are mentioned as seen            by them, is Westra, where " blocks
of granite and quartzite            are on the slopes     of Cleat      Hill ;    and rounded
boulders of red sandston* from Eda occur in the southern district,                              as
well as along the western shores." Messrs Peach and Home state
" that the only part of the Orkneys which has granite or other crys
talline rocks is at Stromness, where they form a strip about 4 miles
long by 1 in breadth."     If the Westra boulders came from Strom
ness, they must have been transported                     about 40 miles           in   a   N. or
N.N.E.     direction, across what now is occupied by several groups of
islands and        deep Bea sounds.
   If,   on the other theory, the boulders of sandstone on the southern
and western shores of Westra came from                        Eda    (as suggested          in the
above passage), they must have been transported                            about 10 to 12
miles     in   a    N.W. direction,       across      what     is now      a     sea sound,     in
some places 25 fathoms deep.

 Sanday, Stromsa, and Shapinshay,                    mention that in these clay beds
there are boulders            smoothed and striated,            most of them "foreign
 to the islands," and         in many    cases, accompanied by            " numerous frag
 ments   of marine shells           ;" — "these      fragments being smoothed and
 striated like the stones in the boulder clay,"               — " characteristics, which
 (they say) there can be no doubt are due to the very same cause in
 both cases" (pp. 656, 657).

 there is a bed of clay, 20 to 30 feet thick, containing granite, gneiss,
 oolite, and chalk flints,    &c, all foreign    to the    island,    besides frag

 The lochs of Stennis and Stanay now occupy it.
    No large boulders     ;  but on north exposures of hills             there are
 small stones strewed over the surface, quite different from               rocks in
 situ.    The former are chiefly white freestone         ;  the rocks     Old Red
 Sandstones or flagstones (Second Report, p. 167).
    Messrs Peach and Home express an opinion                        that all      the
boulders in the Orkneys, as well as in the Shetlands,                were    carried
 or pushed across the islands by a Scandinavian ice sheet                 from the
S.R
    Objections to that theory were suggested           by the      Convener,       in
 articles which   appeared    in the Geological Magazine for            1881, and
 in  an address   by him to the Edinburgh Geological Society in May
1881.
    In addition   to the foregoing notes respecting Orkney boulders,
 it is proper to notice the researches of Messrs Peach and Home.
    In  a paper, published     in the Journal of     the London Geological
Society for November         1880,  it is mentioned, as the result of their
survey, " that    the islands have      been  glaciated in one       determinate
direction, independently of their physical features.            "When we       con
sider that the glaciated surfaces along the cliff tops,          as well as the
roches moutonnees on the hill-slopes, prove that the islands mud              have

of Orkney" (p. 654).
    " From the manner       in which tho rock striatums maintain their
N.W.     bend, irrespective  of  the physical features of the country, it is
evident that the agent which produced them must have acted

about 900 tons (First Report, p. 46).
     The nearest Conglomerate rocks in situ         are W.N.W. from boulder,
and distant about        7 miles.   The boulder in    shape is angular.     It  lies
on gravel        The boulder must have been carried to its site (Estuary

      Dunkeld.   — On Craigiebarns Hill, to N.E of town, mica schist
 boulders, lying chiefly on knolls and other exposed surfaces which
  face    N.W. at   a height  of about 1000 feet above River Tay.
      On this hill, rocks smoothed and striated, by          some agency    which
  evidently    passed over them from       N.N.W.
       The directions of the striae at lower levels correspond more with
  axis of valley, which is about       N.E
      The highest striations      seem   to indicate    an agent which passed

the ridge where these boulders lie there are no granite or porphyry
rocks ; but such rocks do occur to the northward (as in Glen Tilt),
where, therefore, probably            is the source     from, which the boulders
 came (Seventh Report, p. 40).
     On the Perthshire Hills, between              Blair Athole and Dunkeld, Mr
Janiieson found ice-worn suifacee              of-  rock on the tops of hills, at
 elevations of 2200 feet, as        if  caused by ice pressing over them from
 the N.W. ; — and transported boulders, at              even greater heights.
     On the highest        watersheds of the Ochils, at altitudes of about
 2000 feet,     Mr Jamieson found pieces of mica              schist  full of garnets,
 which    seemed to him to have come            from the Grampian Hills to the
 ~N.W.,     showing     that the transporting          agent had      overflowed     the

is common to find          Balani sticking on under surface of tk»
boulders.        Suggested in explanation, that after Balani had grows
on boulders, the boulders                 were       floated away by ice, and                       dropped
on    mud where now found.                         Mr Jamieson adds                  that      "I        some

Convener along coast to north of the Gairloch Hotel, and at all
heights up to the very summits of the hills, reaching to nearly
1 000 feet above sea.        The late Professor Nicol's description of these
boulders is not inappropriate, when he says that these              "hills  about
Loch Maree and Gairloch           are strewed     with innumerable fragments
of   red sandstone,     perched, like sentinels, in the most exposed and
perilous positions, on the very         edge  of   some   lofty cliff, or on the
polished summit of domes of gneiss."             These red sandstone boulders
belong mostly to what has been termed the Cambrian                     formation,
reddish-brown      sandstone rocks, which exist along the coast towards
the north, and partially also in tho east coast of the Lewis.                 The
rocks of the Gairloch       Hills  are generally gneiss.
    Lithograph No. 40 (Plate X.) represents              a  granite boulder     on
 the edge of    a high sea-cliff facing the west, 7 47 feet above the sea,
 projecting    2£ feet beyond the edge of the cliff ; having apparently
 been lodged there by some agent wliich, striking upon the cliff,
 caused the boulder to slide off upon the cliff.
    Lithograph No.       41   (Plate X.) represents one of the hills on the
 coast,  to the north of the Gairloch Hotel, 585 feet above the sea, with
 two boulders on the west side of its summit.                 The Convener, on
 ascending the      hill to examine the boulders, found that the large
 boulder was 7 feet long by 3 J feet high, and that it projected 2 feet
 beyond the edge of the cliff. As the rock on which it rests slopes
 down towards      N.W. at     an angle of 15°, the Convener thought there
 would not be much difficulty, by means of a crowbar, in projecting
 it over the cliff altogether.
     Lithograph No.      42  (Plate X.) shows the foregoing boulder, with
  the rock it rests on,  on a larger scale. This boulder is a blue whinstone,
  the small boulder     a red  sandstone, and the rock of the      hill clay slate.
     Lithograph No.      43  (Plate X.) shows a rocky knoll, near the base
  of the same    hill, on which a number of true erratics are clustered.
  The uppermost of these         (6x5x3     feet) rests on the others, in such
  a position as to show that it had come from the N.W.
     On the hills between Gairloch and Loch Fionn, the position of
  the smoothed rocks, and also of boulders,              seemed    to indicate    a
  movement rather from          W.S.W. than from the usual direction             of
  N.W.     The deflection, the Convener          thought, could be accounted
  for by a range of hills there, against which the transporting              agent
   may have struck      {Fifth Report,   p. 56).

   On another hill near the hotel, about 900 feet                       above the       sea,  i
well-rounded boulder was found, very near the top, on its                        west side,

15    feet    in girth      of grey granite, on        a   gravel terrace,        610     feet
above sea.         Locality interesting, on account of the immense beds
of gravel and sand which have been formed here — no doubt
by the agency of the             sea ;   and probably        flattened      by lacustrine
waters, of which Loch Rosque is               a  remnant.

" Loch      Mvllardoch the slope was at an angle of 47".                                 At
height of 1530          feet there    rests   on this slope a boulder 12x8x7
feet,   of     hard quartzy       gneiss,     which    he    says    mitd     have     been
brought     there," as it differs from the rock of the hill (Ninth                  Report,

   Ben      Wyvis (3426 feet), near Dingwall.— Its N.W. shoulder                        pre
sents    whole acres of rock swept bare of soil, with rounded                           and
polished       boulders      of a   peculiar veined granite,           identified     with
rocks to the          westward, in the         tract called Dirriemore.              These
boulders are found half way up Hen Wyvis.                           Similar      boulders
occur,    strewed        over the country          both north                  and    Ault

Grand), and south (Strathgarve)                 of Ben Wyvis.          In    Stratbgarve
some of the boulders are as large as cottages                (First  Report,     p. 48).
   Dirriemore. — Mr           Jolly of Inverness          states   that the peculiar
granite of this district          has been       carried   "  eastward," none of it
"westward."          It   has been carried across        the Cromarty Firth,           and
scattered     in  large    masses even over the Black Isle.              It  is plentiful
over the " Laigh of Moray " and along the                         sea-shore,     between
Burghead and Lossiemouth (Sixth Report, p. 47).
   Mr Wallace of Inverness also reports having                       seen Dirriemore

  Edderton (west of Tain). — Three large boulders of grey granite
pointed out to Convener at about 1000 feet above sea, on side of
hills sloping down towards N.N.W.     Rocks on which they rest are
Old Red. A horizontal terrace is site of one. The idea that they
came       from          "Cairn    nu    Cunneig"         (Hill of Pitcher),          situated     12
miles          to    N.W.    (as   suggested       by Rev.       Mr Joass of Golspie),             is
disputed, as rocks there are stated to be                         a   red granite.         Another
idea is that they came from hills near Rogart, 10 or 12 miles to N.
or         by E., as rocks there said                to- be   grey granite         (First Report,
p. 49, and Second Report,                 p. 175).
  Fannich Mountains (situated west of Ben Wyvis). — Mr J. F.
Campbell (Islay) wrote to Convener that on these hills, 2700 feet
above sea, there is a boulder of grey gneiss with garnets. Its local
name is             " Glach Mhor na Biachdoil."                  It   is 30 x 10 x     3 feet,   and
there is a train of large boulders to be seen in a valley not far off.
Rocks smoothed and striated.                         Direction of        strice,    parallel with
valleys   (First Report, p; 49).

     Dingwall. — Mr Morrison, teacher in the Academy, and Secretary

   On the south slope of Tulloch Hill there are three boulders of                                   a
pinkish granite, of the following dimensions — 11 x x feet, major :           7      7

this last-mentioned boulder there are ruts and striae running X.W.,
and about thirty-six artificial cup-markings.
   On Drynie Farm, S.VV. of last mentioned                   boulder, at 610          fee:
above sea, a mica schist boulder           12x8x4      feet, major axis N.X.W.
On its surface six striations, running N. and S., with one                  cup-mark
at south end.
   On Tulloch       Hill, another pinkish-coloured granite boulder            900    feet
above    sea,   8x6x4       feet,   with major axis      N.W.       The prevailing
rock on Tulloch        Hill  is bluish-grey indurated sandstone slate.
   Where strata crop out on opposite side of valley their                edges have
been rubbed and smoothed              on their north faces by some             natural
agency moving in a direction from            N.W.
   On north slope of Tulloch            Hill a moor stretches up to height of
about 1100 feet, on which            many small boulders         of  same    kind     as
above,  — and     to be found also all the way down to Cromarty                Firth.
   Mr Morrison        set out on an excursion        to west, with the idea of
discovering the direction          from which      these   Tulloch    boulders    had
come.      At Ach-na-Clerach         he  found "   a gigantic     mass of the   same
kind of granite        as the boulders,      25 x 23 x 12 feet,— the rock           on
which it was resting being different from that of the boulders.
   At   the confluence      of the rivers Gtascarnoch and Strathcaick               he
found     rock   of the same variety        as the Tulloch boulders,       but at a
lower level than Tulloch           HilL    He inferred that       the boulders had
been carried eastwards           over the south shoulder of Little           Wyvis,
and that " they probably came from Carn-Cuineag through                   the open
ing occupied by Loch Glass."
   Mr Morrison,        accompanied      by some geological friends,      proceeded
next to Cairn Cuimeag,           27 44 feet above sea.       It is the highest hill
                                                                                    of
in Easter      Ross.     Its two    peaks, or   Pitcher   lugg, are pinnacles
granite.      Its   slopes    are  covered   by enormous        masses  of   granite
semi-cubical in shape.            An opinion    was formed that most of           the
boulders in Easter Ross had been derived from this                  mountain, and
its lesser neighbours Cam-Maine,            and Cam an Lochan.
                                                                                     ;
   The saddle between the two peaks appears                like  a shingly beach
— rounded      stones    of about 10 pounds weight are packed             here and

     Caiileton.  — Many blocks of granite
                                               (red and grey varieties) lie on
greywacke and Carboniferous rocks, — which apparently came from
Dumfries and Kirkcudbright shires, 30 to             40 miles distant, crossing
Esk and other rivers (Sixth Report, p.          28).
     Hounded      boulders of grey granite occur on the fields and moors
near Castleton Manse, where Convener saw several from                3  to  4 feet
 in diameter.       On   east bank of  River Esk, about     2 miles below Lang
 holm, Convener saw granite boulders — both red and grey varieties —
 some of them very large.           A  number occur also in the       Gill burn,
 which flows into the Liddell             above its junction with the Esk.
 These granite blocks lie on the greywacke strata, as well as on the
 coal measures.         The nearest known     hill of granite is Criffel, which
 consists     almost entirely    of grey granite, situated about 20 miles
 W.S.W. from        these boulders.      The next nearest place where granite
 rocks occur is in Ayrshire, at Loch Doime, bearing about W. by N.
from the boulders.
     In   a small stream north      of Tofts House, and about three quarters
 of  a mile east of Edgerstone, there were seen            by Convener     several
 angular blocks of greywacke, resting on           a   purplish porphyry rock.
 The nearest point where there are           greywacke rocks in situ is about
 half a mile to west, between which, however, and these blocks, there
 is a porphyry hill several hundred feet high. There is no greywacke
 to the south or east ("Geological Account of Roxburghshire,"               Trans.
 Edin. Roy. Soc, vol. xv.         p. 412).
     In   this parish there is a remarkable         kaim, composed      partly of
 gravel, partly of sand, in horizontal beds.           It runs for about half     a
  mile  ;  is about 200 feet wide at base, and from 50 to 60 feet high.
 In   the gravel there are blocks and pebbles of granite (both red and
 grey), as well as fragments of shale and coal, — derived, no doubt,
  from rocks to the westward.             The kaim forms nearly        a straight
  line, the direction of which is        N.E  by  E. (Trans. Edin. Roy. Soc,
  voL xv.    p. 463).
     Another long ridge of sand occurs near Eckford, on the River
  Cayle, running       E.N.E.

     Fovla Island. — Situated about 20 miles from nearest other
island, and with a sound between, of 50 fathoms in depth (Second
Report, p. 177).
     On this island, which has on it a hill reaching to a height of
1370 feet, several boulders were reported to the Committee.
     The Eev. James Russell, in 1873 (who was then resident in
Walls), visited the island, and refers to several boulders — situated in
the south half of the island, — the north half he had not examined.
     From the middle of the island, to south end, he reported drift              as
high up     as 700 feet, containing      much granite and gneiss, which he
supposed to have          come    from Mainland.         In the middle of the
island there       are  two boulders      of irregular   shape,  each     weighing
ahout     2 tons, — their  composition he does not mention.
     Mr Eussell     stated that at the south end of the island            there are
 three boulders of gneiss and two boulders of granite,            each weighing
 from    3 to 5 cwt., and     which   he supposed came       from the Culswick
 and Delting Hills on Mainland, towards the N.E-.
      Messrs   Peach and Home, on the other hand, suggest               that these
 boulders     may belong to rocks in situ on Foula itself, inasmuch              as
 the   eastern part of the island (they say) consists of gneissose           rocks,
  with   a mass of granite    in the N.E. corner (Geol. Mag. for August
  1881, p. 372).
      Messrs Peach and Home, however, mention that they discovered
  in the boulder clay of Foula a block of epidotic syenite from Dun-
  rossness ; — a locality which bears S.E. from Foulat separated by sea
  at least 50 miles in breadth, and having         a depth of 70 fathoms.
      Houssay    Island. — On    a  cliff 200 feet above     sea there are loose
  blocks resting on rounded and polished             rocky knolls    ;  the knolls
  having been evidently polished before receiving the boulders               (First
  Report, p. 43).
      Papa Stour Island      was visited by the late    Dr Hibbert in the year
   1822  (Edin. Journ.    Science for 1831,   vol iv.  p. 86).   He found in it
  several peculiar schists, foreign to the island, apparently derived from
   rocks at   Hilswick Ness, situated to the N.E., and distant about             12
   miles across   St Magnus Bay, which has        a depth   of 40 fathoms.
      This island was visited also by Professor Geikie, who states that
   he found on     it many " transported        blocks of gneiss,      schist, and
                                           "

St Magnus Bay.
   Dr Hibbert              refers to a transported boulder                      on the summit of                   this

 above     sea    1 00   to  1 20 feet.     The Professor, from the account given to
 him of them,           thought the stones had probably been "carried,"               — there
 being no land near them                  at a higher level (Second Report, p. 193).

  Fair Isle Parish. — Rev. Mr Laurence,                               catechist,   reported           tlar
there are no boulders above 10 tons, but that there are several Mali
boulders        of Conglomerate quite differing                      from any rocks in islaoj
(Eighth Report,           p. 7).
   He adds that there was one large block of sandstone which                                          was
blown up in 1880. It differed from any rocks in island, and                                           was
similar to the Eday sandstone.

Murchison, examined this most northern isle of the Shetland*,                                        and
gave   in   a   Report to the British Association                      in the year       1   864.     He
stated that he "ascended                  the Muckle Heog                 Hill, reaching            to      a

polished to the depth of at least 150 feet."                           Professor    Geikie in            an
article in Nature, of 17th September 1877, refers to the forepart;

   In addition to the information                         in the foregoing      notes, regarding
boulders,it is right to refer to the information given by Messn
Peach and Home (in their paper on the Shetland?) regarding ti»

       " For     these various reasons, we are justified in inferring that the

 Stone," about 70 feet above           sea.     Longer axis N. and      S.    Assuming
  boulder to have come through valley or kyle, between Abbot's
  Craig and Damyat, it must have travelled in a direction from N.W.

       2. Kilsyth and Strathblane. — Mr Jack, of Scotch Government
  Geological Survey, reported two boulders, — one of mica slate, weigh
  ing      about    6  tons, 1260 feet above sea, its parent rock supposed
  by him to         be to the    N., and distant      15 miles.      The other boulder
   is Conglomerate,         8x4x3      feet, its longer axis being          W.   20°  N.,
   its parent rock supposed by him             to. be also to   N.W. (First Report,
   p. 51).
        3. Campsie. — Mr       John Young of      the Hunterian Museum, Glasgow,
   accompanied Convener to an inspection of the district near Campsie,
    and pointed out the following objects of interest :— (1) On Craigend
    Moor, about 450 feet above              sea, sandstone rock        presented great
    sheets     of smoothed surface, evidently           ground down       by severe    or
    long-continued       friction,  with occasional      stride  running S.E. by       S.
    In    some places there were quartz pebbles              in the sandstone rock,
    which were ground down, showing marks of rubbing chiefly on the
    N.W. sides.
        At four other places there were striatums on rocks, pointing                  re
     spectively S.E. by S. and S.E. £ S., S.E. by S., S.S.E.
        Looking from this moor towards the N.W., hills are seen about a
     1000 feet high, at one place      with    an opening between them of about
     11 miles     in width, through which, if there          was   a  current, it might
     pass   over Craigend Moor.

872                 Proceedings    of the Royal   Society
   Several boulders were pointed out.        Two were of a species of tap
common in the Kilpatrick         Hills, situated some miles to 'W.X.W.
Another boulder was      a grey granite, which, judging from the sat of
its felspar crystals,  Mr Young supposed might have come from Bra
Awe,    a mountain    situated to N."W.,     and distant  about 30 mika.
There were also several Conglomerate           boulders, derived probabij
from the belt of that rock, which, running from Dumbarton, emmet
Loch Lomond in      a  N.E. direction towards Aberfoyle.
   The Convener at another time, when on Campsie Hills, fowai
rocks at 800 feet above the sea, striated in a direction E. and W.
 On the   Kilsyth Hills,   a few miles further east, the rock strut point
the same way.
   On Croy    Hill, a knoll of trap rock, being the summit leTel   betweea
the Firths of Clyde and Forth, about 160 feet above the sea, tier*
is an immense accumulation of boulders.          Some of the boulders   are
of old Conglomerate,       which must have      come   from  the westward
and stuck on the knoll (Fourth Report, p. 42).
   The relative positions of these localities may be more readfly
 understood, by referring to the annexed map.

    6.  Stirling and Doune districts. — Conglomerate boulders occur at
the following localities (Sixth Report, p. 31) : —
    (1) At Kilbride, boulder of about 900 tons (mentioned                   under
Perthshire).
    (2) On Landrick Estate, boulder of about 360 tons.
    (3) At Keltie Bridge, boulder weighing about 60 tons.
    (4) On Gartincaber, boulder weighing about 16 tons.
    (5) On North side of River Teith, boulder weighing about 13 tons.
    (6) In the    Bum of Campsie, two boulders        each weighing about      13
and 24 tons.
    (7) In the district traversed by the      hill road between Doune and
 Callander, multitudes of smaller size.
    (8) At Cornton Brickwork (between Stirling and Bridge of Allan),
small boulder found in bed of clay.
    (9) On the rocks adjoining Stirling Castle on the north, small
Conglomerate boulders, besides others of gneiss and greywacke.
    (10)   At  Loch    Coulter and Gillies   Hill    (places 3 miles south of
Stirling), several Conglomerate boulders, besides others of mica slate
and felspar porphyry.
    (11) On Plean Estate (4 miles       S.E   of Stirling), boulders of Con
glomerate, gneiss, granite, greywacke, and whinstone.
    (12)   At Glenbervie, near Torwood (5 miles S.S.E of Stirling),              a
Conglomerate boulder, 6 feet square, found by Convener.
     (13) On Dunmore Estate (9 miles S.E. of Stirling), a Conglomerate
boulder of about 10 tons, found by Convener.
    A   more    particular  account  of  the foregoing        boulders    may be
 found in " The Estuary of the Forth"*         p. 41, where      it will  be seen,
 that all   those  which    are elongated  in  shape,    generally     have their
longer axis in a direction      N.W. and S.E.
    There can be no doubt that all these boulders had been carried
from hills situated to the N.W., near Callander                 and Aberfoyle,
 as there are rocks there of the     kind composing the boulders, and in
no nearer district.
     On the north side of Stirling Castle the trap rocks            are traversed
 by narrow     gorges,  running about   E   and   W., the sides of which in
 many places      present smoothings and striae, especially on the south
 sides, indicating transport from     a point  a  little  to the north    of west.

   The striaj are generally horizontal,                        but occasionally         are incluwl
slightly upwards towards the east.
   A    few small           boulders, well rounded,                  occur    in   several of tie
gorges.       Among them, granites and conglomerates were                                 observed.
   Craigforth          Hill, about     2   miles west of Stirling, has              smoothing?             on
its rocks near the top (198 feet above sea), and a few striae running
in a N.W. and S.E. direction. The Convener found on it also small
boulders, apparently from rocks situated at or near Aberfuyle,                                       which
bears    W.    J     N. from Craigforth.
   On or near the Racecourse                  at    Stirling (situated S.W.                    from      the
Castle), about 130 to 160 feet above                             the sea,       there     are several
granite boulders lying on smoothed sandstone rocks.                                  The largest           is
7x3x4         feet.      It   is on a rocky        kn<   ii,   the smoothest part              of   which
slopes down towards              N.N.W.       As the boulder, from its composition,
most     probably came from the               hills situated to. the N.W.,     must             it
have lodged on what would be the lee side                            of the knoll.
   7.   Aberfoyle. — Arndruni Hill, reaching to height of                           454 feet        above
sea,    forms part of the ridge of Conglomerate rock, which                                     traverses
country in       a   N.E. and S.W. direction by Callander and                       Loch Lomond.
On this ridge Professor Heddle, at                   a    height of 230         feet, found         a   line
of six boulders of angular gneiss, stretching N. and                                S.         They     are
from    2   to     20 feet      apart, and are from, tliree-quarters                      to    3   cubic
yards in size.
   To the west of this line, four other similar boulders lay                                   along the
summit        of the ridge, and thus at right                        angles to      the        first line

    West and North Coasts, — The late Robert Chambers visited the
west     coast    of Sutherland, travelling      round    by Cape Wrath, and
along the north          coast  as  far  as Tongue     Bay, with the following
results    : —
    1.  At    a height     of 1700 and 1800 feet, he found            striae on the
rocks of Cuineag and Canish (quartz hills in Assynt, about 30 miles
north of Gairloch), running from about N. 60° W. with certain
exceptions          One of these      exceptions was at the base of Cuineag,
where the streaks are from the direct north, apparently by reason of
a turn or deflection which the agent had there received at and
by reason of the base of an adjoining hill. Another exception was
at the hollow dividing the              mass    of the hill from         its  loftiest
top,   where       another   system of streaking        had    come   in from the
direct    west.
    2.   On   a  summit south from Ben More, fully 1500 feet high and
4 or 5 miles to the south of Cuineag, there are streakings on the
quartz, observing the normal            direction   of this general movement,
viz., from N.       60°  W;
    3.  On the gneissic platform          between Coul More and Sulvean             Dr
Chambers         found    polished   surfaces striated from      N.W. and from
W.      To the west and north of the latter mountain                 are markings
in all    respects     similar.    These are situations,      observes Chambers,
where no local glaciers could exist.
    4. Streakings precisely the same as those on Cuineag and Canish
exist at an elevation of at least 2000 feet on the similar quartz
mountain called Ben Eay,            Bouth  of Loch Maree, and       40 miles from
Assynt ; — this striation being from N.W. or thereabouts, and totally
irrespective of the form of the hill.
    5. Passing northward        to Rhiconish,
                                                 " we find near that place striw
coming in from the coast, viz., from the N.W., and passing across a
high moor, with no regard whatever to the inequalities of the
 ground."
    6.  A little     farther north, at Laxford,       a  fine surface is marked
 with striations from the N.W.,            being  across   the valley   in which is

  876                    Proceedings    of the Royal Society
  occurs.      At  an opening    in the bold "gneissic      coast,   which looks      emt
  upon the Peiitland        Firth, there is strong marking in         a direction fp-ia
  N.N.W.         The high desolate tract between Loch Eribol and Tongue
  Bay, where there is nothing that could restrain or guide the jwf*-
  ment     of   the ice,   exhibits striations     from N.      28°    W.      Stri* is
  nearly the same direction, viz., N. 25°           W., occur    i miles     to the  e«s*
  of Tongue.        On perfectly free ground, at Armadale, the markings
  point almost directly from the north.           When we pass on to Caithsat
  we find traces     of striation, still from points between N. and N.W„
  which is directly transverse to          a line pointing     to the neighbouring
 hills" (Fifth Report,        p. 62).
     The late Professor Nicol        observes that,
                                                      " on the whole X. W.         coast,
                                                                    '
 from Cape "Wrath southwards, numerous ' perched                       boulders    occur
 on summits and sides of hills, in most exposed situations.                    They   are
 especially numerous around Loch Maree" (First Report, p. 51).
     In another paper (Brit. Assoc. Reports for 1855, p. 89) the Pro
  fessor   states   that   "on the west       coast   of Sutherland,        near Loch
 Laxford, enormous blocks           are perched on the top       of rounded      bosses,
 or on the very verge of precipices.             As the slightest impulse         seems
 sufficient to dislodge these boulders, the manner in which they were
 placed in their present positions is very problematical."
     It  is matter of regret that no reports came to the Committee re
 garding the boulders on the           N.W. and If.     coasts  of Sutherlandshire,
 though frequent applications            for them were made.             For want of
  reports    it has been thought right to refer to the foregoing observa
 tions by Dr Chambers and Professor Nicol.

                       of Edinburgh,        Session 1883-84.                        877
    Glenluce. — The        Rev.   Mr Wilson reports the finding of water-
worn nodules of flints in          beds   of stratified drifts, at different places
along the     coast  for about      6 miles.     Various localities named, where
flints were found by Mr Wilson in drift beds up to 200                 feet above sea.
He     suggests    that some of the drift materials              probably came from
Arran, and the flints from Armagh in Ireland (Ninth Report,                      p. 26).
                                    Fabc)e Islands.
    Though     these islands form       no part of Scottish territory, they are
not    so far from      the Hebrides,       Orkney,      and Shetlands,      as not to
warrant     some notice      of their glacial phenomena.            Moreover, having
been visited by several Scotch geologists, who reported on them to
the Edinburgh Royal Society, it may               be allowable to add a few notes
bearing on the boulders and rock striations of these islands
                                      1 Erratics.
    1.   The first traveller who noticed the glacial phenomena of the
Faroes was the Rev. G. Landt, a Danish clergyman, whose book was
translated into English in 1810.
    In   page 8   of his treatise he     says  : —
    " There    are sometimes to be seen            in the valley tt single     stones, 6,
8, or 10 feet     in diameter, in places         where    it is impossible   they could
have fallen down from the hills.                Such- stones are found also here
and there, at a considerable height on the hills, where there is no
other eminence in the neighbourhood,                 from which they might have
rolled down."         He    adds,   a little farther on, that      these

Faroe Islands,        lately published       in the Edinburgh Royal Society
 Transactions,      vol. xxx.    p. 250, says, under the head of         Erratics, that
" large angular         blocks    of basalt rock       are   of common occurrence.
Near Thorshavn,           many are       of large     size,   measuring occasionally
 upwards      of 20 feet across.         They occupy positions which preclude
the possibility of        then*  having fallen or rolled down the hills ; and

    In   the year 1855 the late       Kobort Chambers, also         a Fellow of the
Royal Society, who had previously paid much attention to glacial
phenomena,       visited the Faroes, and wrote an interesting account of
¦what    he saw.       He explains, that being aware of Mr Allan's dis
covery at Eide, he went there on purpose to study the markings on
the rocks. The following is his description : — " There are some
small fields under cultivation.              Every here and there the rocks
are presented on the surface, where they            are  invariably    seen rounded
or flattened, with peculiar           deep   channelings,      precisely like those
rocks which       are now generally        believed to have been abraded by
ice.      My attention        being   arrested by     these     features,   I  looked
narrowly for the         striae or scratches    which ice generally        leaves  on
surfaces     over which        it has   passed.    They presented themselves
in    abundance,      in several     places,   most strikingly       of all, within
sea-mark on the shore of the quiet bay, being                     all directed from
 the north, which is also the direction             of the canaux or channel
ings,    and further      of the passage or isthmus in which the village
 (of Eide) lies."
     In his Memoir       on the    Faroe Islands, Dr James Geikie (p. 246)
 referring to the same       locality of Eide, says, that " perhaps the best
 preserved roches moutonnees          we anywhere observed were in Osteroe
and Sandoe.         It  was with considerable interest that we visited the
 northern portion       of the former island, for we felt that the evidence
 to be gathered there would go a long way to settle the question
 which we had come to solve. No difficulty was experienced in
 finding the locality described           so  long ago by Allan, and subse
 quently visited        by Chambers         but the    striae,   instead    of being
 ' directed          the north,'    had clearly been graved by ice coming
             from
from quite     the opposite     point cf  the compass.      The Kodlen peninsula
 we found glaciated all over, the roches           moutonnees      on both sides of
 the isthmus being beautifully perfect, and showing                  Stogs and Lee-
 seiten  in the most admirable manner.            In   many places the striae are
 well   seen, and long ruts and channelings,          or grooves and trenches,
 well smoothed and ice-worn, traverse the rock surface.                   We traced
  the glaciated contour up to a height of 1302 feet, which was the
 summit level of the pass leading from Eide to Funding                     ;  but the

880                           Proceedings        of   the   Royal Society
slopes facing the sound between Osteroe and Stromoe seemed to                                         'v.

upon those slopes, so far as we                    could observe them, seemed to be :i
a   direction          corresponding           with the trend of the sound,                   namely,
from 8.8.E. to               N.N.W."
    As any        facts bearing on the smoothed and striated                          rocks at    Eids
and the Kodlen peninsula deserve attention, the following                                        addi
tional paragraphs in Professor Geikie's Memoir are quoted                                 : —
    On page 254 he states                  that " the soundings on the chart                    prove,
that the long fiord which separates                         Stromoe from Osteroe occupie-
the bed       of two submerged                 valleys, with        a    low separating col,         over
which there            is    shallow water.        This     col occurs     in the narrow       part    of
the sound between Nordskaale                       and Ore      ;   and the soundings            show
that from this point the water deepens, both towards                                N.W. and S.E
The fiord      is      shallower at its mouth near Eide, where there                           are    5}
and     9   fathoms of water, than                it   is   at and above         Haldervig,     where
we get depths of 18 to 30 fathoms."
    On page 261 Professor Geikie                       states   that " the long sound that
separates Osteroe               from Stromoe brimmed with ice, which flowed in
two directions.                North of Nordskaale the movement                     was northerly      ;
while south of the shallow part of that sound the ice held on                                          a
southerly course."
    A   point, apparently of some importance,                             is   brought out in Dr
Geikie's Memoir, viz., that many of the hills show smoothing                                           of
rocks, only up to              a     certain height.
    Thus     it   is   stated that      " the lower part of the mountains that over
look Kolfaredel               are    smoothed and abraded in     S.E. direction, and
                                                                           a
we estimated             tho height reached            by the glacial outline to be some
1500 or 1600 feet,                    Above that level all          rough and rugged, and
                                                                    is
destitute of the slightest trace of glacial                     abrasion "      (p. 245).
    Then, on an adjoining mountain, where there                            is  a   pass at 1243 feet
above the sea, there are                  "   roches moutonneet,"          but we saw no        stria1.
Tho glaciated outline was continued up the mountain slopes above
                               "
us, for not less than 400 feet   (p. 245).
    In another locality, " the                 col, we found to be 1693 feet above the
sea, and      the glaciation             came close up to this leveL                  But   abraded
rocks with the characteristic glaciated contour certainly                                   reached
1600 feet"             (p.   246).

     At   p.  246 it is mentioned       that   "the upper parts of the hills
between Fundingsfiord and Andafiord were above the limits of gla-
ciation."    ..."     Suderbe has supported a considerable mass of ice ;
for we traced the glaciated outline up to                a height      of 1040 feet.
Above that level all is rough, angular, and serrated             "

     The explanation     suggested    by Dr Geikie of      these interesting facts
is, that " when the islands were enveloped in their ice-sheet, the
action of frost would be confined to such ridges and hill tops as pro
jected above the mer         de glace,  while   severe   glacial abrasion would

     Dr Geikie, in his Memoir,          more than     once   takes notice of the
 " scarcity    of moraine mounds" which, he says,

Summary       of Facts contained in the Nine Annual Eeports op
        the Committee, and op Inferences apparently deducible
        from these Facts, bearing on the Question, by what
        Agency Boulders were transported to their present
        Sites.
                   I. Distribution of Boulders in Scotland.
    It  might be possible to extract from the Eeports, approximately,
the numbers of boulders        in each  county, so far as made known to
the Committee.        But  these  numbers would give      a  very incorrect
idea of either the prevalence        or the paucity,    originally,  of the
boulders in different parts of Scotland, — first,    because counties vary
extremely in size ; second, because      from some counties the informa
 tion sent was more copious than from others ; third, because in some
counties,    where agricultural     improvements    have been     extensive,
boulders in thousands have long ago disappeared by wholesale ex
tirpation.
    In   the absenoe   of precise statistics, it may  be stated generally,
that there is no Scotch county where boulders do not exist, and
that on all the islands, including the Hebrides, Orkney, Shetlands,
and the Faroes, boulders are found.
    If,  however, an opinion on this point is of any value, the Convener
may say, that having      visited   two-thirds of the Scotch counties, to
inspect and search for boulders, he considers that they are in much
larger numbers on the West Coast, and the hills adjoining the West
Coast,    than on any other district of the same extent.

                     II.   Size or Weights      of Boulders.
   It will   be seen     from    the Abstract,       and   still more from the
Annual Reports, that the dimensions of the boulders, when of con
siderable size, are in most cases there given.             But in this Summary,
it may  be sufficient to refer to cases        of boulders    made   known to the
Committee exceeding 100 tons in weight.
   The element of large      size or weight has some bearing on the ques
tion, What could be the agency by which boulders were transported f
especially  if it appears that many were transported              great distances,
and across    valleys    and    hill   ranges,   as  to fulfil   these  conditions
the transporting     agent would require to be of peculiar power               and
magnitude.

                            III.    Shapes     of Boulders.
   Two     classes may be specified —(1) angular and rough,               (2) rounded
and smooth, on the surface.
    In all the Scotch counties, both of             these classes   exist; — with this
distinction,     that the second class are            generally embedded in drift,
whilst the first       are mostly,     at all events, now, on the surface of
the district (Abstract, pp. 849, 850).
    If, aa may be assumed, the erratic blocks referred to                in the Com
mittee's Reports were originally fragments                  from rocks in situ, then
it is probable that the most rounded             are those    which have undergone
most " wear and tear by transportation.
                            "
    Boulders      of both   classes,    have often a long and a short axis            ;
                                                                                        —
smooth boulders more            frequently      so, than others.       The latter     are
also frequently
                     " Pear-shapeti," indicating that          one end has probably
undergone more friction than the opposite end.                   Bee, as an example,
" Dana boulder," on         p. 781     of Abstract
    In such     cases   it has    also been observed that when one end is
smooth and sharp-pointed, the opposite end is generally square or
rough.
                    IV. Particular Markings             on Boulders.
    On some Boulders           there    arc    occasionally     grooves, ruts, strue,
and scratches upon their surface when smooth.
    The incisions generally form lines approximately parallel with th«
longer axis of the boulder.            They may occur on          one or more     of the
sides, i.e., along the upper, lateral, and under surfaces.
    Examples of marks on the under surface                will be seen by referring     to
the Abstract, p. 769 (Aberdeen);             p. 808    (Iona)  ; p. 845 (TyneeasUe) ;
and p. 847 (Alnwick         Hill).
    It  has    been   thought,      that   from      a  close   examination     of ruts
and     striae,   whether    on boulders         or on rocks,       the   direction     of
the striating       agent can be inferred              by observing     at which     end
the striae have been most deeply                   cut      In  multitudes     of   cases
it has been observed, that the                striae are more deeply cut at one
end, whilst towards the other end they gradually                      thin away and
disappear.        In explanation of this fact, it is            suggested    that hard
pebbles or stones, acting as incising tools, would, in advancing al^n:

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                             880
the surface of the boulder or the rock,           become blunted       under severe
pressure, and be at length crushed to pieces.
    In   the Tynecastle boulder, striae were seen on both the upper and
the under surface.          Those on the upper surface showed incision
from     a westerly  point  ;   those on the under surface, showed incision
from an easterly point, judging by the              test before referred to.        If
the boulder had been pushed over sharp rocks from the westward,
the ruts on the lower surface would, according to that                    test, show
that     they had begun to be formed at the east end.                     After the
boulder had      become fixed       in position,  a  drift of hard shingle       pass
ing over the top from the west would produce                  stria? beginning      at
the   west end.
    It  is evident that striae could be formed less easily on the vertical
or lateral sides of      a boulder     than on the upper or under sides, as
the incising pebbles might not, in the first          case, so easily continue to
move in      a horizontal     direction.    One boulder is mentioned where
striae    were seen on both sides of the boulder            — these sides       meet
ing    at, and radiating      from,   a point   at one end, as shown in the
woodcut on p. 802 of Abstract.             The case is interesting on account
of its bearing on the          agency   which produced the        striae, as  it must
have been       such as to        be capable    of being     separated     into two
currents      when    it reached the boulder, in which              case a current
 would flow along         each    side,  pushing    and pressing drift        on the
surface of the boulder as it passed.
    It  is proper also to notice, as bearing on the same question, that
boulders sometimes show two sets of striae, the one set crossing the
other obliquely, indicating a change in the direction of the striating
 agent, or else    in the position of the boulder.        The  case,   for example,
 on page 844 of Abstract, shows one set of striae running                   N.N.W.,
 and the other W. by S. (Easter Duddingstone).
    As the study of striatums may throw light on the nature of the
 transporting     agent,  it is right to take notice of striations on solid
 rocks   ; for if there   are on them two sets of striations           crossing one
 another, the cause must be ascribed either to a change of direction
 in the movement of the striating agent, or to the advent of another
 striating agent from a different quarter.
    Examples of two sets of stria; on a rock surface               will   be seen   in
 Abstract, p. 839 (Glasgow) and p. 849 (Carden               Hill).

890                  Proceedings     of tJie Royal Society
   That the striations on rocks were produced by an agent, the                 sane
as, or similar to, that    which   caused   striation on boulders, is       evident
from the multitudes of cases where there are striated boulders                    an<l
striated rocks     close   to or near one another,           the  direction      and
appearance    of the strioe on both being generally the same.
   Great numbers of rock striations occur in the Hebrides,                  most of
which   are described    in the Fifth Report. Thus (at p. 816) an account
is given of smoothed rocks at Jocdar, on which there are twelve or
fourteen deep ruts, some of them 4 or 5 feet in length. One
measures    8 inches across and 2 inches       in depth, and there are others
of similar width and       depth, — the   ruts being in all cases deeper and
wider at their west than at their east ends.          In  the Letcis, at  Uig    and
 Carlowrie   (Abstract,     p. 819), similar     cases    occur;  also   KHmory
(Abstract, p. 780), Buteshire (Abstract, p. 791).
   These rock striations are found not only on surfaces more or                  less
horizontal, but also on surfaces which slope, and even on                 surfaces
which   are vertical.
   As examples take the two following           cases  :—
   1.  In Bute, there is a rocky defile, about 30 yards wide, at Ban**
Hill  (Abstract, p. 793), through which boulders and drift materials
have evidently passed.         One side of this defile presents extensive
smoothings, on which there are ruts, some of them 12 feet in length,
and more deeply cut into the rock, at the end where the etriating
agent entered the gorge, viz., the N."W.           The direction of movement
is farther shown by the fact, that from that end the ruts                     slope
upwards at angles of from 20° to 30°, the result, no doubt, of the
force with which the materials were pushed or driven through                     the
gorge (Seventh    Report, p. 19).
   2.  Another example occurs on the west side of Arthur's                    Seat,
Edinburgh,     as explained      in Abstract,   p. 843.     Boulders and      other
drift materials     had    passed   through     this    gorge,   which    is   only
about 10 yards wide.         A  boulder sticking on one of the sides            was
striated on its exposed side.        One of the rocky sides also        presented
numerous striations,      — some of   them 6 feet in length, and           J of    an
inch  deep.    At the narrowest part of the defile, where            there would
be the greatest     difficulty in forcing     a passage, the striae are rising
up at an angle of 4" or 5° from the end where the materials                     had
entered the defile.

      Explained under the following heads : —
      1. In    beds  of clay, gravel, and     sand.
      2. On the surface      of the country.
           a.    Lying on flattest   side.

           d. Keating on steep slopes          of hills.
           e.    Eesting on ridges and tops of very high hills.
                     1.   Embedded in Clay, Gravel, or Sand.
     In   Aberdeenshire a boulder of 8 tons found in a bed of sand
 {Abstract, p. 769).
     In Ayrshire,       large boulders     found in a bed of sandy mud at        a
 depth     of   18   feet, the boulders      being    covered •with  Balani and
 Serpidce (Abstract, p. 786 (3)).
     In Renfrewshire, near Paisley, boulders in clay beds, found with
 Balani, which had grown on them (Abstract, p. 860).
     On an island in Loch Lomond, a bed of boulder clay occurs               con
 taining Arctic shells.
    In Arran,       beds of boulder      clay occur, with blocks     and broken
 shells (Abstract, p. 793.)
    In Aberdeenshire, thick masses of unstratified pebbly mud occur,
with stones.and Arctic shells, most of them broken, but               some entire
(Abstract, p. 772).
    In the Lewis, at           several   places,     boulder  clay  occurs,  with
boulders and fragments of sea-shells (Abstract, p. 821).
   In Caithness, at Keiss, Wick Bay, and Scrabster, there are beds
of boulder clay and drift, containing shells and stones, some of which
are scratched ; one boulder in the Wick clay bed is 12 feet in
length (Abstract, p. 794).
    In the Orkneys, the islands of Eda, Sanday, Stromsa, Shapinshay,
and Ronaldshay          present clay beds containing boulders foreign to the
islands, and marine shells, most of them broken or striated,              as well
as the boulders (Abstract,        p. 853).

  The        cases of boulders,                 with Balani and             Serpulce         found       on them,
have been explained by supposing that after these fish had grown on
them the boulders were lifted by floating ice and dropped elsewhere
(Abstract, pp. 786 and 860).
                         2.    Boulders on Surface                    of the     Country.
  (a) Boulders lying on flattest side occur so frequently that                                               it k
not necessary to quote cases.
  (b)       A   less frequent case is when boulders occur standing on end.
  This observed occasionally, when boulders                                         embedded         in clay or
sandy mud (see Estuary of Forth, p. 99, and Ed. Roy. Soc. Trans.,
voL xxviL p. 630, and Ram-say's Physical Geology, p. 155).
  Also observed on open surface                                       of the country             ;   when the
boulder         leans against               a    rock, as at Iona,                  of the large
                                                                               in the     case
boulder at Dun                I ;—and           of   a    small boulder near south end of island
(Abstract, p. 808).
      (c)   Butted against                  rocks,       or resting   on    or against other boulderx.
See such cases mentioned                             (Abstract, pp. 773, 780, 793, 808, S10,
812, 818, 836, 861, 862).
     (d) On steep sides of hills.
     In Abstract,     825, there
                              p.                         is   notice of an isolated            hill (Treshlik
Hill), on an exceedingly                         steep side        of which         a   large boulder rests
(Lithograph No. 31, Plate X.).
     In Abstract,]).           834, there         is     notice of another isolated           hill in Flichity
valley,         on which there are several boulders precariously                                         situated,
because         of the   steepness           of the hill-side (Lithograph No. 32, Plate                      X.).
     In     Abstract,     p.       824,     a   remark by Professor Duns                is   referred to,    with
regard to some granite boulders lying on                                a   part of Ben Nevis, where
the mountain             slopes down so                    steeply,
                                                                    " as to make              it     a   puzzle to
understand how they can remain in position."
     In     Abstract,^. 856, see similar cases, on Bochastlc                                Hill and      Clunie.
     In Abstract,         p.       862, notice           will   be found    of   a   large boulder resting
on   a      slope at an angle of so much as 47*.
     (e)     On tops      of   h    ills.
     In Aberdeenshire (Ballater), boulders of granite and gneiss are                                            on
the summit of             a        hill,    at height of 2963 feet               ;   there being no rocks
of that nature in situ on the hill (Abstract,                                  p.   770).
     In Aberdeenshire (Braemar) there                                 are boulders          on tops of hflfe

 reaching 2700 feet and 3587 feet above the sea (Abstract, pp. 770
  and 771).
    In Inverness-shire, at the heights of 2000, 3000, and 3155 feet,
 Lochaber (Abstract, pp. 824, 826, and 827) ;— of 3425, Albannach
 (Abstract, pp. 828, 829) ; 3407, Schehallion (Abstract p. 830).
     In island of Mull, a boulder on the top of Spyon More, at a
 height of 2435 feet abovo sea (Abstract, p. 808).
    In Kirkcudbrightshire, at a height of 27 64 on summit of Merrick
 (Abstract, p. 837).
    In    Glencoe    district,   boulders    found    on summits and peaks of
 Aonach and Eagach, and Meal Dearg, at height of 3110 feet above
 sea.     Professor Heddle remarks that          " these boulders lay on a ridge
 not many times wider than their own bulk," and " occupy positions
 much higher in level than any              of the  hills in a very wide      extent of
 country, so that it is difficult,       if  not impossible, to adopt for them
 the explanation of any local glacier" (Abstract, p. 830).
    The following are cases where boulders are on tops of hills of less
 height above the sea than in the cases just mentioned                  ;  but, being
 higher than any other hills in the district, they present          a feature similar
 to that    just noticed by Professor Heddle.            As examples of      these, re
 ference is made to boulders on East Loch Tarbert (Abstract, p. 775) ;
 Inverary and Loch Awe (Abstract, p. 777) ; Islay Island (Arnahoo)
 (Abstract,]). 806); Forfarshire (Abstract, p. 801)           ; Lochaber (Abstract,
 p. 825) ;      Kirkcudbright (Abstract, p. 837) ; Midlothian (Abstract,
 p. 840)    ;  and in Sutherland/hire (Abstract, p. 875).            Similar cases of
 boulders       perched on very precarious positions             probably     occur in
 Skye, judging by what is said of them by Macculloch                      and Forbes
 (Abstract,     p. 822).
   VI.     Cases where    Parent Rocks of Boulders         have almost certainly
                                    been ascertained.
    1.   In    Berwickshire,     granite,   sienite, porphyry,      and    whinstone
boulders       are  clearly    traceable to hills     situated    several miles      to
the westward (Abstract, pp. 787, 788, 789, 790).
    2.   In   Roxburghshire       there are similar     cases (Abstract,     p.   865),
in    some     instances    the    parent rocks being       at least 20 miles to
the westward.
    3.  In Peeblesshire,    a  quartz boulder, with much probability referred
to beds of quartz about 80 miles to the westward (Abstract,                    p. 855).

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                          895
    The  cases showing this,      which   are mentioned      in the Reports and
Abstract,     are so numerous that they need not be particularised.
    Testimony      to the north-westerly      direction   from which boulders
in Scotland have been carried, is given by the following geological
authorities — Professor Geikie {Abstract, p. 841) ; Sir Roderick Mur-
chison (Abstract, p. 795); Charles Maclaren (Abstract, p. 840); Robert
Chambers        (Abstract, p. 876);    J.   F. Campbell (Abstract,        p. 815);
J.  F. Jamieson (Abstract,       p. 795)  ;  Professor Harkness (Abstract, p.
797); W.      Jolly  (Abstract, p. 799);    Mr Anderson Smith (Abstract,         p.
776); John Young (Glasgow University) (Abstract, p. 839); James
Croll (Abstract, p. 841); T. Hay Cunningham (Abstract, p. 838).
    In  the Lewis there are kaims or escars on a very large scale,               —
continuous       for several miles, whose north-westerly           direction,  and
numbers       of boulders lying upon them,         suggest   the idea that they
may be due to the same agency which has transported the boulders
(Abstract,     p. 820).
    2. But whilst      a  movement from       north-westward     is very general
in Scotland, it is right to notice exceptional         cases.
    In  Loch Long and Loch Fyne there has been                a movement from
 N. or N. by E. (Abstract,       p. 774, 775).      In Islay (Abstract,    p. 806).
 Buteshire (Abstract, p. 791).
     In Morayshire and Elgin        Mr Jolly points out two           streams,  one
 from 6° S.    of west, — the  other from 15° N. of west (Abstract, p. 799).
    In   Perthshire      (Dunkeld)   the direction of the striae on the
 rocks at    a high level is from    N.N.W., — whilst at a lower level, in
 the same valley, it is from N.E. (Abstract, p. 857).             In the Lewis a
                          —
 similar case occurs; the direction of the movement at a high level
 being from      W.N.W. ; and at a low level, in the same district, from W.,
 or even W.S.W. (Abstract, p. 819).             In Assynt, whilst the normal
 direction is N. 60° W., the direction changes to due north, caused (as
  Chambers supposes) by the interference of a hill (Abstract, p. 875).
     So also near Gairloch, whilst the normal                movement      is from
 W.N.W.,       as shown by boulders and striaj, there is a        locality among
 the hills, where the movement is shown to have been from                  W.S.W.
 (Abstract, p. 861).
     Cases have already been noticed, where there are two sets of strisa
 crossing one       another.   Thus in Morayshire (Abstract,           p. 849) the
 N.W.     striae are crossed    by others of    a  later date coming from N.
 by E.

 896                  Proceedings    of the   Royal Society
    Near Glasgow there are rock surfaces presenting             two   sets of sue,
one    implying    a movement from the N.W. and N.E.                    respectrdj
 (Abstract, p. 838).
    These different directions in the lines of striae may, in some cases,
 indicate two separate agencies, moving independently of one ano'ja
 at different periods.       But it is   also  possible   that the      same agent
 might bo deflected      from its normal direction         by local      conditions.
 An example of such        a deflection is given by     Sir James Hall,         in his
 well-known paper on "Revolutions on the Earth's Surface" reaJbv
him in the year 1812, and printed in the 7th voL of the Ed. Roy. Sr.-
 Trans.      He names a locality (p. 196), where " the rock presents
furrows and scratches simdar to those on Corstorphine HilL" — but
where " the action of the stream lias undergone a visible modifica
tion, by the prominent        form of some parts of the rock, in               conse
quence     of which the dressings       have    in some    places     been tunwl
to the amount of 5° or 6° out           the general direction, which, how
                                     of
ever, they resume gradually       in  the course   of a few yarda"
    In Haddingtonshire, whilst the normal direction is generally
from W.N.W. on horizontal rock surfaces, the movement slightly
changes      where the striating    agent    struck upon,      and    had to     pass
over,    a  rock which sloped.       For example, at Linton,            on a rock
surface    sloping down due north, at an angle of 35°, the                direction
on that surface is E. and W. (Abstract, p.
                                                   803).
    At the railway cutting, not far from Linton,               the rock     surface
slopes down due north, at an angle of 10° to 20°            ;  and the opposing
rock surface     being hero of considerable extent, the direction            of the
stria? is  E.  15° N. (Abstract, p. 803).
    On North Berwick Law the smoothed rock surface dips down
N. 10° W., and the direction of the strias is E. 22° N. (Abstract,
p. 805).
    3.  Another    set  of facts,   bearing on the direction in         which the
transporting agent has moved, is the position of individual              boulders.
   A   very large proportion of boulders have been lodged on              the wed
slopes of hills.    Many are butted up against rocks, or lying            on other
boulders, in    a way   which shows that they came from the            tcestmrd-
    4.  Another fact has been observed, which shows that there           has been
a general    movement over this part of Europe from           a westerly point-
   Thus in describing the beds of boulder clay in the            neighbourhood

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                           897
of Edinburgh, the Rev. Dr Fleming               cites different localities where     it
clearly appears that the materials composing the boulder clay, had
been by some           extraneous agency pushed            towards   the  east; and
pushed so violently,         that the strata of rock covered by the boulder
clay had their edges broken off, and carried towards the east (Litho-
logy of Edinburgh, pp. 52 to 60).
    In like     manner, Professor         Geikie says that " the mass of the
boulder clay (in the basin of the Firth of Forth for instance) con
sists of the comminuted debris of the Carboniferous and other rocks
which form the framework                 of the district       We   can also gather
that this loose fragmentary matter has moved from west to east.                     In
the upper part of the basin of the             Firth of Forth the coal fields      are
covered with red boulder clay, abounding in fragments                   of  the rocks
that lie towards the N.W., and deriving its prevalent tint from the
waste of the Old Eed Sandstones, and stretches up to the foot of the
Highland mountains" (Olaeial drift,               p. 805).
    5. If   the foregoing data aro sufficient to establish the general
fact that the transporting           and striating     agent has moved in most
parts of Scotland from the north-westward,               the question arises,   What
was that agent       ?
    In   regard      to boulders       in Forfarshire       and Aberdeenshire,       it
 might    be   inferred     that they were brought           by glaciers from the
Grampians        and other mountainous           districts   there.    But   some    of
 these   boulders are at such heights as to suggest                 doubts whether
any glacier could have been generated at such a level as to bring
these   bouldeis.        Moreover,      several of the Forfarshire boulders,         if
they came from the mountains                 to  the west,     must    have   crossed
valleys and ridges of hills, which would                have seriously obstructed
the flow of     a  glacier {Abstract, p. 801).
    In  some      districts, however, there is undoubtedly              evidence    to
establish glacier action       ; — as in  Olencoe (Abstract, p. 830).      Professor
Heddle and Mr Livingstone satisfied themselves of the existence
of one or      more glaciers on the west flanks             of Ben Nevis, though
Mr Livingstone          sees difficulties  which he cannot explain (Abstract,
p. 824).      Professor      Duns   seems also to recognise the       probability of
a  Ben Nevis glacier (Abstract, p. 824). In Nairn Valley there are
also appearances which suggest the agency of a local glacier
(Abstract, p. 835).          Loch Skene is another case (Abstract, p. 796).

898                          Proceedings          of   the    Royal Society
    In Glen Etive and Lorh Etiw                              there    are    indubitable                 traces of
glacial     action at a low level, moving                        from        Loch Awe (AUtPvi.
p. 782).
    But in Inverness-shire there                       are boulders,          reported              on by            Pro
fessor Heddle, which, as they must have crossed deep valleys, floating
ice must be preferred for agency of transport                                     in   these cases (Ab
stract, p. 829).              See    also    Ruberslaw (Abstract,                 p. 866)           ;    Shetland
(Abstract,        p.    869).       Forfarshire          (Abstract,          p.    801).             Sutherland
(Abstract, p. 875).
  That at the Boulder                 period floating ice of some kind                              existed can
scarcely be doubted.
    The confident testimony of Dr Chambers,                                   Professor Nicol,                       and
Mr Jamieson, that the positions of the boulders and                                      the direction of
the rock striations on the north-west coast are inexplicable,                                                 except
on the supposition              that the transporting                 and striating                 agent           came
there from             the   sea,    scarcely      leaves        room        for doubt                  (Alstraet,
p. 795).
    The transport of boulders from the westward is                                 especially               interest
ing in those localities                  on the north and north-west                           of Scotland,
where towards the west there is nothing but open                                       sea.
    Thus,     on the islands                of   Tiree and Coll, and at Borve                                 on the
west coast of Harris, the boulders are in such positions,                                                     that to
reach these positions they mu^t have come across the                                      sea.
    In    the Shetlands             and Orkneys there are on almost                             every island
boulders which, differing in mineral constituents                                  from         the         rocki      of
the island, must have been transported                               across sovie portion                     <•/   *<>>'
and accordingly Messrs Peach and Home, who have lately                                                   explowd
the geology and the glacial phenomena of the islands, give                                              a   decided
opinion that on              these islands        land glaciers          were not the transport
ing      agent.        They say that in the Orkneys " the islands must hare

been overflowed           by ice — ice which " originated beyond the linuK

                      of Edinburgh,    Session    1883-84                        899
from     W.N.W. (Abstract,      p.  870).   On the island of Papa Stour
there are blocks which apparently came across St Magnus Bay from
a  N.E. direction (Abstract,    p. 867).    But in other      cases the boulders
on the islands must have been floated from many different directions.
    It  is also proper to notice the fact, that     in some      of the islands of
the Hebrides, and even on portions of the west               coast of the     Main
land, the positions of the boulders indicate            a movement, not from
W.N.W.       (the normal direction for Scotland generally), but from N.
or N. by E.,      as  in Islay (Abstract,   p.   806), in Iona (Abstract, p.
 808).     Loch Fyne (Abstract, p. 777) ; Kintyre (Abstract, p. 773).
 Buteshire (Abstract, p 791).
    But these exceptions do not greatly detract from the value of the
 generally concurring      evidence, everywhere else, of         a direction   from
 W.N.W.
     It is also an important     circumstance      that the part of Scotland
 where the boulders are largest, heaviest,           and most numerous,            is
 along the west coast (see p. 886).        If  floating ice brought boulders
 across the Atlantic, the first place where boulders would be dis
 charged would be where the sea bottom rose high enough to inter
 rupt the progress of the ice. The ice carrying the largest and heaviest
 boulders would most probably strike the sea bottom soonest ; whilst
 the ice carrying smaller cargoes would flow on,          till  these reached the
 submarine rocks which now form the present inland mountains.
     As bearing on the question, whether land ice or                sea ice was the
 transporting    agent, another circumstance brought out            in the Beports
 must     be kept    in view.     Some boulders       on the tops and         ridges
 of mountains      are at heights   far above what could bo reached by
 a glacier having      its birthplace   in any adjoining district.             Such
 are the boulders       at heights  exceeding 3000 feet         ;  and even when
 at lower heights, it would be necessary,           for upholding the glacier
 theory, to have mountains         pointed  out where glaciers could have
 been formed, and with       a valley through which the glacier could have
 flowed in the direction of the boulder.        But even      if  this difficulty of
 levels could be overcome, there is still another in explaining how a
 glacier could set down on the very tops of hills, or on excessively
  steep   slopes of hills, boulders     which    are frequently       seen  in  these
  critical positions.
      Floating ice stranding on mountain tops or               slopes,    might, by

 900                  Proceedings     of the Royal   Society
gradually    melting,     allow boulders to obtain       these   singular    lodg
ments.
   Of  course,  if  the theory of floating     ice be adopted,      the  position
of boulders     at heights      of 3000 feet implies       a sea which       must
have stood at that height,         or more, above the present sea-leTel          in
Britain.    In that supposition there is no improbability.            Moreover,
beds of sand, mud, and gravel (proofs         of marine conditions) actually
exist in several parts of Perthshire, up to a level of 1500 feet, 1600
feet, 2000 feet and more (Abstract, pp. 857, 858) ; on Ben Cnwcbin,
up to 2000 feet (Abstract, p. 783) ; in Glencoe, up to 2000 feet (Ab
stract, p. 830) ; and on Schehallion, at a height of 3000 feet
(Abstract, p. 858).       The Ordnance surveyors reported drift beds *t
a height of even 3800 feet (Abstract, p. 831, footnote).                 Terraces
on gravel andsand at 1200 feet (Abstract, p. 832).
   In Scotland, sea-shells — and generally of an Arctic type — have
been found in clay or gravel beds up to a height of about 520                  feet
above sea-leveL        In   several parts of the west of England             these
shells occur in similar       deposits up to a height of about        1200 feet,
and in Ireland (near Dublin) up to a height of 1400 feet                    aboTe
sea-leveL      At the time when the sea stood at either of                   these
heights in England and Ireland, it could not with any probability
have been lower      in Scotland.
   Allusion    has been made to deflections in the direction of                 the
transporting agent, when it struck upon rocks, which slope towards
certain points,     and at different angles.       These deflections       can   be
understood     and accounted for on the supposition             of an     oceanic
current   with floating       ice.    For by flowing over      a   rock, which
obstructed its normal progress,        the current might be deflected         froce
its usual course.       These deflections it would not be easy to explain
on the theory of solid land ice moving over the country.
   Another circumstance favouring the theory of an oceanic               current,
with floating    ice, to account for the movement       of boulders,      and the
striation of both boulders and rocks, is the presence of marine sktfl*,
of Arctic types, in beds of drift containing              boulders.     In nod
 of the cases referred to some           of the shells  have been crushed,
whilst others     are entire    and unhurt.      What more        probable      ex
planation can be given of these facts, than that masses of ice Soil
ing on a sea current would,         on touching   the sea bottom,      discharge

                       of Edinburgh,        Session 1883-84.                     901
their    cargoes   of rocks and rubbish, and at the            same    time plough
through the sea bottom, pushing forward boulders, and crushing shell
fish!     (Seep. 891.)
   It   is a fact confirmatory of this view, that bods of boulder clay
never show stratification,         and that, moreover, in respect of colour
and materials, they closely resemble hardened or compressed mud,
apparently composed of the debris of rocks which had undergone
disruption and friction by           some     extraneous   agent.     Boulder clay
is found everywhere in Scotland, — so that there must have been one
general agent instrumental in forming the deposit ; and it is difficult
to conceive a more probable agent than sea currents, with floating
ice, grinding and grating over submarine rocks.
   Another       circumstance       (shown in the Committee's .Reports)
indicates    oceanic agency, viz., the uniformity all over Scotland of
the    direction    of the    striae   on rocks     and   boulders,    and    of the
direction of the longer axis of boulders.               In  almost every part of
Scotland     there has manifestly been some agent of immense power,
which has been for          a long period passing over from the            W.N.W.
What other agent would produce               these concurrent effects over a con
siderable portion of the earth's surface than a great oceanic current                ?
   No such       effects  are  likely to have been produced             by   an  ice-
sheet however gigantic, or still less by local glaciers.
   The deflections from that normal direction, which are mentioned
in the Reports      as occurring   in  some localities, are not    only not incon
sistent with the theory of an oceanic current, but                   are  just what
might     be expected, inasmuch           as when    currents    flow over a bed
which contains obstructions, eddies and deflections               are produced, so
that   these   partial   deviations     from the normal direction         strengthen
rather than weaken the theory of a great sea current.
   There are also two districts crossing Scotland where the movement
has   been, by some       special cause, deflected from the normal             N.W.
direction.     In the low-level district between the Firths of Clyde and
Forth, where the highest point             is about 150 feet above the sea, the
direction is about due E. and          W. {Abstract, pp. 847 and 872).            So
also  in the valley crossing the south of Scotland, the                 east part  of
which is occupied by the River Tweed and its tributaries, and the
west part by the Rivers Liddell and Esk, the direction as shown by
boulders, and by striations on rocks, is from            W.S.W. in the western

  902                    Proceedings     of the Royal    Society
  districts (Abstract, p. 865), and N. 10°          W. (Abstract,    p. 790) in    the
  eastern   districts.
     These deflections from the normal direction,               both on the      west
 coast and     in the two districts across Scotland just referred to,          can be
  explained on the theory of a            N.W. oceanic current.        The   current,
  on reaching what are now the high mountains of Argyle&hire, might
  be deflected there into a more southern direction ; and when                    the
 current     reached the two         valleys   referred to,  it might be      drawn
 through them by the absence in them of any obstruction.
     That   some oceanic current has passed through the southern valley
 seems    evident      from the numbers and direction            of the    k&ims    in
 Roxburghshire and Berwickshire (Abstract, pp. 865 and 790).
     The Convener (in a paper in the Edin. Roy. Soc, Trans.,                     voL
 xxviL    p. 44) ascribed the formation of these kaims to oceanic actio*
 through     a submarine channel, formed            by  a range   of hills  on each
 side  ; and in support of his view he referred to the following             passage
 in Professor Geikie's work on the Great Ice Age (p. 248), where he
 observes, that "when we note that strings of gravel ridges and
 mounds       may    sometimes      be   followed    up  one   valley,  across   the
 dividing    col,  into   a totally different drainage system, we       cannot but
 conclude that ordinary          river action is out of the question           as an
 explanation of the phenomena.               In  the present state   of our   know
 ledge we appear to have no alternative but in such cases to admit
 the marine     origin of such kaims."
    These Berwickshire          and Roxburghshire        kaims    present features
 similar to the kaims of the Lewis (Abstract, p. 819), except that the
 agent which formed them moved in a different direction, owing to
 the difference of the conditions which influenced the current in                tbe
respective localities.
    6.  A  question may be asked, that        if there existed  both local glaciers
and floating ice, as agencies           for the transport of boulders and        the
 striation of rocks, which of these agencies was first in operation f
    The data are too scanty to allow of this question being answered
with any      confidence.
    In the Abstract,      p. 831, where reference     is made to GUncoe1 and in
Abstract, p. 835, where reference is made to Farr, it will be seen that
an opinion is offered that glaciers existed first, and that submerg
ence   of the country took place aftenoards.

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                            903
    7.  It remains to notice what light is thrown on the subject by
the Faroe Islands.
    As Professor Geikie is satisfied that glaciers, or an               ice sheet  of
some     kind, existed, capable of glaciating             the rocks and moving
boulders,     that    view,    entertained     by an     observer     of   so  much
experience and intelligence,         will  be at once accepted.
    But the farther        question    arises,   Whether there is evidence of
there    having      existed also,   at some      other period,      the agency of
floating ice   ?
    Professor Geikie does not admit that there is such evidence;                  and
it has to be confessed that only           one place on the islands has as yet
been pointed out where such evidence is alleged to exist.
    Mr Allan having drawn attention to the peninsula                        of Eide,
as    presenting     rock    smoo things    and    striations     similar to those
pointed     out by Sir James         Hall on Corstorphine          Hill, Dr Eobert
Chambers,        when     he visited     the    Faroes   forty   years afterwards,
went to Eide, on purpose (as he says) to study the appearances
which Mr Allan had only generally described.                        He states that
he "looked         narrowly     for the strLe or scratches;" and saw that
 " they presented themselves in abundance in several places ;
                                                                               "
                                                                                  and
he says that         he was satisfied that they were            " all directed from
 the north."
    Professor     Geikie,    in his Memoir, adverting         to these same rocks,
states, they are
                       " perhaps the best preserved         roches   moutonnies he
 anywhere     observed;"— but       as to the direction     in which the smooth
 ing and striating agent had moved, which Dr Chambers alleged to
 be  " from the north," Professor Geikie             states that the strise     " had
 clearly been graved by ice, coming from quite the opposite point of
                 "
 the compass        (p. 246).
    The Professor follows up this statement by explaining (p. 261)
 that " the long sound that separates Osteroe from Stromb'e (must
 have) brimmed with ice, which flowed in two directions ; north of
 Nordskaale ttie movement was northerly, while south of the shallow
 part of that sound the ice held on a southerly course."
    It  is unfortunate      that thus Professor       Geikie and Dr Chambers,
 both    of them competent and experienced observers, should have
 given opposite testimonies in this matter.
    The question at issue being,            as Professor     Geikie   states,  one of

 904                            Proceedings     of the Royal        Society
 " considerable interest," it may                 be allowable to          inquire whether
circumstances exist calculated to throw light upon it.
   The glaciation and striaj on the rocks at Eide were                               by Di
Chambers ascribed to agency which came                              " from the north," Tit,
sea-ice.         By Professor Geikio             these were ascribed to the                    agency of
land-ice, filling what is now the sound of Nordskaale,                                         of which
land-ice, one portion flowed north towards Eide, and the other por
tion      held on a southerly                 course,     each     thus    flowing        in opposite
directions from what had once been a col, or head of two separate
valleys.
   (1) There is one circumstance which seems to favour the view
taken by Chambers, viz., that Mr Allan, when he examined the
rocks,       evidently          considered      that the agent            which       produced         the
markings,          was the           sea.      He adopted           for    an     explanation              of
these,       Sir       James        Hall's     opinion,         suggested        by      the     similar
phenomena              on Corstorphine            Hill, viz.,        diluvial         agency.         The
smoothed and striated                    rocks on the sea-coast             at Eide forming                a
"                      as   Mr Allan called             it,   would no doubt             seem    to him
     headland/'
well      suited       to illustrate         such an agency.              He accordingly             takes
notice of these rocks as
                                         " scooped and scratched in             a   very wonderful
degree,      not only on the horizontal surface, but also on                          a   vertical one,
of 30     to 40 feet            high, which had           been opposed      to the current, and
presented the same scooping and polished appearance with the rest
of the rocks, both               above and below."
     If   this    be   a    correct view of        Mr Allan's opinion, ho                  is   so   far   a
witness corroborative of Chambers.
   (2) Another circumstance bearing on the question,   the apparent                 is
difficulty of any glacier being formed which could reach the rocks
at Eide, glaciated as they are, up to height of 1302 feet (Abttnict,
                                                          a
p.   879).
   The distance of Eide from the col (from which Professor Geikie
supposes the glacier to have flowed in its northward course)                                               ia
between       8    and      9   miles.      At the col        (as the map shows)           the valley
is   exceedingly narrow, and the hills on each side apparently are not
so   high or       so shaped as to afford good gathering                     ground for a lsxg?
accumulation of ice.                 The hills there do not seem to be above 2000
feet high.         Supposing ice to have filled the valley there even up to
that height, and to flow towards the north, would                           it  ever reach       EiJr      f

                                of Edinburgh,           Session 1883-84.                                  905
     There      are two           difficulties        in the way.               First, the map shows
that hetween the Col and Eide the valley widens immensely, so
that the glacier would almost certainly stop and hreak up at that
place where there is hoth breadth and depth.                                      Second, there is no
gradient along the bottom of the valley from the Col to Eide to
draw down a glacier, because, as Professor Geikie explains, the depth
of water in the sound at Eide is much                                   less than at places between
Eide and the Col (Abstract, p. 880).
     In   these circumstances, there seems more                             probability that at this
place the striations                  and smoothings were made by sea-ice than by
a glacier.
  (3) The mouth of the fiord is open towards the north, and
when the Faroes were 1600 or 2000 feet submerged, there
would be ample opportunity                            for floating ice to pass through                     the
sound.
     This view             is    to    a    certain     extent          supported        by     the   curious
circumstance,              that       in many         parts        of    the    Faroes        the hills    are
glaciated        everywhere                below a pretty           uniform level of 1600                 feet,
whilst     above that level                most of them are rough.                      In thalfnorthern
latitude,       if   land-ice prevailed generally, so as to produce an ice-sheet
or local glaciers, one                     does   not   see    why the hills should not have
been covered and glaciated to their tops.
     Moreover,         if it      is established that to the                     W. and N.W. of the
mainland of Scotland                       floating ice was brought by some north-west
oceanic current,                the fact that the Faroes                    are    2°    farther north in
latitude        would bring them the more readily within reach of such a
current.
     8.   The conclusion to which the facts                forth in this summary
                                                                          set
lead      is,   that   if       boulders were brought to this country by    great                     a
north-westerly             oceanic current, some of these boulders now on our
hills may, in mineralogical composition, be found to differ from
British rocks and in that view,
                       ;             only right to notice, that two

geologists, having considerable personal knowledge of British rocks,
state that boulders have been seenby them in this country, differing
in mineral composition from any rocks in Great Britain with which
they were acquainted                         One of these authorities                    is   the late Pro

is   Mr James              Plant of Leicester, to whom the English Boulder

906                    Proceedings     of the Royal Society
Committee, in their Secand Report (for 1874, p. 197), refer in tLs
terms    : —
    Mr James Plant reports both " isolated boulders                  and    groups of
boulders, and he records one remarkable fact of especial                 importance,
viz., that    a  group of boulders had been exposed              in an     excavatica
made in Leicester, 25 feet deep, composed            of rocks, which Mr Pkit
failed to recognise as British."
    If  this testimony be verified, the fact would be           in pari     cast* with
the case of the three plants * found in the Hebrides and the wk;
coast of Ireland, but unknown in any other part of Europe, whosa
native habitat is Boreal America, and whose               transportation         to our
shores the late Professor       Edward Forbes did not hesitate               to ascribe
to floating ice (Memoirs       of  the Geological Survey        of Great       Britain,
vol. L).
    Finally, it may     be asked,   if the theory of an oceanic current with
floating ice be adopted to account for most of the boulders in                     Scot
land, especially those        on   the west and      north-west       coasts, — frorn
what country could the boulders have come, and what could                          have
produced* this current?
    The Committee, though not acknowledging                 the impossibility of
suggesting an answer to this question, think that were they                           to
venture on doing so, they would be trespassing               beyond the         objects
of their appointment.          Their proper province has been simply to
collect     facts   bearing on boulders in Scotland, embracing their
distribution,      their positions, and the agencies        probably       concerned
in    their    transport.    To explain      the source      or   origin of       these
agencies, or,     in other words, to unravel     the conditions      of   the earth's
previous history, so as to account for these agencies, is                  a problem
the solution of which must be left to others.

 5.   Remarks by     Mr Milne Home          on presenting Tenth       Report
               of Boulder Committee, 21st         July   1884.
     In presenting this the Tenth and Final Report of the Society's
 Boulder Committee,     I hope   to be allowed to offer some explanations
 bearing on the work which the Committee has been able to accom
 plish.
     The chief object for which the Committee was appointed, being
 to obtain from Scotland, generally, as much information          as possible
 regarding boulders, the Committee could think of no better plan of
 commencing     work, than by addressing circulars, first to the clergy
 man, and next to the schoolmaster in every rural parish (including
 the Hebrides, Orkney, and Shetland), asking whether any boulders
 of large size existed in these parishes'! — and if so, inviting informa
tion regarding such boulders, on points which it was expected
 might without much difficulty be understood and answered by the
parties addressed.
     The Committee    were   gratified by the readiness with which these
appeals were responded to      ; and   I now, in name of the Committee,
or rather, may    I venture to say, in name of the Royal Society, beg
to express our thanks      for the courtesy shown to us by        those who
sent answers.
    Independently    of information      about boulders   contained   in the
answers to our Circulars, the Committee         discovered from many of
these answers, the names and addresses        of persons in different parts
of the country, who, we were       told, took an interest in the objects of
the Committee, and who were even so obliging as to allow it to be
mentioned to us, that they would be happy to show the boulders in
their neighbourhood to any members of the Committee.            These offers
came not only from clergymen and schoolmasters,          but from resident
landed proprietors     and others, who through        the clergy and     the
schoolmasters in their several        parishes happened     to hear  of the

908                      Proceedings        of   the   Royal Socieiy
inquiries    which our Society had                set on foot ; and now,                    by way         if.
acknowledging         the services, and in some cases also the hospitality
rendered hy the persons to whom                  I     refer,
                                                            I        propose to leave in :k
hands of our Secretary the names                       and addresses of these                    persona,
not doubting        that,   if   any one desires to obtain further information
regarding boulders situated at or near the places where they reside,
they would,     if   applied to, be still willing to aid in the inquiry.
    At the   close of the Committee's Report, there                           is   in Appendix            II
a memorandum, called             a   Summary of Facts, and of inferences from
the facts, bearing on the question,              What was the nature of the                       agency
by which boulders were brought to their present sites                               ?
    This being the critical question, for the elucidation and diseussion
of which the Committee                 was expected             to gather           data,    it   would
have been desirable had the Committee,                           as       a   united      body, pro
nounced findings in which the members could all concur.                                      I    knew,
however, that       it   was hardly possible to expect this                    ;    and I    saw that
the best course would be for me, as Convener, to undertake the duty
of framing      a   memorandum, and submitting                       it   to the Committee for
insertion    in the Eeport,            as an     Appendix, on the understanding,
however, that no one but myself should be committed to the views
contained in it.  This course was approved of by the Committee.
But  I  felt my own responsibility in this matter so much, that at
our last Committee meeting,    earnestly urged one of my colleagues,
                                       I
who   I     believed was eminently               competent, to draw out                      a    memo-
randum of his own views, independently                          and irrespective of               mine.
I   regret to say, that on the ground of his not thinking himself                                   able
for the duty, he          too    modestly declined              it
                                                                 ;        though from what             I
knew, and what the Council knows of this gentleman's qualifici-
tions,   I   feel sure      that any memorandum                      from him would                have
added greatly to the value of this Report.
I      may now state in          a   few sentences        the conclusions               to which,      u
Convener,    I      have        come   in   this inquiry, after                     giving       mature
consideration to the investigations of the Committee.                                 These are —
    1.   That at    some     period, geologically           recent in the earth's                   his
tory, an Arctic climate           prevailed in this part of Northern Europe
which     had   the effect of producing                local glaciers in Scotland                  ;   of
some     of which        glaciers there are traces still visible in the                           most
mountainous of our districts, as pointed out in our last Report

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                                              909
     2.    That subsequently      Scotland         was    for    a    considerable             time
submerged        beneath    the      sea,   which         over-topped            our         highest
mountains, covering them, and filling most of our valleys with sand,
gravel, and mud, beds of which are                       noticed      in our Reports               as
still visible, up to a height of at least 3000 feet above the present
sea-level, — thereby concealing to a great extent, traces of the pre
vious local land glaciation.
     3.    That whilst Scotland         was     so       submerged,           and      probably
simultaneously,      with the whole of the British Isles, and much of
Northern Europe,           an   oceanic     current from             some     north-westerly
quarter      prevailed,   bringing    masses       of floating        ice,    with boulders
upon                        were deposited on our hills (then sub
           them, which boulders
marine) when the ice stranded on these hills.
  4. That the existence of this north-westerly current         not                     is,   if
certainly proved, at all events made highly probable,, by the follow
ing considerations: —
   (1) That boulders of all          sizes, and differing             from the rocks on
which they lie, are        more    numerous on the west coast                    of Scotland
(including the Hebrides) than elsewhere.
   (2) That when boulders are on hill slopes anywhere                                   in Scot
land, these      slopes   more frequently          face    the west          than any other
point.
   (3) That when boulders have    longer anda    shorter axis, and   a
are narrower at one end than at the other, the longer axis and the
narrow end very generally point towards the                     N.W.
     (4) That when boulders are found lying against    rock, in such         a
a    way as to show that this rock had slotted the farther progress
of   the    boulder, the relative positions          of    the boulder           and of           the
obstructing     rock imply, in     a   great       majority of cases, transport of
the boulder from the westward.
   (5) That many boulders are found on or near the tops of hills,
at such heights above sea-level that no local glacier, assuming such
to have been generated in neighbouring                    hills, could have the posi
tions of the boulders.
  (6) That on open ground, almost everywhere in Scotland, and
more especially on the west coast of Scotland, including the Hebrides,
the smoothings aud the striations of the rocks show                      a   movement over
them from some north-westerly             point.

910                     Proceedings      of tlie Moyal Society
    (7) That several plants are found on the west of Scotland sii
of Ireland, but nowhere else in Great Britian or Northern Europe,
which plants are stated, on botanical authority, to abound in Bvr»i
America, as their native habitats.
    With     reference    to the view thus taken,         that boulders in      Scotland
 were carried on ice floated by the sea,            it is curious, historically, that
 we should       now come back to the           theory suggested in this Society
sixty-two      years   ago by a remarkable man,             then President         of    the
Society, Sir James Hall of Dunglass, whose views, however, on                           this
subject have not always been correctly represented                      by    geological
authors.       It  has been     alleged   that in his well-known paper,              dated
 March     16,    1812,    "On the Revolutions of the Earth's                  Surface,0
published       in our Transactions,         vol. viL pp. 139—211,           Sir   James
sought to explain the transport of boulders by                 diluvial  aetion alont;
i.e.,  by great sea waves, such as those which ingulfed Lisbon                          and
several    cities on the west coast of South America.                   But     this is    a
mistake,     as  I  should like to show, by quoting one or two                sentences
from his paper.
    At   page 161,     Sir James, alluding        to the different theories started
by    Saussure and others to account for the transport                   of   boulders,
mentions one, suggested           by  a  Professor Wrede of Berlin, viz.,            that
the boulders        in North Germany " had been transported                 across     the
Baltic, by means         of the wind on floats of ice, and settling in              their
present place, had been left there by the retiring waters."
    Sir James then         expresses his own opinion thus —
                                                                     " If  the pheno
mena     on the banks of the lake of Geneva were really occasioned
by a torrent of water, its magnitude must have been such                          as    to
leave    few vestiges       of the human raee, and we can only                   expect
proofs of it in geological facta.             It  may, however, be alleged,         as   I
have    already hinted, that it would            be impossible    for  water of a*f
depth whatever, or moving with any velocity,                to  carry blocks of    suth
magnitude to such situations;              and this consideration         is of such
importance, that        I   am induced,     in attempting      to unite the ideas ol
Saussure      with those of Hutton,           to retain part of the system          pro
posed    by Professor Wrede,          in   so far as to consider those gnnit*
blocks    as  having been made        to float   by means    of masses of ice.''
    The opinion       thus adopted and propounded by Sir James                    B»H
was conceived at a time when nothing was known of icebergs                          and

                        of Edinburgh,     Session   1883-84                    911
icefloes   in the Arctic regions carrying             boulders     and   depositing
them at a distance from the parent rocks, and is a proof of the
same remarkable intuition which was. manifested by                   Sir James in
other well-known, philosophical speculations.
    In  conclusion, and as        I will probably not have another oppor
tunity in this Society of saying          so, may   I express     a hope that the
subject of "boztlder transport"        will continue to excite interest among
our   members.         If  important    truths   bearing on the most recent
revolutions    on. the     Earth's surface    are, as  I  venture to think they
are, likely to be established by investigations             such as those which
have been for       some      years carried on in Scotland,        and which     are
now carried on also in. England by the Committee of the British
Association,     I   trust that any proposal to. have a new Committee
will   be favourably       listened to.    It  should    not   be   forgotten  that
our Society,     so  far back    as 1812, was the first      in Great Britain to
bring this subject before the scientific world            ;  and also that in the
year   1871, at the instance of the late           Sir Robert Christison, then
 our President, we again led the way in originating an extended
inquiry.      In  these    circumstances,   I  cannot doubt that the Society,
 for the    sake   alike    of past memories, as of future            probable dis
 coveries,   will   be    disposed   to. encourage     further    research  in this
 interesting field of geological knowledge.

                                 I.   LOCHABER.
      About eight or ten     years   ago, when     in Lochaber,    studying the
  " Parallel Roadg:" problem,       I became    acquainted with a district in
  the valley of the River Spean, which presented the phenomena of
 gravel banks or kaims, and boulders, on            a  larger scale than   I  had
 ever before or have since met with.
      The lowest of the "Parallel Roads," marked No.                IY.  on the
 Ordnance Survey Maps, traverses this district; and whilst tracing the
 direction    of the " Road,"      as   it crosses  the lines of these     banks
 and boulders,     I was  greatly puzzled to account for them, and still
 more for the lines in which they had been deposited.                    I   took
 notes, and made rough sketches of both at the time, hoping that
 I   might have an opportunity         of a more special investigation.         A
 failure   of bodily strength     supervened, which deprived          me of the
 opportunity ; but as     I deem    the district well worthy of the atten
 tion of geologists, on account of the light it            seems  to throw     on
questions of much interest,       I propose to give      a short account  of the
facts observed on the occasions referred to, taken from notes and
sketches made at the time.
     Much   assistance  can now be obtained for an examination of the
district from the Ordnance Survey Maps.                   At the instance of
several scientific Societies, Her Majesty's Government gave autho
rity to the late Sir Henry James, then Director-General                  of the
Survey, to have special maps made, to indicate the "Parallel
         "
Roads in the different Lochaber valleys ; and latterly, at the joint
request     of   the   Edinburgh       Royal    and    Edinburgh     Geological

914                    Proceedings       of the Royal    Society
Societies, he caused         a  map (on the 6-inch scale) to be executed i
the particular      districts in the Spean valley, to which            I am about to
refer.
    This district is in that part of the valley where the River Spean,
flowing from Loch Laggan, i6 joined by a smaller stream from Loth
Treig,
    The Outline Map        A (Plate XL) gives       a general  idea of the position
of the gravel banks, with reference to Loch Treig and the adjoining
Rivers      Spean and Treig.         The dark    (lotted line indicates    shelf IV.,
being     the lowest beach of the lake which stood at a height of
about      855   feet   above    the sea-leveL      The dark shaded         line, sur
rounding       the valley, shows generally the position of the adjoining
hills,  at a level above the sea of from 1300 to 1500 feet
    I had    my attention first drawn to these banks and boulders when
walking along the line of shelf IV., near the mouth of Loch Treig.
On     looking     up at      the  hill  slope  situated to     the   south of this
loch,   I   noticed several projecting lines of terraces, at much higher
levels than shelf        IV., and at first thought that they might                repre
sent     some    of   the   shelves    of the higher lakes, which had been
recognised      in other Lochaber       glens, but not    in this  one.
    I thereupon ascended         the hill, and, on doing so, obtained       a general
 view of the low grounds, and of the remarkable assemblage                     there of
 kaims and boulders.             I  at  once saw that      many of both formed
lines, in some cases rectilineal, but also and even more frequently
 curvilineal,     the inner       curves facing      the north, i.e., down         Gleu
 Spean.       (See  A on Sketch Map, Plate XL)
    The first terrace on the hill slope which                  I  reached     was (by
 aneroid) at a height of 1 1 20 feet above sea-leveL               The terrace pre
sented a level surface from 40 to 50 feet wide, abutting against the
hill, and    was composed        of water-borne graveL        Two great       boulders
lay on this terrace, about 200 yards apart.
    From this terrace         I climbed    to another, at   a height of 1165 feet
 above sea-level ; on        it were three large boulders.
    There was still another terrace, and its height above the                     sea  I
 found to be 1175 feet.
    Again     a higher     terrace   was reached,      1480 feet above        the   sea,
somewhat broader than               the others,     and having       a   considerable
number of boulders on it.

                      of Edinburgh,        Session 1883-84.                          915
    I did  not observe any terraces at a higher level              ;  but   I  saw that
 there were many boulders on the slope of the                 hill above,       some   of
 large size.
    With the view of proceeding next to the low grounds, where the
extended lines of kaims and boulders were seen to be situated,                          I
walked south along the highest of the above terraces, and observed
that.it gradually      ceased    to touch or abut         with    a flat surface on
the hill, and that     it  became     separated from the         hill by      a narrow
trough, as    if the detritus next the hill had         been scoured out          by the
action of water currents, or of rain descending on                it from the slope
of the hill.      The  terrace   at length became        so narrow       as to become
a bank or ridge, the outer          flank     of which     was,   of    course,    much
higher than the flank next the hill.
    The upper surface of the terrace now ceased to be horizontal, and
sloped down towards the S.E.              As   1 proceeded,    I  observed,      on my
right hand,      some  rocks much smoothed)            at a height of from         1 500
to 1600 feet.
    A little  further south,    I came    to a projecting     rocky corner of the
hill, named       Craig Dhubh,        indicated     on the one-inch           Ordnance
Map by the sudden bending of the contour lines towards the S.W.
The surfaces of the rocks there were seen to have been greatly
smoothed (apparently         from the north),        whilst immense          masses    of
rock were lying at the foot of the crag:              It  was only at this corner
of the   hill that any smoothing of        these masses existed.           Rocks    con
tinued    in a  S.W. direction without any such features.                   The agent
which    had produced these         effects   had,   at this     point,     apparently
slanted off towards the S:E.
    Before    descending    further,    I   looked with my           glass   across the
valley   towards the hills on the east, and descried                    there    several
lines of terrace on the south projecting shoulder of Craig Dim and
Connichte, and also on some high ground                   near the Rough Burn
(Sketch Map B, Plate XI.).             These    I decided    on visiting, after       in
spection of the low grounds immediately              below me.
    In my way towards the low grounds A,                 I  walked along         a kaim
or gravel bank, whose course followed             a direction about        E.S.E., and
sloped downwards,        with    steep   sides from 20 to 30 feet high.                 I
observed that there were also many boulders on the low grounds,
some   of them forming lines or        trainees.

916                   Proceedings        of the Royal      Society
   The district occupied by these kaims was tolerably flat, and                     about
21    miles wide (in an east and west direction)                  across    the   genera!
course of the River Spean.
    There were      several      lines of kaims        all approximately paralltl,
and presenting a                                  —
                          slight curvature ; the inner curves facing the
north, or down the valley of the Spean.
    At   one place     there     was an interruption         in the continuous         line
of the northernmost            bank, as     if it had     been broken       through by
some agent       from the north; and            I  took a rough sketch of it             on
 the spot, being fig.      1  on    Plate  XIII.
     At  A, the kaim BC ceases for about twenty yards; and between
 this   " break,"     and the         other    bank     DE, there is a          heap      of
 boulders.
     The   highest and thickest           of the two banks is BAG, and on it
 the greatest number of boulders are accumulated.
     On the low ground to the north of these kaims there are many grey
 granite boulders of various sizes scattered about, mostly angular.
     There   two knobs about twelve or eighteen feet high                       attracted
 my attention, in consequence             of there being boulders on their           tops.
  One of the knobs was of detritus;               the other of rock, sloping down
  steeply on all sides, except the east.
     In  each   case the diameter           of the flat surface at the top            was
  about six or seven         yards,    and there were      five   or six boulders        on
  each; — most of the boulders were on the sides facing the N. and
  N.W.
     In   several   places, and especially at          the   north   base of the most
  northern kaim,      BAC, there         were   boulders piled over one another.
  On studying       these,     I   became    impressed with the belief that             the
  uppermost boulder, being the last which came, should show                             the
  quarter from which it must have come, to get into its position.
     Diagrams on Plate         XII.    represent    these   cases, showing      that    the
  boulders had come from some northerly point.*
     There was one place              where rocks in situ of grey granite            were
  found    smoothed     ;    the    smoothed      face   being towards        the north,
  and   a  boulder     lying on that         side.    The farther progress         of the
  boulder    to the south           had    been    apparently     obstructed     by     the
  smoothed rocks.         This     case is shown by fig. 1, Plate       XII.

   On several occasions subsequently,           I   examined       the hanks and
boulders, occupying        the district    on the east       side of the Kiver
Spean, and situated to the north of the spot on the Ordnance                    Map
called "Bough Burn."          (See B on the Sketch Map, Plate XL)
   I  found several,      and especially two remarkable            kaims, running
in  a somewhat       different   direction   from     those   on the west side
of the valley, viz., towards         south*   and curving        like the    rest, —
with the inner curve facing the west.                I  walked      along the top
of the two highest kaims.           Their sides were      steep, and reached       in
some spots to a height         of 30 to 40 feet, with many boulders on
them.
   These kaims occupy portions of the hill, which slopes up towards
the north, from about 1100 to 1245 feet above sea-level.
   Standing    on   these   kaims,   I  could descry Loch Treig, which by
compass    bears  from them about S.S.W.             The leVel of the loch is
represented in the Ordnance Map as 784 feet above sea-level.
   Some of the boulders, on the level ground in several parts of
the valley, form trainees, more or less parallel with the lines of the
kaims.
   The following     are the dimensions of some         of the boulders on the
east side  of the valley    :—
      One measured in girth        19 paces, and    in height     5 feet.
      Another measured        12 x   3x2 feet, with longer          axis S.W.
                              15x10x4 feet,               „               „
   It  is proper to add,    that shelf IV., before referred        to as the beach
line of the lowest lake, is visibly impressed on the gravel banks,
on both sides of the valley ; and they are so indicated on the
Ordnance Map.
   These    kaimsj    therefore,   belong    to   a   period    in history more
ancient than the Lochaber lakes.
                                      theory,
    With regard to the origin of        these banks and boulders, there can
be little or no doubt that the materials of the banks, consisting
chiefly of well-rounded        pebbles and blocks, and         in    some   cases of
sand, in beds partially stratified, must be due, in some way, to the
 agency of water, with deep and powerful currents.

    The detritus had assuredly not fallen from the adjoining hills, by
the natural decay of the rocks composing them.
    The    late    Dr MaccuUoch, who                    was    eminent      as     mineralogist,
geologist, and chemist,            visited         Lochaber,         to seek     for data                to
enablehim to try and solve the problem of the parallel roads;
and wrote an elaborate paper on the subject, which was published
in the Transactions of             the    London          Geological       Society     for         1817,
vol. iv.
    He particularly          studied     the nature            of the gravelly          materials
lying     on    the surface of the country, and he                         found       that        these
were of two descriptions.              He   observed          that the debris of the rocks
were   angular in shape: — The other class he called "transported
                                        " and
alluvium of pebbles, sand^ and gravel ;        these, he observed,
generally differed in mineralogioal composition from the rocks of the
hills on which they lay.                " The alluvium
                                                                    (he says) -was not thus
rounded by the action of the water which produced                                the    lines (i.e.,
the parallel roads).          We must        suppose          that this rounded alluvium
had been, by previous causes, accumulated.                          If   this took place from
the action of water (and to what other came                          can tee assign           it   I),   it
must belong to an epoch prior to the deposits of sharp matter in
the upper parts
                "
                  (page 330).
   Again he says — " The conoidal hillocks, occurring between Glen
                        :
Fintec and Glen Giastrie> consist                 of     deposits   of fine   sand,     day, and
rolled stones of different sizes, — disposed in a manner irregularly
stratified, and in       a   direction more or less horizontal.                  The terraces
and hillocks, which occupy positions much inferior to these,                               all       the
way along         Ute    course   of   the Spean, are           of    the same         materials"
(page 339).
    The hillocks in Glens              Fintec     and Glastrie, here mentioned as
examples        of " transported alluvium," occupy positions exceeding
1200 feet above the sea, and are (MaccuUoch says) the same kind
of deposits as those along the course of the Spean, referring, no
doubt, to the kaims described in this paper.
    Examples of these detrital              deposits occur in all the Lochaber
glens.     In     Roy and its lateral valleys, there are cliffs of
                  Glen
boulder clay, exceeding 200 feet in depth. Along the course of the
Spean at Murlaggan,           on the east bank, there are cliffs of sand, par
tially stratified horizontally,        above 80 feet deep; and on the west side,

at Alt^na-Bruach, there        are cliffs   of mixed sand and gravel, equally
deep, all more or loss stratified.
   The River Treig, near its exit from the loch, has cut through
banks of gravel, also stratified, exceeding 70 feet in depth.
   It  may be added that any one passing through                     the Caledonian
Canal, near Banavie, may see great gashes on the                  Moy Hills to the
north, occurring in enormous         beds of white sand, at a height         of 2000
feet above sea-level
   Mr Jamiesou         of   Ellon examined the whole of this district
carefully, and mentions that at the outlet of Loch Treig he found
" strife running    horizontally     along the face of the rocks up to 2000
feet;" and he     adds,   "not that      I  affirm even this to be their upper
limit."     He mentions        similar     features,   even     as   high   as   3055
feet above the sea,        " which                  raise   a suspicion    that some
                                       (ho says)
denuding agent has jUrwed over it at a period geologically recent."
(Lond. Geol.     Soe.  Journal, 26th Feb. 1862,           p. 172.)
   In   these circumstances*     it  seems impossible to doubt           that the sea
has flowed over the whole of this district, and in such a way as to
bring detritus of sand,      mud>     gravel, and boulders, and deposit them
alike on hills and in valleys.         The detritus which forms the kaims in
the Spean valley, which       I have been describing,         must therefore almost
certainly have been brought and deposited there by oceanic agency.
   The gravel banks or kaims of the Spean valley               are not unexampled
in many other parts of Scotland.             In Linlithgowshire a gravel bank,
with steep sides, runs from Polmont eastward, nearly two miles
continuously,     with occasional bends, and is now cut             across at several
points    by small rivers.       In Haddingtonshire            a   similar  east  and
west kaim      runs for     about a quarter        of a mile.         In Nairnshire
there is a similar      kaim, traceable for       a  greater    distance.    In Ber
wickshire,   on Greenlaw Muir, at a height of about 1000 feet above
the sea, there is a gravel bank, high and steep, about three miles in
length, presenting several considerable bends                in its  course, and cut
across by two small streams.
   In    consulting   the Admiralty         Maps,    which show the forms of
submarine     sandbanks,       I  find    many examples          running for more
than a mile continuously,           and, in one case, a bank curved into
almost a semicircle.         Off the mouth of the Thames, where the
tidal currents are strong, there are several such cases.

 920                  Proceedings     of  the  Royal Society
    When Scotland was        submerged,      the currents in this region wocM
 probably be rapid, looking       to the relative positions        of the    hills    and
valleys.
    If  the question be thought of any importance, it may be noticed
 on the Map, Plate       XL,  that this part of the Spean valley is so sur
 rounded by hills, as to be an area well fitted for the reception                    and
 detention of detritus, its diameter being about three miles.
    Moreover,   it is worthy of notice that        the valley   in which this area
 occurs is contracted at its north end, so that            if  a current flowed at
 that end, towards the Spean valley,                it would enter the Taller
 with considerable velocity, and          in  virtue of the way in which it
 is surrounded by hills, it might acquire a circular motion, producing
whirlpools or    eddies.
    It will    be   found,    on   consulting       the   contour     lines      of  the
 one-inch Ordnance Map, that whilst the space where the kaims and
 boulders are situated is (between the contour lines of 1250 feet)
 three miles across, the breadth of the valley to the north,
between     the same      contour lines, is only          li  miles     (see     Sketch
Map, Plate      XL).      To the north         of    this  gorge    there      is open
 country, and at     a  low level  ; so    that  if the country was then            sub
merged there would be opportunity              for  a large   body of water flow
 ing through the     gorge towards the south.
    Now it is allowable here       to observe that there are strong reasons
 for   believing    that   when    Scotland       was    submerged a          powerful
 current, with floating ice from some north-westerly point, did pre
 vail  here, as probably elsewhere          in Scotland.      A   few of the facts
 bearing on this point may be mentioned.
    (I)  The most important of the lateral glens joining Glen Spean
 is Glen Roy, which runs for about 16 miles towards its head or
 col in a S.E. direction.        I  extract the following paragraph from
 the notes taken by me when         I  visited this glen in 1846         : — '* Visited
 head of Glen Roy.        In  upper Glen Roy it is interesting to obeervr
 how uniformly the smoothed           surfaces   of rocks    are to the tc^et, and
 their  rough faces to the east."
    As this is  a point   of some importance,         I confirm    my own observa
 tion by a quotation from the Memoir of Mr Jamieson of Ellon, who,
with a view to the
                          " Parallel Roads " problem, made an elaborate
survey of all the Lochaber glens.              Near the top of Glen Roy,              b*

                       oj Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                             921
 says (Lond. Geol. Society's Proceedings, vol. xviii. p. 296) — " was          I
 not a little surprised to find that the ice had come from the S.W>,
 i.e., up Glen       Roy.    .....      The strata had       been    so blunted and
 rubbed on their S. W. txposures as to show plainly that the move
 ment came from that quarter j and high up on the brow of the
 adjoining hill      I  saw several very large blocks and boulders                that
 appeared     to have been shifted       or moved some distance          .....      by
 glacial action*"
      Mr Jamieson      suggests     that this rubbing of the rocks, on their
 S.W.     exposures,   was due to "glacial action."            If ice  moved up the
 glen it could not have been glacier, but floating ice.
      (2) In Glen Gluoy Valley, adjoining Glen Roy, and opening liko
 it towards the west, similar proofs exist of a movement up the glen,
 from the westward (see "Memoir on Parallel Roads,"                       Edinburgh
 Royal Society Transactions, vol. xxviL p. 638).*
      (3) Craig Dhu,      a  hill situated on the  east side    of the  gorge before
 mentioned, reaches         to a height of 2100       feet-,  and presents several
 spots near the summit on its N.W.               side, where the edges of the
 strata show smoothing           from the north.       The boulders on the hill
are also chiefly on the north slopes.
     (4) Ben Ghlinaig is a hill on the west side of the gorge, reaching
to a height of 2545 feet. Mr Jolly of Inverness informed me that
on its eastern       slope he found rock striations at a height of              1 840
feet,    running   KW;      and S.E.
     (5)   In the gorge itself, near its lowest level,           some   of the rocks
present large smooth ings facing             the north,      and grooves of great
length, evidently        caused    by violent and      severe    friction of heavy
bodies which had moved over the rocks.
     (6) Then on the        N.W. shoulder of Ben Nevis, at the mouth of
    *
       As these pages were being printed, I received from my old and esteemed
friend, Colin Livingston of Fort-William, a letter (dated 23rd September 1884)
narrating an excursion he had a few days previously made to Olen Oluoy, and
mentioning that at a height of about 1760 feet above the sea he had found
several granite boulders on the side of a hill facing the west, and lying on
quartzite rocks, which Were smooth on their west sides and rough on their east
sides.     He adds that three of these boulders formed a line or trainie of abou
a 100 to 120 yards.      He became satisfied, from these facts, that the boulders
had come up the glen from the westward, and not down the glen, as he had
previously supposed.       The nearest locality for granite rocks, known to him,
is " Meallan-Suidhe,"      situated some miles to the westward.

  922                   Proceedings     of the Royal    Society
  a glen called     Carry N'Eoin,     I  found,    at two different    spots, rocki
  so striated    as to show     that the striating agent had          moved from
  N.X.W.,     i.e., in the direction of the Spean valley*
     (7) In  the Spean valley itself there are at least            a docen placet
 where the rocks by the marks on them distinctly show severe pressure
 and friction by some body passing over them in a S.E. direction.4
     (8) Reference having been made to terraces or banks of detritus
 on the slopes of the hills to the south of Lock Treig, up to a height
 of about 1400 feet above the              sea,  it is proper to mention that
 similar banks of detritus occur on the hills to the north, and at about
  much the same level.
     On Chlinaig       Hill (before referred to) there are two such banks         it
  a height above the sea of 1253 feet and 1373 feet
     The hill on the opposite or       east side   of this valley shows similar
 banks, and along which         I  walked at rather a lower level.
     It  appeared to me that         these   had very probably been formed
 when the land was submerged.               They   are essentially different   from
 the old lake beaches, in respect of their want of horizontality.
     (9) Lastly,    I refer to the fact,   that almost at the very tops of the
 highest adjoining hills great boulders are found, and in such positions
 as to show     that they could not have         come there except      by floating
 ice.    Thus,    Darwin refers to the boulders on the top of hills in
 Lochaber,      at the heights of 1700 and 2200 feet above sea-level
 On the tops of two hills adjoining Loch Laggan, exceeding 3000 feet
 above the sea,      I was informed by Sir John Ramsden of Ardverikie,
 the proprietor       of these hills, that there are several large granite
 boulders.
    Whilst expressing my own opinion that the kaiins and boulders
 in the valley near the junction of the Rivers Spean and Treur
 indicate   the agency of the sea,            it is proper to advert to the
 opinion of my geological friend, Mr Jamieson of Ellon, that these
 are    the moraines      of  a   glacier which,     generated    in Glen Triieg.
 advanced into and crossed the Spean valley.
    Mr Jamieson adopted the view originally suggested by AgassLr,
 that the barriers of all the old Lochaber           lakes consisted of ice.      It
 being necessary to find a barrier for the Glen Roy Lake not                   only
   * These
            places are named in the

Prestwick and me respectively.

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84                                       92:5
at the foot of the glen, but at the head of Glen Glaster,                   Mr Jamieson
saw that the only way of obtaining            an ice barrier at this last-men
tioned place was to assume           the existence of        a   glacier in Glen Treig,
which he supposed would descend into and                         cross    the valley, then
rise up on the opposite side of the valley near the Rough                        Bum, and
next make     a   nearly right-angled       wheel towards Glen Glaster, dis
tant from Loch Treig no less than 6 miles                !
  I   am afraid     that    I   must agree with Professor Prestwick                    (Phil.
Trans,   of Royal Society of London for 1879, p. 668) in the opinion
he has    expressed, that the
                                " Glen Treig glacier would be in
competent    to the task assigned to        it"     by   Mr Jamieson.              Professor
Prestwick observes, that to block             Glen Glaster col the "glacier
would have to       cross   Glen Spean, and after that travel                2 miles      with
a rise of not less than 500 feet."
   I agree   with the Professor       (page 684), that           if   there was a glacier
from Glen Treig, which protruded into the valley,                        it would, instead
of ascending the slopes on the opposite or east side of the valley,
have followed the natural levels of the valley, and flowed down to
wards the north-west.
   Whilst Mr Jamieson's primary object in suggesting                         a   Glen Treig
glacier was to find a barrier for the head of Glen Glaster, he also
availed himself       of the services of this glacier for explaining                        the
origin of the kaims and boulders, which form the subject of the
present paper.
   One fatal objection          to this view, as     it appears to           me,    is,    that
the materials composing these kaims are not such as characterise
moraines.    They are what Macculloch properly calls " rounded
alluviumf formed by the action of water                  ;       whereas the materials
of moraines being merely the debris of rocks, which fall on the
surface of the glacier by meteoric agency, are totally different                             in
character.
   Another objection to this view             is,   that the lines of kaims                  in
the valley lie to the south of the march which any glacier from
Loch Treig would take.                To   meet     this obvious difficulty,                Mr
Jamieson     says   that " the glacier on issuing from the narrow                         gorge
at the end of Loch Treig dilated              immensely ;"               so that its      right
flank might carry materials to the position occupied by the kaims and
 boulders.   think that
             I              the glacier underwent such an immense
                                if

924                     Proceedings     of the Royal Society
dilatation,    it would fall      to pieces altogether    in the valley, before   it
could reach the position of the kaiins.
   At the    same time,      I am far from denying that        Mr Jamieson      had
good grounds for supposing that a small glacier existed             in Glen Treig,
and that it even probably protruded a little way into the valley.
   In his map he indicates glacial stria; at a point where they may
have been caused          by a glacier from Loch Treig.         I saw  these striae,
(Notes,    vol.   i. p.    8),  vit, on     masses     of rock which had       been
smoothed      and partially striated from the westward.               Most of the
rock was covered and concealed            by detritus, which, on being cleared
away by me, showed the smoothed surface of the rock.                           The
explanation which occurred to me at the time was, that after these
rocks had been so smoothed and striated the country became sub
merged,     and the whole valley was filled with submarine beds of
gravel, sand, and boulders.           The spot now referred to is near that
           "            "
marked        Ft rsit on the one-inch Ordnance Map (Sketch Map,
Plate  XL).
   Whilst offering my opinion, that               these  kaims   is Spean valley
are submarine detritus, and have been scoured                out into long banks
by the action of sea currents,              I   acknowledge    that they deserve
much more examination              than   I   had the opportunity       of giving;
and   I trust   others who are interested in these researches will visit
the locality, and publish the results of their inspection.

   In   the   Fifth Report       (page 23) of the Boulder Committee it is
                      "  at Borve, on the west coast of Harris, about half
mentioned that
way between Kodel and Tarbert, there is a remarkable accumulation
of boulders on the side of the            hill sloping down to the      sea.   The
general    slope    of the    hill (which     reaches   a height  of 800 feet) is
towards W. by N. (magnetic).              The rocks are of gneiss, and present
a series of    beds, layers,    or benches more or less horizontal, forming
as it were a gigantic staircase along the hill face,
                                                                 for about half a
mile, all more or less covered by boulders.               These benches of rock,
in many places, show that they have been rounded by severe pres
sure from W. by N.             Many of the boulders which lie on them also
give evidence of transport from the west."

    Two figures      are appended      to the Committee's    Fifth Keport, to
illustrate these facts.
    But  I happen     to have in my possession     a more graphic representa
tion of the locality, which        I  now exhibit to the Society.        It  was
made,    at my request, by a London             landscape-painter,  who     was
taking views at Harris, and         whose acquaintance   I happened   to make,
by residing in the same inn with him.             He and   I  on one occasion
travelled together in the same conveyance, a,nd had to bait our horse
at Borve,     near which the         hill occurs.    He saw    me  vainly    en
deavouring     to make in my sketch-book a drawing of the          hill  ; and,
at my request, he wa# so kind as to give a representation               of the
place in my sketch-book, which          I now reproduce  (Plate  XIII.  fig. 2).
It   shows how numerous the boulders are on the hill-slope, and that
they had found lodgment on the ledges             of gneiss rocks which pro
trude from the hilL
    I give  also  a  representation of one of the boulders (Plate XIII.
fig. 3), firmly lodged on the projecting strata of the hill. ; its east end
abutting    against the strata in such a way as to show that it had
probably come from the westward.
    The interest of the locality arises from the circumstance that the
hill on which       those  boulders lie slopes down in a westerly direc
tion to the Atlantic Ocean       ; so that  if the boulders on the   hill  came
from    the westward, as       I  think they did, they must have           been
transported from some land bordering on the Atlantic.

                                                                                     "
         Basins.      By Hugh Robert            Mill, B.Sc, F.C.S.           Com-
         municated by Professor Crum Brown.                    (Plate XIV.)
    The periodic variations of the temperature of water have been
studied for some months at the Scottish Marine Station at Granton.
The only tidal basin which has been considered                     as  yet is the
haven formed by the irruption of the sea into Granton Quarry.                    It
has an area of about 7 acres ; the tidal entrance is on the west side,
and is so situated that no water can enter until about half tide                   ;
then it comes in as a very rapid stream for about three-quarters of
an hour, when the rate falls off, and near high water              it is the  same
as that   of the rising tide on the        shore.    The ebb is gradual until
the tide has narrowed          the channel by uncovering          the sandbanks
which lie on      each side  of  the entrance, then     it is rapid for about   an
hour and    a  half, after which the water runs out extremely slowly, and
 does not absolutely cease       until the tide begins to re-enter       ; but for
from four to five hours the water-level inside is practically unaltered.
The depth of the quarry at low water            varies from 5 to 8 fathoms       in
 the parts where observations           were made, and at high water the
 depth is slightly more than        1  fathom greater.       The bottom shelves
 off abruptly from the bar at the entrance.
    The variation of water temperature naturally divides itself into
 two periods — annual and diurnal.            The former can only be ascer
tained by daily observations continued            for several    years, and such
observations      of both surface and        bottom    temperature were com
menced in May           1884, and     are   being   continued.       The diurnal
variations     may be investigated       by continuous      hourly observations
for   a number      of entire days.     Such series of hourly, and in some
cases   half-hourly, observations were made twice in the month of
June for periods of thirty-six hours         each, and once     in the beginning
of   July    for   twenty-five    hours,   and   some    interesting   facts were
brought out by this means.
    It  was made      evident in some preliminary trials that the Miller-
Casella thermometer         was not adapted for rapid work in shallow
water.     It  requires to be immersed from ten to fifteen minutes in

  order to acquire the temperature of its surroundings ; when                        drawa
  up from depths under 10 fathoms, the mercury has not had time                            to
  recede from the      index, and before it can be read               evaporation      from
  the wet bulb       lowers     the temperature          and renders         the   reading
  inaccurate.
     Sir Robert Christison's cistern thermometer gave good results,
 but it is too heavy an instrument to use rontinuously for many
  hours.
     For  the   first two sets of observations about                  to be     described
 Negretti and Zambra's patent deep-sea thermometer with Magnaghi's
 frame was used.         The instrument is constructed so that after it has
 acquired the temperature           of the water it may be turned over ; on
 this being done the mercury which has passed out of the bulb runs
 into the upper part of the tube which is now lowermost,                          and can
 be measured      by means of      a scale   of degrees when the instrument is
 drawn up.       Tt contains only one           fluid— mercury      ;   and experiment
 has shown that three         minutes are sufficient to enable              it to acquire
 the temperature,      although in our observations it was customary to
 allow   four    or five minutes as          a    minimum      to make sure.          The
 reversing arrangement         of Magnaghi         resembles    a screw-propeller ;       it
 is turned on drawing          the   instrument        up through       the    water and
 releases the thermometer, which              then turns over, as its pivots are
 below the      centre     of gravity      and it never        hangs      quite   perpen
 dicularly.     The objection to the method is that in shallow places
 the temperature at the bottom cannot be obtained, since the reversing
 screw   will  not act    in much      less than a fathom        of water under the
 most favourable       circumstances,       and usually     it requires considerably
 more.     A modification of the thermometer              was accordingly designed
 by Professor Chrystal and myself, and the necessary alterations were
 made    in  a   most     satisfactory manner by           Mr Frazer of Lothian
 Street.
    The Scottish thermometer-frame,               as  the improved form has been
 named, differs from Magnaghi's by the removal of the screw and fans
from the pin that holds the thermometer in position, and the substi
tution in their place of        a lever kept down by a spiral spring.                  The
lever is forked at the outer end to allow the line to which the ther
mometer     is attached     to pas3 between.           In order   to prevent the line
from slipping       out of the fork, it is clasped             by two thin springs

which rise from                   a projecting          horse-shoe-shaped piece beneath the
lever.          A hollow cylindrical                  weight slightly belled out at the lower
end is dropped                    down       the line when                 the thermometer               is to be
reversed ; it falls on the forked                          lever, raises the pin, the upper end
of the instrument                  gets       an outward           impulse            from an india-rubber
baud slipped over the frame                           (a     device of          Mr Buchanan's), and it
rotates sharply, and is clamped by                            a   brass spring.               When several of
these thermometers are used on one line, as is convenient in taking
serial temperatures, the weight                             for the next lower instrument                          is
hung by          a wire to the groove                   in the top         ;   it helps to pull the ther
mometer over when released, then sliding down the line it strikes
the lever of the next,                       reverses      it,   and despatches its weight.                        In
this way any number of instruments                                      may       be used on one line.
The ends of the lever forks                     are covered        with india-rubber to diminish
the shock, and the whole apparatus                                is   constructed of brass, so that
no galvanic action can be set up between any of its parts.
   The adaptation                   of       the Negretti          and         Zambra         thermometer          to
reverse by means of                     a    weight        slipped      down the line              is   not new.
Mr     Rung,          of     the        Meteorological            Institute            of    Copenhagen,          has
invented         a   very simple method of doing this                                  ;    but, although         his
frame has worked                   admirably in his hands,                      it    has the disadvantage
of being constructed of wood.                            A    simpler arrangement for the same
purpose was employed on the United States ship
                                                                                        " Fish Hawk;" but,
                                                it,
from the account given of                       it       seems       to be inferior to the Scottish
frame, in not clamping                        the instrument               when reversed.               The new
thermometer                was made before the description                                  of either of     these
earlier forms was seen.                        It   has been found                to answer admirably,
both in very shallow water and in depths up to 80 fathoms.
  The first          set    of observations was made hourly during                                a     period of
thirty -six hours, from                  9   a.m. on     June 17th to             9    p.m. on    June 18th.

    The      observations         included      two     complete      tides,    and     it    to
observed that when the water began to enter at 6 p.m. the bottco
temperature began to rise from                   54°- until at      9 p.m.   it reached       55'.
The surface temperature was meanwhile                           falling.     The night wit
cloudy, and from           9 p.m. to 6 A.M.         the readings of the surface               and
bottom thermometers were practically the same.                            At  6 a.m. the tide
began to enter, and the bottom temperature fell slowly from 55:
to 54°"6.        The whole of the next day was dull and cloudy, and the
temperatures of air and of water varied little. The tidal effect observed
was somewhat puzzling, for the temperature of the water of the Firth
 was known by previous observations                        to be several degrees lower
than that in the quarry, and not to vary appreciably with the hour.
     In order to get additional evidence, the 25th and 26th                          June    were
 selected     for another        series   of observations.          The 25th was cloudy
 and cool, the air temperature being altogether                           below the
 for the two days, the night was pretty                     clear, and      the 26th
 out bright and warm.                As  I had more assistance           than on the
 occasion, observations were made every half hour at three stations
 in different parts of the quarry — one near the month where                                   the
 depth at low water is 5 fathoms, the second was the                                  Ark in      6
 fathoms, the third a buoy                in the north-west corner in               8

      The course of the temperature curves                      at the    Ark on      t
  days is shown        in Plate XIV., where the tidal               effect is  plainly notice
  able.     The observations           embraced     three complete tides.            When       the
  water began to enter at noon, there was a steady rise of                               1
  temperature, and when               it entered at      1  a.m. next day there
  distinct     a fall ;   while on its coming in at 1.30                 p.m.  a very abrupt
  rise of almost a degree was observed at each of the stations.                               The
  curve of surface temperature followed that of air temperature                            in  the
 main, as on the previous day.

   The improved        thermometer         having been      constructed and tested
in the interval,     a set of     hourly observations       was made at the three
stations during a period of twenty-five hours, from 9 a.m. on                   July     3rd
to  10 a.m. on     July 4th        The temperature was taken at the surface
and the bottom as on previous occasions,              and also at a point midway
between the two.
   The third was a hot clear day, but the sky clouded in the evening,
and    rain   fell very heavily         during the entire night.              A      severe
thunderstorm was experienced from               11 p.m.    on the 3rd to 4.30 a.m.
on the 4th.         The continual        dazzling    produced      by    the lightning
flashes made it difficult to read the thermometers with accuracy, but
there is reason to believe that no serious error was made, and the
observations were carried on regularly.
   On the third the surface temperature               was   high, and the interme
diate curve remained close to the bottom one, until 5 p.m., when it
rose   rapidly.     During the night and on the forenoon of the 4th,
the temperature varied but little, and the curves for the surface,
bottom, and half depth interlace each other curiously.                       A    distinct

   In   order to eliminate the tidal effect as much as possible,                   a  moan
was taken of the hourly results of the first and second series                        ;   the
tides, being at opposite phases at the same hour, annul each other
to   a   certain     extent.      The     surface     temperature       curve      in the
diagram, representing the result of tidal elimination,                  follows the air
curve very closely;        the     bottom curve also does           so,   though        to a
much      slighter    extent, and      the phase is        clearly    retarded.          The
accurate curves embodying              all the results have been laid on the
table.

     It    is obviously unsafe to generalise from such a small numbei
of observations, but the results brought out by the discussion                                    of
the figures may be stated as at least probably true                       :—
     (1) During daylight the air was always at a higher temperature
          than the water, but after sunset the water was warmer than
            the air     ;    and taking    an average for the whole period, the
            mean temperature of the air was the higher.
     (2) The surface temperature followed                     that of the air,       and was
            little   affected    by tidal changes.
     (3) The bottom temperature followed that of the air, but the
          crest of the heat wave was retarded by several hours, and
            the curve was profoundly modified by the tides.
     (i)    The      temperature was, higher            at the surface than            at the
            bottom during         the day    ;   but, as a rule,     it   was   higher at the
            bottom than at the surface by night.
     (5) When the tide flowed in the early morning it exercised                                   a
         cooling effect on the bottom thermometers, but when                                   it
            flowed at other times          it produced        a warming effect.
     The variations of temperature when the tidal                     effect    is eliminated
may be accounted               for by the direct action of sun heat and radia
tion, propagated by conduction and convection beneath the surface.
It   is possible that when the tide enters the quarry after the sand
over       which it must flow to reach the entrance has been exposed
for several hours to strong sun-heat, the water may be warmed by
contact      with     it,   and so exert   a     heating effect.     On the other hand,
when the sand has been uncovered by night, chilled by radiation,
it   may cool the water passing over                    it,    or at least not raise its
temperature.            This hypothesis explains all the phenomena which we
have observed as yet, and             is   supported by       a   considerable number of
experiments;          but     Mr Peddie and      I   are about to commence         a   critical
               its applicability, and also to investigate the varia
research to test
tions produced by the currents in the quarry, the direction of the
wind, and other causes.

 8.   On the Isothermals          and Adiabatics of         Water near the
         Maximum Density Point.               By Mr W. Peddie.              Com
         municated by Professor Cram Brown.
    The state of water,       as regards pressure,     volume,      temperature,
 entropy, and energy, may be represented by surfaces in                a number
 of ways, depending upon which of the properties we              choose   to have
 their numerical values measured off along the'axes to which the surface
 is referred.    The surface most suited for the consideration             of the
 forms of the isothermals      and adiabatics is that one the co-ordinates
 of  each   point of which represent    pressure,  volume, and temperature.
 The nature of this surface         as constructed   for  water,   and some of
 its peculiar features, were first studied by Professor James Thomson,
 and described by him in a communication              made to this Society.
 Designating     pressure,  volume, and temperature by the letters p, v, t,
 the isothermals      are the projections    upon the plane (p, v) of the
 lines of intersection      of planes of constant temperature with the
 surface.     The adiabatics    are the projections,    upon the same plane
 of curves laid down upon the surface, such that,            as the substance
 passes   from one state     to another as represented by points on the
 curve,    it does   so  without absorption     or emission      of heat.     The
 actual curve upon the surface may he termed the complete adia-
 batic.     The chief features of the projection of      the surface upon the
 plane (p, t) are three curves, which separate the regions representing
the liquid, solid, and gaseous states.          These three curves meet in
a point, which Professor       J.  Thomson terms the triple point.          If we
 measure pressure downwards           and   temperature     to the    right,  the
curve separating the liquid and gaseous           regions slopes downwards
from this point towards the right.           The curve separating the solid
and     gaseous   regions slopes upwards       towards the     left, making     a
greater angle with the t axis       ; while the other curve slopes down
wards towards the left, and is very much steeper.              The maximum-
density curve slopes downwards           to the left, but is not nearly        so
steep as the liquid solid curve which it meets at      a  point corresponding
to a pressure of nearly three tons weight per square inch.         It also meets
the liquid-gaseous curve.        Inside the triangular    region so bounded
the substance is liquid, and the quantity          ^   has a negative value.

For the liquid condition outside this region                                       is positive.            Henc*,
                                                                             at
 from       the third         thermodynamics!                relation, we               find    that in         this
 triangular region the adiabatics slope downwards towards the left
for       increased          pressure ;         while    in the other               region they              slope
downwards               towards      the right.           So      if   we     take a portion               of    the
substance          in    a state corresponding to a point                          in the region where
-£ is      negative,         and allow      it to expand adiabatically, its temperature
rises.       From calculations based upon the first and third thermo-
dynamical relations,                it   seems that the slope of the adiabatics in                              this
region is not so steep as the slope of the maximum-density curve.
Hence        we     have adiabatics               meeting this               curve.            But    no     such
adiabatic can pass into the region where                                       has a positive value,
                                                                       ^
since the maximum-density                        curve slopes upwards toward the right
It    must be determined by experiment then, whether the adiabatic
coincides with this curve after meeting                                it,    or   if    it    re-enters        the
original region, its slope having become steeper.                                       In either     case      we
can      have     two adiabatics intersecting                 ;   that       is,   at   a   given tempera
ture, volume, and pressure,                      we may have water near the maximum-
density point, in at least                       two states differing               in the amount of
intrinsic       energy        possessed.           If   the adiabatics coincide with the
maximum-density curve, we may have an infinite                                           number of such
states.
     Now consider            a     portion of the substance                   in   a    state represented
by         point        in   the     region when                  is   positive.               On adiabatic
      a

expansion the temperature falls until the maximum-density curve
is   reached.           After this, the           temperature          rises.           Hence there          is   a
point of minimum                   temperature upon the adiabatic.                               This point
must be         looked         upon        as    one     in which            two        adiabatics         meet
Probably the course                 of each adiabatic meeting in one point on the
curve (i.e., the adiabatics whose                       previous courses have been in the
region of negative and positive                           values for                     respectively),          is
                                                                                ^
different on further expansion.                          The amount of intrinsic energy
possessed,        determines which                 region the course                will       pass   into on
adiabatic compression                    from such       a    point.          Th\9       is    equivalent        to

saying that lines      so  meeting are different adiabatics, — not branches
of the same one.
   As Mr Riicker (Pivc. Roy. Soc, vol. xxii.)                  has pointed      out,   it
is possible    that there may be         a point of maximum temperature on
the adiabatics    within     the region where ^£ is negative,           for the sub-
stance is rising    in temperature,        while doing work by its expansion.
This must     be determined by experiment.
    In the surface referred      to above, there are three cylindrical        regions,
the projections of which on the plane (p, t) give the three curves
already mentioned as separating the regions which represent the three
different states.      The triple point line is the line of intersection of
these surfaces.      Mr Riicker shows that, along             the triple point    line,
and    along all other isothermals in these cylindrical                 regions,     the
adiabatics coincide        for some distance with the isothermals.                   lie
gives formula; for determining             the  distances for which        they coin
cide.     Consider    portions of       the   substance in       the three different
conditions, such      that the state of the mixture is represented                by    a
point on the triple-point          line.     If there   is enough steam        to  just
melt all the ice, the adiabatic and isothermal will coincide all along
the triple-point     line in the direction of lessening volume.                If  not,
then the adiabatic will enter the liquid-solid surface.                If more than
enough, then it will enter the liquid-gaseous surface.                    On    expan
sion, the lines will        only coincide until all the water disappears,
when the adiabatic        will  enter the solid-gaseous       surface.
   If  with    Professor     J. Thomson we consider             that portion     of an
isothermal      where     change     of state    occurs    to   be  curved in       the
plane (p, v), so     as   to have     parts corresponding to unstable condi
tions,   there   must always         be   more   unstable conditions        along an
isothermal in the region separating the liquid and gaseous states
than in the other two similar regions             ; or else there are more such
unstable conditions in that region near the triple point line than at
a distance from it.

      The President gave            a   short Review of the Session, and
                added some closing Remarks as follows                  : —
    The President said — This session of the Royal                  Society',   not the
least interesting        or remarkable       of the series, is now about to close.
I  have been furnished with             a  statement of the papers which have
been     read,   which exhibits      a   creditable   amount of industry as well
as  of ability among its members. It seems that of these 16 were
in Natural Philosophy, 15 in Mathematics, 6 in Geology, 2 in
Chemistry,       6   in Mineralogy, 6 on Meteorology, 2 in Spectroscopic
Astronomy,        4 in Natural History, 5 on Botany, 5 in Physiology,

   We have sustained           some    severe   losses by death     in the    course of
the Session.          Two very celebrated men, whom            we had the honour
to number among the foreign Honorary Fellows of                           the Society,
died within        a  few weeks of each other — M. Dumas, the Perpetual
Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences, having                       died on the
4th of    April 1884; and M. Adolphe Wurtz, his friend and fellow-
labourer, who pronounced             a funeral     oration on his death, having
himself     died on the 12th of May.              Both   these   distinguished     men
were renowned throughout             Europe for the invaluable           contributions
they had made to Chemical Science, and specially to that branch of
it known      as Organic Chemistry,          in regard  to which    M. Dumas may
be said to have         initiated  a new departure.         He was born in 1800

in Genoa, and had therefore at his death reached the patriarchal             age
of   84.    The value of his services during that long life to the         cans*
to which it was devoted        it is impossible to over-estimate.       Similar
honour is due to M. Wurtz, not only for his valuable labours in tht
same branch of Chemical         Science, but from his numberless publica
tions and discoveries within the whole circle of chemical knowledge!
" It   was   his good fortune,"    says  M. Friedel, in    a funeral address,
" as   rare  as well-merited,   that in the midst of such      a multitude of
                                                                                 '
 different investigations,    he never saw one of his results questioned.

as Perpetual      Secretary of the Academy of Sciences, which had long
been an object of his ambition.
    Among ourselves, we have lost          some very eminent      and familiar
 names, to which, on the present occasion,          I  cannot do more than
allude.      They will  be  duly commemorated afterwards.         At  the head
of the list stands that of the late Duke of . Buccleuch.          I have   indi
 vidually taken another opportunity of expressing my appreciation
and respect for the memory of that distinguished man, to whom
 Scotland     lies under a heavy debt of obligation, and who         will   long
 be remembered throughout         its length and breadth as one     of its most
 illustrious benefactors.       Even had he not       possessed  these distin
  guished titles to our grateful remembrance, the fact that he was the
 lineal representative of the first President of the Society would have
given him a claim on our interest.          The three other names on the
 list furnished to    me were personal friends of my own,        two of them
 school-fellows    whom    I had  known from boyhood.
     The first is that of Professor John Hutton Balfour, who was                 a
  Fellow of the Royal Society for fifty years, a Professor of Botany
 in the University of Edinburgh for thirty-four years, and Secreurr
  of this Society for nineteen years. It is needless for. me to speak to
 you, who knew him so well, of his kindly genial manner, his deTotxaa
 to scientific pursuits, which began       with his boyish days, and neTer
 quitted him during his long and useful life ; and the clear discern
  ing capacity, which enabled him to attain and retain the confident*
 of all who came in contact with him. Nor need I attempt to recount
 the valuable services which he rendered to the progress of that branch
 of science to which his life was chiefly devoted.
    The second name is that of Allen Thomson.            He too  was  a sclhvv

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84.                         939
fellow, and   a man    of very varied accomplishment, and of rare mental
quality.   Perhaps with a harder grain of fibre he might have attained
more general fame, for he was singularly unassuming and gentle, not
from want of intellectual        force, hut from the balance of a refined
nature.    But he     was especially adapted    for the prosecution of exact
science by the clear lucidity of his thoughts, and the quiet impartiality
of his judgment.       As  a companion, he was charming, as he had           rich
resources on     which to draw, and          a  delightful vein of cheerful
humour in which all who knew him rejoiced.
   The last name furnished to         me is that of one who      well deserves
to be commemorated here.           It is that of the well-known Provost of
Leith,   Mr Lindsay.        I am   glad of this opportunity      of expressing
not only my sense of the benefits which his labours have conferred
on the public,       but my own individual feeling of obligation              for
friendly co-operation in important public affairs. The Police Act
which bears his name, and his exertions in which have earned the
gratitude of tho public, was not indeed the last word on the sanitary
legislation for our crowded towns.           But it was the most important
contribution towards it of our day, and        I doubt,  but for  Mr Lindsay's
help,  it might never have      been obtained.      I had  found on previous
attempts that the opinions of the different burghs were so little in
unison, that   it was almost impossible to hope to adjust them within
the compass of      a Session of Parliament.      But in reply to an applica
tion by Mr Lindsay made to myself as Lord Advocate at the time,
to attempt to legislate in this important matter, I said that if he
could obtain a reasonable acquiescence from the burghs in a general
measure,   I should     be glad to aid   in having it passed into law, Mr
Lindsay    accepted    the proposal, and fulfilled his task with an amount
of ability,   tact,   and patience which did him infinite credit, and
deservedly earned for him the distinction which they yielded him.
    The year has been otherwise memorable in more than              one respect.
"We entered our second century; but on that subject               I  sufficiently
enlarged    on a recent occasion.        It  was also distinguished       by the
brilliant and most successful celebration of the Tercentenary of the
University of Edinburgh.           "We had,    during the celebration week,
 the great and rare satisfaction of having          papers read to us by two
 of the Honorary Fellows of the Society — one by Dr Helmholtz of
 Berlin, who has gained       a European    reputation  by his discoveries in

 940                   Proceedings     of the Royal Society
 physics; and Professor Cremona of Rome, whose work on the Theory
 of Projection    has met     with great celebrity, and has been               translated
 into many European          languages.       The Society had also the pieascre
 of hearing an     address     on Cosmic Dust from the Abbe Renard, wbo
 b  not a Fellow of the Eoyal Society, but is known to us by his
 contributions to the records of the " Challenger
                                                               "

    I have    now only to express the hope that the Fellows may meet
 at the commencement          of next Session, recruited for fresh exertions.
    In    connection      with the Tercentenary          celebration,      I    ought    to
 mention that the Council did me the honour to appoint me as Unir
 delegate    to represent the Society on that occasion.                   To my great
 regret,   I  was unable from the 6tate of my health to attend                         the
 celebration, and our Secretary, Professor Tail, was appointed                      in my
 place.     In  the course of the discharge of the duty thus devolved cn
 him, he presented        a  Latin Address from the Royal Society to the
 University, the terms of which were furnished by our Librarian
 Mr   Gordon, and are as follows         : —

                                 Introduction.
   § 1.  In  a  paper
                        * read nearly three years         ago   to this Society,      I
have attempted
   (1) To review the existing state of statistics ;
   (2) To define the nature of the subject, and its relation to history
             and the sciences     ;
   (3) Broadly to group and co-ordinate the whole body of existing
             and possible statistics, in relation              to the respective
             statistical sciences   ;   and
   (4)  In    accordance     with the preliminary sciences to frame                   a
             classification   embracing       all existing    and    possible socio
             logical statistics.     Moreover,
   (5) This was shown to involve, or rather actually to constitute,
             an aspect of the pressing problem of the systematisation
             of the literature of economics, of which
    (6) The existing schools were briefly criticised ;
    (7) The relation of the conceptions of scientific                  economics to
              practical economics was outlined ;
    (8) As also their relation to ethics.
    The present paper proposes to deal with' more attractive                   aspects
of economic        science, and although       inevitably to some extent also
critical, is primarily of systematic and constructive aim.
    § 2. In the domain of all the studies which directly concern man
— in    biology and psychology,           in ethics, politics,      and     economics
alike — it    has   often been pointed out how theoretic conceptions are
subtly, instinctively, almost inextricably interwoven                 with practical
considerations.         Economic      literature   is especially     unfortunate     in
 this respect    ;  in many authors hardly           a sentence is      without this
double     effect.     To eliminate then, and         reserve   for  separate    subse-

 quent criticism, all practical considerations — to distinguish                         dot-trio*
 from    practice, to separate          principle     from precept,           and      constrict
 science   apart from art — is           the   first aim of the           present        inqniry.
 Precisely   as   biology underlies medicine, and astronomy navigation,
 so  sound practical economics can only be profitably                       attempted          after
 sound scientific conceptions have been attained.
    § 3.  The attainment of scientific principles being                       aimed        at, the
 scientific method,       and the scientific method alone, must be used.
 This involves      a  further,    a sterner,    and a far more           difficult     assay of
 economic    literature than the preceding, which aimed exclusively at
 the removal of irrelevant practical matter.                      The influence of other
 extra-scientific conceptions, theological or metaphysical,                          optimistic
 or pessimistic, has also to he guarded against.
    § 4.  Having then successively eliminated                      as   irrelevant        to our
present     purpose the        disturbing      elements        above     referred      to, what
strictly scientific matter remains           1  Much      ;  yet this is in such           a  form
as to  demand      a  new analysis.         For this,       as   in  the preceding paper
on statistics, two postulates are required — (1) the classification of the
sciences, and (2) the main conceptions of each — the comparatively
simple conceptions of physics preceding those of biology                            ; those      of
biology being followed by those of psychology, and these                              again by
sociology.     The elimination of practical and of philosophical considera
tions does not then suffice.              New difficulties were in the first place
shown * to depend not only upon the profound disagreement as to
scope and method            of the subject, but         as    to its very nature,            some
claiming it
                " to be a logical science, others a mathematical, others a
physical, others     a  biological, others a psychological, others               a social, and
others an ethical science ; while some hold                   it  to belong partly to one
of these sciences and partly to another."                Yet      others, as   if the wealth
they are concerned          with   were    not material, and the population                      of
which     they discuss the laws did not consist of living organisms,
practically isolate       it altogether from the                sciences,   even      those of
matter and life.         The economist of literary or legal training assumes
that subtle verbal definition              expanded under the rules of formal
logic will create     a  rigid, universal system.              The mathematician               up
holds the " statistical method," or the expression of economic laws
by algebra     and the calculus.            But the economist of            more     practical

                                                                        " material
wealth — its production, distribution,          and consumption"; giving but
scanty consideration to the nature and wants of the community                    for,
and by which, this wealth is produced, distributed,                and consumed.
Most economists, however,            are so far biologists as to recognise the
physiological      laws made prominent by Malthus.              Psychologists   and
moralists, in insisting upon the estimation of pleasures and pains, or
the analysis of mind and motive, have had no small influence upon
economic theory         ; the historian has now entered the fray, and urges
weighty claims to predominance             ; so too does   the anthropologist   ;  in
short,   it has been attempted to constitute the economic science by
the aid of almost every possible mode and department of scientific
inquiry, and no better evidence of failure              can  be imagined    than is
afforded by the claims of each of these               inco-ordinated   systems to
exclusive success.
    § 5.  Yet we     are bound to assume the        applicability of the  sciences,
and     seeing    that     all have     been   by   turns   applied,  how    is the
" notorious discord and sterility of modern economics " * to be
explained? There are two main reasons for it — first, that the
application      of the sciences       has not been systematic or     in any way
co-ordinated;        secondly,     that although      applied,  their application
has been in almost all cases imperfect or faulty.                The " statistical
           "
method        has been already criticised, and the few applications of
higher mathematics yet made will not              at present be discussed;       but
passing to physics,        it will  at once be evident to any reader, however
little versed in science, that the discussions or definitions of the
nature of " material wealth," of " intrinsic value," and the like,
which     are   to be found at the           outset of almost     every economic
treatise, remain at best in precisely the state in which Smith found
them, and are wholly uninfluenced              by modern physics.      In  biology
too, — while the      law of reproduction discussed by Malthus has become
in the hands of Darwin the foundation-stone                    of that theory of
evolution by natural selection, which has not only revolutionised
modern biology, and with it our views of the origin, nature, and
destiny     of man, but has shed new and brilliant light upon the
special     sciences      which     concern    him,    anthropology,    philology,

psychology,      and ethics, — the economist alone remains             behind.   »a4
although     long ago armed with the purely biological ideas of                 cam
petition    and co-operation, delays to modernise his theories by lie
aid of the new learning,          and treats them as         if they    were    inde
pendent     of such general conceptions of struggle for existence,                  af
functional differentiation        and change, of polymorphism,             and the
like, of which they are really special cases.
    § 6. We see, too, that theories of the mental and mural nature of
man hold a large place in the constructive attempts of many econo
mists, yet probably no one         will seriously maintain that these exten
sive psychological postulates have much in common with any
school of psychology now extant.              Nor do the ordinary economic
postulates as to the structure of society and the origin of its insti
tutions    contain    much which     Mr Spencer, Mr Tylor, or Sir Henry
Maine would recognise as pertaining to modern sociology, bat
rather exhibit a closer affinity (suggestive of direct descent) with
the "Contrat Social"
    § 7.  Enough, then, has probably been said to show that even the
economic systematists who seek to apply scientific                 conceptions      at
all   are unfortunately       provided   for the most part with archaic or
incomplete      ones, when indeed       they are not wholly erroneous         ;   and
 political economy is thus        seen to present     in  a marked     degree that
 lagging behind the general advance of knowledge which not (infre
 quently    occurs even      in the ranks     of the preliminary sciences —
 witness the obsolete chemical notation conserved by mineralogists.
     § 8. Political    economy must        therefore   be   treated    as  a  crcde
 science,  standing     to sociology much as the psychology             of the last
 century    to that now      in  process   of evolution.       Criticism of soch
 provisional    syntheses must be (1) appreciative of them as embryonic
 stages of true science, and for their historical services;                bat (fi
 destructive     where they claim vitality and impede progress.                  Tha
 former is a branch of history proper, the latter of what we nay
 call intellectual palaeontology.        This criticism by     means    of the   pre
  liminary    sciences   is therefore really conservative, since it affords          i
 touchstone for assaying the whole literature of the subject, sentecfe
 by sentence,     if need be.
     Even though the reader may feel contented that                 the particular
system to       which    he happens to have been         trained or attached       t

exhaustive and satisfactory, its usefulness          will really  be to him none
the    less, since the synthesis      which, through this analysis, we shall
ultimately reach must coincide with his own, — thus constituting a
brilliant independent         verification   such as is eagerly sought for in
science, — and so establishing          his position to the exclusion of all
others.
     § 9.   At whatever labour, then, the economist must no longer shrink
from acquainting himself with the preliminary sciences ; the common
objection that he
                         " finds it laborious," or that he " cannot hope to
 become      a  specialist,"   and the like, notwithstanding.          But fortu
 nately     such alarm is groundless,         for no specialist's knowledge is
required.        It will   be found    in the sequel, that just      as the most
 elementary,      if  clear, knowledge     of mathematics, scarcely extending
 in algebra beyond simple equations, nor in geometry beyond the
 construction      of rectangles and curves, is shown in statistical treatises
 to give a new precision          and clearness to conceptions of economic
 quantity     ; so a   similarly rudimentary,     if real, knowledge of physics
 and physiology       — of the doctrines of the permanence of matter through
 transformation,        of conservation and dissipation        of energy, and of
 the functions of living organisms — will here            serve  for a commence
 ment.       Nor will more     be postulated    in the present work.
      The plan of the undertaking will now be readily understood;                it
  is, in short, once more to prepare for the construction of a           " system
                    "
 of economics — not, however, by means of new definitions                  and old
  dialectic, nor by the deductive application of a few principles taken at
  random from an early state of some single science            — but in harmony
  with the organic whole of the preliminary sciences ; using,             as far as
  may be, such materials          as after due refining      economic literature
  may afford ; thereafter proceeding           as far as possible    by investiga
  tion.     It is necessary   then, in the first place,    to collect and arrango
  the materials for such       a system by successively extricating      from the
  vast mass of too discordant           economic literature, and by observing
  as  far  as possible    in actual society — first, the most important facts
  and generalisations of physical and chemical nature ; next, those
  essentially biological      and psychological ; finally, those distinctively
  sociological   — uniting this task of constructive criticism           and new
  observation      with such application of those respective sciences as
  may be     possible.     Thus principles of economics serviceable for the

 948                  Proceedings     of ike Royal Society
 subsequent construction of systematic economics            can be obtained ari
 tested; and to point out the road which may lead to the elueidati                rti
 of such principles — without any        pretence at exhaustive       treatment   of
 detail — is the aim of this paper.         The existing economic literature,
 then,   will henceforth     be regarded     as  a storehouse      of ideas of   all
 kinds and ages, which, in so far as scientific, we have to disentangle
 and arrange     on the plan above outlined into bodies of principles,
 dealing with each successive aspect of the subject, physical, biolo
 gical,   psychological,    and social, these     forming     separate chapters,
 each accompanied by         a  summary, while       the appreciation        of the
 history   of economics      will   be postponed.       The inquiry       as to the
 logical method or grammar of economics,                 and the mathematical
 principles involved in its treatment, instead of forming              the subject
 of an initial dissertation,     will  be relegated     to a final  appendix also
 of partially historical character.
    § 10.  But the economist,        even   if not refusing the systematic
 application    of science    above   proposed,    will   urge   that    economies
 must not only be pure but applied, not only scientific but practical.
 Assuredly so    ; for while eliminating      as irrelevant any admixture        of
 practical   considerations with the purely scientific portion of the
 subject, it will yet be attempted, in an appendix to each chapter,
though of course only in the most brief and general way, to indicate
the possible lines of modification of each set of factors, whether such
modification has been effected or attempted in past or present time,
proposed    by any of the various schools of practical economists, or
suggested    by scientific knowledge.
    §11. The plan      proposed   is thus easily applicable to the wants of
either specialist or generalises whether of scientific               or practical
bias  ; for the chapters may thus be successively read for the doc
trine, and     their   respective appendices thereafter for the derived
practice.    And when the work is completed, while               those especially
familiar    with the preliminary        sciences   will doubtless prefer the
ascending    ordor from physics onwards, the student whose interests
lie rather in the supreme       social and practical aspects of the subject,
will without much inconvenience take the chapters and appendices
in  the reverse or descending order.
   § 12.   But   even   then we have no system of economics.                 True,
nor has any system        yet existed, the innumerable so-called systems

being, as we have seen, complex mixtures of ideas of every possible
order, which, from the present point of view, are to be regarded as
material to be disentangled and rearranged                  on the plan above           out
lined into     bodies    of principles      dealing with     each successive         aspect
of the subject.           Those      principles   once     extricated,      however, we
obtain    a   key to the mode        of construction of these          systems,      and an
explanation      of their incompleteness          — each    school,    as    was    already
pointed out, having grasped             principles chiefly referable to one order
only, and having used these to the practical exclusion of principles
belonging      to other orders.          Hence such efforts       as     to restrict    the
domain of economics           to questions of statistics, value,            or exchange       ;
and the attempt thus to solve all problems is obviously incomplete.
Similarly, the restriction of           the subject to material wealth, without
consideration of the organisms of which the occupations, rate of repro
duction, mode of competition, &c, furnish biologico-economic prin
ciples.   So with the investigation of biological principles without heed
of the next order of factors — the psychological principles — or the very
frequent attempts at completing             a system,     by the aid indeed of biolo
gical and psychological considerations, but without passing from the
study of the individual to that of the higher unit— the society —
with which the sociological principles                 are alone concerned.           These
are    all examples       of an attempt on the part of each                  preliminary
science   to annex the province of the succeeding               one, an error which
of necessity vitiates the system thus obtained.                 To this intrusion of
each preliminary        s3ienco upon the domain of its ascending successor,
the term "materialism," though generally restricted to the attempt
to reduce all sociology and morals to biology and physics, has with
great advantage         been sometimes      extended.
   § 13. The existing systems of economics are not only vitiated by
this error of some form of             " materialism," but      also     largely by the
converse and       if possible       more   serious    error, that of attempting to
make any one science          do duty for those          which underlie       it,  — which
may conveniently bo termed
                                        " transcendentalism."
                                                     The attempts at
                                     "
system vitiated through the error of   materialism," which we have
just   been criticising,    have largely indeed been due to an even earlier
prevalence of "transcendentalism."                    The man of moral bias, in at
tempting to construct        a   perfectly moral theory of economics                without
full and constant        reference    to the facts of exchange,          of production,

 furnish the principles underlying any moral theory, — has long since
 Drought the     whole subject of morals into disgrace among                econo
mists, with the lamentable       yet not unnatural        result that any      one
attempting     to introduce ethical considerations, even in their           proper
 place, is apt to be scouted as a
                                     " sentimentalist."      Again,    the econo
 mist    to whom    the society   is   of paramount       interest,    frequently
ignores its individual components, and so on.               So strong, indeed,
is this tendency to transcendentalism,         that the class of principle*
with which     we shall commence our ascending survey           — the     physical
— has     been the very last to secure a hearing.       In   short, each of the
succeeding chapters, physical, biological,       &c, looked at         alone, is a
systematised materialism to its successors,       and a transcendentalism
to those which precede it.      Hence the need for an ultimate synthesis,
which must aim at recouciling all these different points of view.
    § 14. The synthesis to be attempted, then, must aim not only at
balancing the claims of all these principles without that excessive
or defective insistance     upon one order of them which constitutes
materialism or transcendentalism,        but at interweaving        them into       a
lasting whole.      The postponement of the construction of a system
 (imperfectly foreshadowed, however, in the Classification of Statistics)
 to the present task — the discussion of principle — is thus necessitated ;
 hence the plan of the present work.

    § 15.   General Enunciation    of the Problem. — Passing over the            dis
 cussion of the mathematical      aspects   of economic phenomena to              th*
 consideration   of their concrete physical      aspect,   we are not simply
 concerned with the abstract theory of statistics or of exchange, bet
have to investigate the concrete economic facts         ;  and these      not   only
 in their quantitative, but also in their qualitative          relations.       Tbe
 apparatus and the processes of social activity have to be observed              rai
 classified with an equal   eye towards minuteness of detail and extent
 of generalisation;    they must, moreover, be expressed in terms of
physical science.       For as the physical     physiologist    has long       ac«
definitely undertaken     the task of explaining the mechanism              of tix
individual organism in terms of chemistry and physics                ;  or as tht

physical geologist Hot only observes the form and changes of the
earth's crust, but explains them by the aid of the same sciences             ; so
precisely must the physical economist deal with those phenomena of
the visible universe which are specially allotted          to him.     From the
present point of view we must constantly               bear in mind that all
these phenomena are alike material — that all the changes which we
observe, whether     in the earth's crust, in organisms, or in the inter
action    of organisms with their         environment     (an inquiry within
which indeed       the economic operations of mankind are not only
recent but comparatively         small), are alike expressible      in terms of
chemistry    and    mechanics.       Social  phenomena      are  to   be viewed
simply with regard to the matter and energy consumed or liberated,
and physical economics is thus the study of certain forms of matter
in motion.
    § 16.  Particular Enunciation of         the  Problem — Leaving      to later
chapters those considerations of biological, psychological, sociological,
and ethical scope, which are present or latent in almost every extant
discussion of "material wealth," and endeavouring             to dispense alto
gether with metaphysical thought and metaphorical               expression, and
postulating    simply the elementary facts of physical science, and
more especially those of the doctrine of energy, we may enter upon
our inquiry.      What is this "wealth," what is meant by its "pro
 duction," its "distribution," its "consumption?"             "What are "land,
labour,    and capital    ?
                            "
                               What is this    process   of " exchange," and
 what is the meaning of        "value?"      What    are "producers and con
 sumers," and so on     ?
    § 17.   Qualitative     Analysis. — It is convenient to begin with the
                                 "
 "producers and consumers.          These indeed as organisms might at first
 sight seem only admissible when biological aspects of the subject are
 being discussed, but it has just been pointed out that the physiolo
 gist has already in great part interpreted their functions in terms of
 pure physics, and we are thus not merely entitled,               but bound to
 include them in our present survey.             They come before us, how
 ever, not in all their complex relations, afterwards to be discussed
 in the biological chapter, but simply      as so many forms of mechanisms
 constructed from the matter of the earth's crust and worked by the
 energy of the sun — as so many species            of automata called Homo,
 Formica, &c.       Every such automaton is of         course constantly    wear

952                  Proceedings      of  the  Royal Society
ing out, and its energy running down — and               this waste which in
functions involve must be repaired by obtaining from the environ
ment periodic      supplies    of new matter and energy.                 From      the
destructive    forces  of the environment          it must similarly be           pro
tected ; and so on.       From the present standpoint            then     it is    not
merely analogous to, but identical with           a mechanism     ;
                                                                      " producers     "
are those automata      devoted to the acquisition of matter and energy
from the environment;           while     all are "consumers,"         and   in this
aspect in wonderfully      similar degree.
   Without ignoring the historic          services of the physiocratic        school,
the application of the conceptions of modern physics to economics
may be fairly said to date from Professor Tait's discussion                   of the
Sources of Energy in Nature, published about twenty years ago                    (see
North British Revictc,      vol. xl., also Balfour     Stewart on Heat, &c).
The subject has been developed to some extent by other physicists,
as  Siemens, Thomson,       &c, but      seldom   by economists,     with the dis
tinguished    exception of Professor Stanley Jevons,             whose investi
gations on the coal supply, and whose hypothesis of the correlation
of sun spots and commercial crises, are both essentially from the
present point of view.
    Starting then from    a  given territory at given time, and enumerat
ing the utilisable sources of matter and energy in the form given by
Tait, and adopted in the Classification of Statistics (p. 13, table B).
we may proceed to systematise the phenomena of production and
consumption, and this is most conveniently done in diagrammatic
form.     Let  us arrange    these facts    — which should of        course aim at
 statistical precision — in  a  first column.      (Op. at. and fig. 3.)
   After these we may further enumerate the sources of matter not
used for the sake of its potential energy, but on account               of its other
properties (physical, chemical, &c).            This matter and energy         are as
yet mere raw material or potential products, and require develop
ment into ultimate products         ;  the requisite processes of production
having generally three stages — exploitation, manufacture, and move
ment,    the last   including     transport and exchange      ;     for exchange
from our present       point of view is simply part of the process of
movement of the product from the place of production to that of
consumption.       That proportion of potential products (large in com
plex societies)   which has to be converted into apparatus                  need in

the stages of development is conveniently termed mediate products ;
and thus we have an exhaustive classification of all products what

    As has been already shown, such                  a   table includes not only an
account of the processes             of transport and exchange,                but of the
facts of the equally relevant though less investigated subjects of
exploitation    and manufacture, commonly grouped                     under technology.
   The standpoint        being thus sufficiently explained, and the stages
of production       defined,    it   is obvious that our            physical standpoint
enables and compels us to inquire into their details.                      Were this an
exhaustive treatise on physical economics,                  it should commence with
a minute statistical survey of the             sources of energy and of the pro
cesses of exploitation     — agriculture,         fisheries,   mines,    &c.     It  should
include not only the classical quotations from Smith on pin-making
and Babbage on the economy                   of manufactures, but             a   thorough
survey of manufactures and of the vast ap

Such a curve could, of course,         be precisely ascertained      for  some
elements    of recent   production;    and  valuable    conceptions, as, for
instance, the  "law of diminishing return,"       derived from it by mere
inspection.
    Similarly the specialisation   of processes known        as  " division of
labour," and the converse process of generalisation, or       " concentration
of labour," are more clearly intelligible.       "Capital" is     decomposed
into the apparatus    (mediate  products), and energy employed in pro

the economist   may by this time naturally ask.

      Such     detailed     studies are, of           course,         largely scattered .through
 economic literature, nor does any one dispute their relevance.                                                  Such
 abundant        extant investigations              as those upon                   the phenomena of
 trade and money, or the vast historical                         labours which are specially
 due to the German                 school, furnish abundant                        partly co-ordinated
 material.        The present aim           is,   however, to suggest how such positive
results must be systematised and interpreted                                   in terms of physics.
 And    it    must now be further shown that not only are our studies of
economic processes, so far as consistent with fact, capable of physical
expression,  and (1) that this leads to greater systematisation — to
greater precision of treatment in detail but also (2) that this mode

of treatment involves                a considerable            change in the conventional
theoretic point of view; and (3) that                            it   furnishes              grounds            for   a
systematisation of practical action.
  §    18.    Quantitative Analysis.              — The    conception of the processes of
production          and consumption              as one vast mechanical                          process       ;    the
view of society as         a   machine, in which all phenomena are interpreted
as integration           or disintegration          of matter, with transformation                                    or
dissipation of energy, affords not only                    a   generalisation of the widest,
but   a   systematisation of the most thorough kind                            ;       nor   is      its applica
bility qualitative only.              It   is   legitimate, nay inevitable, to apply the
quantitative        conceptions of physics            — the modern measurements of
matter and energy.              Such and such quantity of matter                                 is   exploited,
say a   units       so much     is   lost in each process of production                               (b   +   c

so much remains             as ultimate           product        (a       (b   +   c   +   d))   ;    after con
sumption so much of this becomes available for new exploitation                                                      as
a wast# product.            Again,     so many units of energy a are exploited                                        ;
the processes of exploitation,                  transport,     &c, cost            so many units, say
6;    the remainder         (a-b)     is   the energy available.                        This idea              is   ex
pressed by the upper portion of the diagram, fig.                          3       (q-v.).        The amount
of energy and matter exploited during unit time                                    is      denoted by the
first rectangle, and the quantity disintegrated                            and dissipated                      in the
process by its upper dotted portion                    ;     the difference passes to the
manufacturer, whose waste and expenditure                                 of matter and energy
are   similarly denoted        ;   the remainder, after again suffering deduction
for the      processes    of movement, and the accompanying                                      losses, repre
sents the amount of ultimate                    product, of which the transitory and

 in short, of price, labour, capital, &c, and              so on, have        all   to be dis
 cussed.       Much of this is done in ordinary              treatises   — the primary
 and      essential physical           problem, however, remains (untouched by
 economists, save              Mr   Jevons almost alone) — that (1) of estimating
 the total quantity of energy stored at our disposal in this form per
 area of      territory; (2) the        gross   and net quantity utilise 1 per unit
 time   (3) the details of its utilisation and ultimate dissipation.
          ;
     Thus physical precision can be approximately reached : measure
 ment in terms of units of energy as well as of units                         of weight     is
-practicable     :    and, this physical conception once introduced, its cxten-
 son to all processes must be attempted.                 For the treatment of this
 only     one other consideration need be pointed out — the                   possibility of
 expressing the labour of the producer-automata, just as we do that
 of the ordinary               machines with which they are so largely inter
 changeable      :    the horse-power of an engine is easily translatable into
 man-power — might,               indeed, always    have been so expressed ; this
                                     (of course averaging the same
 i ranted, the conception of a man-day
 for labourers of a given community at given time, though vastly
 differing according to the            age of energy) and its multiples             (man-year
 —
   man-life) with the higher multiples of these can all be approxi
 mately stated.   Producers and machines are, in short, not only
 interchangeable but commensurable.
    Against the gross product of exploitation must be set the quantity
 of matter and energy expended in its production, together with the
 quantity wasted through the imperfection of our processes, plus all
 losses through other agencies. The gross product is expressed by the
                         in the upper table, the deduction for losses
 rectangle of exploitation
is indicated by the uppermost portion cut off from      that for cost   it,
of production by the lower dotted portion, the remainder the net                is
product Upon this the processes of manufacture and movement
have to operate               and their cost and loss being similarly deducted,
                       is ;
the remainder                 the net amount of ultimate product.
     In   the hypothetical          graphic statistic of the table, the net amount
 of ultimate         product may seem unwarrantably          small in proportion to
the gross amount of potential product              ;   this smallness    is   intended     to
suggest                  of energy and, matter, often many times
              the vast losses
exceeding the product, due to the imperfection of our proces es.

958                   Proceedings of the Royal Society
   This  element,    however, does not of course         enter      into   the cost   of
production,     which    involves merely the apparatus,         mediate products
and enetgy actually expended, plus those losses by fire,                 &c, already
mentioned.       And thus, though the net quantity of ultimate product
may be very small in relation to the gross              quantity exploited, the
process yields a profit      so long   as the sum of the rectangles              repre
senting the cost of production at each stage does not equal or exceed
that representing ultimate         products, and this surplus is in fact the
interest paid by Nature upon the matter and energy expended                       upon
her during the processes of production.          The rationale of the partition
of this   surplus, and of the ultimate products             generally, cannot         be
considered until after the psychological and social conditions,                  which
so largely determine them,         have been investigated         ;  the actual facts
of movement and position of ultimate products can                       of   course  be
observed,   and the physical economist then has means of measure
ment and       comparison other than          that   afforded by money, — his
units are really the metre and kilogram of the physicist,                 — and only
when some        quantitative    data   in  these,   terms are        approximately
reached    will   those expressed     in money      be  really capable of inter
pretation.    And if      space allowed,    the difficulty of such statistical
                                  measurement      of all the greater economic
                                  processes   might    be shown         to   be much
                                  more   apparent than         real.     Many     frag

   § 19.  Quantity of Ultimate Products per unit time. —The quantity
of ultimate products obtained per unit time being known, the average

termed riches and poverty.                    But, as was pointed           out in the pre
ceding paragraph, though                   these phenomena can he observed, their
explanation           does not come        within our present province.

—The         summation of the quantities of product                    in   successive     times,
though         seldom considered, must, notwithstanding,                      be    attempted.
Taking the year              as our      unit time, the quantity of production                   per
lustrum, decade, generation, century, even per economic age, must all
be inquired into, and the ultimate aspect, the highest generalisation
of production, is that of the collective production of mankind — of
the Synergy of the Race, with its material products, transitory and
permanent.
     § 21.     Quality of Ultimate Products. — The problem of classifying
the ultimate products now arises.    These are frequently arranged (1)
according to their sources, or (2) according to the processes by which
they are obtained, while (3) the only plan which really treats them
as ultimate products at all, arranges them according to their relation
to the consumers (these being, as already explained, from the present
point of view mere automata needing fuel, shelter, covering, &c).
Ultimate products             are thus commonly classified              by economists, yet
an important rectification is necessary.
   The number of consumer-automata being definite per unit time,
the quantity of ultimate products required per unit time (" necessaries
of life      "),   fuel, shelter,   &c, for their structural and functional main
tenance       is   also perfectly definite and ascertainable.                Without enter
ing upon an elaborate yet practicable investigation of the details of
this,   it   is    evident that     a   criterion   is   furnished    us by the durability
of the automata in question.                   For,   if   these last the normal         time,   it
is   evident that the necessaries             for normal maintenance cannot                to any
serious extent have been deficient.                      Thus   we should expect      d,   priori
considerable definiteness of quality and quantity of ultimate products
through        all variations       of    space     and time    ;   yet rather     the reverse
seems observable.            For    a   Kussian, Norseman, and Scot, living in much
the same geographical               conditions      and for much the same time, the
quantity of ultimate            products consumed per annum                   is   enormously

¦what   we may take         in round numbers            as  £7, £14, and £30            respec
tively.     How is this        to be accounted for?
    The ordinary method of meeting the difficulty is to distinguish
ultimate     products into necessaries,             comforts, and luxuries, and               to
account     for differences         in consumption,             by assuming         a greater
amount of the latter.            To give this scientific precision, we may first
distinguish       the     ultimate     products         into    a    definite     quantity of
necessaries,      plus    a  variable amount of super-necrstaries, and then
inquire what is the quantity and what the quality of the latter.
The     food consumed in these                two     places      cannot vary       much     in
quantity,     the necessary        fuel   (proteids, fats,          amyloids, water) must
like   be present       in each case      ;   how is the enormous difference in
quality    to     be explained?         If   one    represents          necessary alone, the
other represents           necessary + super-necessary             :    the former    replaces
structure and maintains the energies                  ;   but the latter is only          inel
 igible when we anticipate and borrow a conception                             from physical
physiology      :  it is  addressed     to the stimulation              of the sense organs,
gustatory, visual, aud tactile, of the consumer                       — represents   so  much
eesthesis.     The variable         super-necessary          must henceforth therefore
be termed       the aesthetic element, and ultimate products are accord
ingly analysed into their necessary and their aesthetic elements.
    From the preceding discussion it is obvious that                            if population
and duration        of life     be constant, all increase              in ultimate products
per unit time is        expressible in terms of aesthesis, and it remains to
investigate the relative amount of this.
    It is commonly assumed              by economists of all schools, that in pro
duction the necessary element enormously predominates — in any but
the very poorest communities, however, this conclusion has no justi
fication in observed fact.            In    the above case of Russian, Norseman,
and    Scot, even      if   we assume the consumption pf the first as purely
of necessaries, the element           of aesthesis in the consumption                   of the
last must      be approximately ^local differences                    in purchasing power
Vicing disregarded, especially as smallest for necessaries)                         measured
by the difference          in expenditure       above       mentioned, and must stand
to the necessary element             as   say 3 to 1.           So far, therefore, from
calmly ignoring a?sthetic considerations,                   a nearer       approximation     to

the facts of production        and consumption      might actually have been
reached by economic writers had they restricted themselves to these.
    Thus,    even  for  the physical  study of production while the import
ance of the necessary       element is fundamental,         that of the aesthetic
is superior.      In    any at all civilised    community,       in short, every
ultimate      product    has visibly   superadded      its (esthetic   subfunction
of visual stimulus, and (without trespassing in any way upon the
province of aesthetic criticism          by considering its quality) the
physical economist must estimate the details and cost of production
of   each of these    two elements respectively.          And when     we add up
                 subfunctions of all "
                                                     "
the aesthetic                            necessary       ultimate   products, and
add to this the vast quantity of purely aesthetic                products, we see
how small the fundamental           element of production         has become in
relation     to the superior, and reach       the paradoxical       generalisation
that production,       though  fundamentally     for maintenance, is mainly
for   art.
    § 22.   Consumption.    — Passing to    the  study      of the disintegration
and dissipation of energy which we term consumption, we find that
this takes place     at variable  rates.   What disappears per unit time
as food, clothing,     &c, is termed transitory, what remains is relatively
permanent.        As the unit time is extended from day to year, and
from year to generation and century, the transitory element of course
increases, at the expense of the permanent.              And since the ultimate
product     newly produced     + the store of permanent products consti
tute the quantity of wealth per given             time,      this is  seen  to be
equally modifiable by the two independent variables of production
and conservation.         The old conceptions of domestic economy find
here their place        and use,   and only require generalisation           to be
exhaustive.       The term consumption is only fairly applicable             to its
transitory element, and should be superseded in its generalised
sense by the homelier term        of we.

tion of    use by extending space and time       till  we reach the synergy      of
the race (§ 20), the importance of the element of conservation becomes
of ever-widening importance, for the accumulated wealth — and con
sequently the historic synergy — may be said to vary almost inversely
as the transitory,      and directly as the permanent elements of pro
duction.

   § 25.    Practical Physical Economics. — On the plan already outlined
of investigating the practical aspect of our subject, we should
inquire in what directions do all the various observed social changes
tend    ? what modifications of them are consistent with physical law                     1
and by the systematisation             of these obtain          our ideals or Utopias     :
but it    needs no detailed investigation             to see that all changes of pro
duction and consumption tend either towards increase or diminution
of their results        per unit     time        (even maintenance of production
tending      strictly to the former), every movement of man upon the
globe acting in one or other of these directions                    ; hence   ;
ideals of production        appear at once, and admit of simple            1

    § 26.  Ideal of Production. — We        are  called upon here to select
between two alternative ideals, and without entering into any dis
cussion    of optimism      or pessimism,    we are compelled as practical
economists     to ignore the second, which leads of course to the nega
tion of practical economics altogether.           We have simply then to
discuss the practical means of maximising          production     per unit time,
though noting that every action in the community               is ascertainably
of one or other tendency.
    § 27. Production.
                          — Starting from the estimate of the attainable
sources of energy in nature, and from the scrutiny of the processes
 of technology       and   movement already outlined,        our maxim leads
 directly to the organisation of production       so as to maximise ultimate
 products.     Improvements      in exploitation, increase in manufacturing
 power, diminution of friction in transport,          simplification     of trade,
 are the four great heads of this process of which the endless details
 need not be here developed, especially as on the theory of conserva
 tion of energy all      are reducible  to the same unit of measurement,
 With respect to organisms this involves (1)          a maximisation      of their
 usefulness for production        in every possible way besides the          corre
 8ponding increase in their numbers.
     § 28.  Consumption.    — Passing to the maximisation of consumption
 per unit time, we see at once that this involves              making      all pro
 ducts transitory; minimising similarly implies making all permanent.
 Hence maximisation           of  permanent     products   has a       reactionary
 diminutive     effect on the producing population,     just  as the opposite —
 maximisation       of transitory   products — involves   their indefinite       in
 crease.
     In other words, the physical economist, desiring to increase not the
 population,    but the wealth of nations, — instead of simply approving
 the continuous development of the existing industries, and attempt
 ing to increase      average  well-being by stimulating the exploitation,
 manufacture, or exchange, of the transitory products                 with which
 these    mainly deal, — must advocate the proportional          increase   of per
 manent ultimate products, and organise industrial processes towards
  that ideaL      We have thus reached the new paradox             (cf. § 21) that
  the sphere of practical physical economics is to discuss the ways and
  means of increasing not so much bread, as Art.

9G4                   Proceedings       of  the  Royal Society
                   Chapter      II.— Biological Principles.
    § 29.   Widely current in economic literature             are conceptions    which
seem to have more or less biological character — one hears               of " parasit
ism,"   of" competition," of " laws of population," of the "social organ
ism," and even of its " circulatory," and " nutritive organs," and so on,
besides many others which though not necessarily couched                    in current
biological language, yet readily bear translation.               It is here proposed
to criticise and, to some extent, systematise             this aspect of economics.
    At starting,    we meet the difficulty,       that past economic literature
necessarily shares       the  character      of  past  literature in general, aud
more or less completely ignores           physiological, zoological, and anthro
pological facts altogether.           It  is necessary     to postulate    the results
of all these      sub-sciences      most clearly, and the biologist, avoiding
 misleading "comparisons            between      man    and     nature," must work
 forward     from the     actual living "man and his place                in nature,"
 without     particular respect      to the    authority     of any time-honoured
 theories   of "human nature," or of the "economic man."
    In passing from     the physical to the biological aspects of economics,
 our producers and consumers             are no longer regarded         as automata,
 and generalised      along with machines          ;  but are looked on as speci
 mens of a     species of living organism, to be generalised with the rest
 of organic nature, terminating              the  greatest     line   of genealogical
 ascent, and     supremely successful in the struggle for existence and
 domination, in virtue of peculiarly             high evolution of the nervous
 system.
     Our biological studies then commence              with     a knowledge     of  the
 statical aspects of Homo         ; with an organised census,* in which             the
  quantity    aud quality of the population are carefully recorded                : the
    *
      The reader may at first suppose that it is here attempted to discuss ques
 tions essentially sociological under biology — but this "materialism" (c § 12)
 will be carefully guarded against All that concerns only the objective and
 bodily side of a man is purely biological ; and this may be summed up for a
 number of men, looked at simply as a herd or mass, without leaving the field
 of pure biology. Sociology, on the other hand, concerns itself with indivi
 dualities of a higher order: — with aggregates of men integrated into wholes
 for definite functions ; as firm, bank, company, regiment, post office, and only
 considers the individual components in their relations to these.          The census,
 then, is primarily biological, but also of course has sociological elements of
high importance ; — but these await separate and subsequent discussion.

 observations of the biologist, and the anthropologist, of the registrar,
 census-taker and actuary, the hygienist and the educationist, are all
 organised into a vast body of knowledge               — the statistics and      gene
 ralisations of the new sub-science of " demography." *
    But our survey must      be not only statical but dynamical,            not only
structural but functional     ; how are we to approach this          ?   Protoplasm
undergoes incessant waste, and demands incessant repair, and it is
 this fact which underlies economic activities.              However     different in
details, all the higher animals agree in obtaining               the food needful
for repairing the     waste  of their     tissues,   from their environment          by
the performance of muscular contractions                co-ordinated by the ner
vous system.       And this furnishes us with the widest definition of
productive     labour: — while the "sense of effort," the "pain," the
"curse of labour"      so much insisted on, is at most merely an accom
paniment,     incidental    either     to    excessive     exertion    or  defective
adaptation to the task
    § 30.  Evolution of Production. — From the simple conception of
animal production here laid down, we have to trace the evolution of
modern industry; nor are the main steps numerous or difficult.                     The
animal demands only ultimate            products, and at first only produces
food, accepting for shelter simply what the environment                   chances to
afford.    "With increasing intelligence, shelters are next constructed                 :
a bird's nest is as truly an ultimate economic product to its builders
as a house to man.        In the    case of some        the aesthetic   subfunction
begins to appear, and some animals, like the Australian                 bower-bird,
even spend no little labour on purely aesthetic               production.      Stages
of exploitation,     manufactures,      and movement are frequently              more
or    less distinguishable;     but     all products       as   yet  are   ultimate.
Mediate products, however, also tend             to   arise —-like the roads and
granaries of the ant, the engineering works                of the beaver,      or the
stick and stone of the higher apes — from which to the rough flint
implement      of the palaeolithic man the transition is easy.                 Given
this implement, however, man becomes                "  a tool-using animal," and
the evolution of ultimate products goes on apace.                 From this point
the history of productive processes is being admirably traced by tho
combined labours of archaeologists           and historical     economists.       It  is
sufficient here to recall the origin and aspects of the producers.

 entiation once set up,             it    continues       as   long as circumstances render
it   advantageous           or possible, and the complicated co-operation of the
 ant-hill or the city alike arises.                     These familiar considerations show
 that the     " specialisation of functions " in Formica and the " divi

     £   31. Rcitult       of    Specialisation         of   Function     upon Organism.          — The
 differentiation of production leads then to the development of occu
pations, which, especially when perpetuated by heredity, are again
seen to be of identical nature with those of the polymorphic                                      indivi
duals of the ant-hill.                    And all occupations                 are not     directly    con
cerned       with      production:              some     individuals          specialise      into      the
indirectly productive service of government; others leave productive
operations        on surrounding                nature for the bodily care and service
of their fellows        ;    others,      again,    become        unoccupied        ;    and thus the
throe great classes of occupations {Classification                            of   Statistics)   are not
simply analogous,             but identical among               bees, ants,        or men, and are
sometimes         more       differentiated         in the former,              sometimes        in   the
latter.      Just     as    the     operations of heredity upon man and other
organisms        are not merely analogous but identical, so also                             are those
of function.           Division of labour                has specialised the polymorphic
castes of the          ant-hill;       so the same specialisation                   of function       acts
towards developing similar polymorphic changes among men.
     Every    one   is     more or less conscious of this                 :   it   is   never difficult
to   distinguish        a    soldier from a joiner,                or     a    ploughman         from    a
weaver;       while        the    physician        reaches       almost incredible             skill in
ending the finer results of occupation                         on bodily structures, normal
and pathological alike.

   The biological reader may well wonder at the insistance upon
what is to him a commonplace ; but, like so many of the scientific
commonplaces enlarged upon in the present analysis, it has been
ignored    by the vast majority of economic writers.                     It  does    not
come   within the study of          processes    of production      on one hand, nor
within    that of social aggregates            on the other    ;  the occupations      of
ploughman and weaver or joiner are                alike productive — are all equal
in the   eye of the       politician and before the law.              To economists,
whose preparatory studies included no biology, any insistance upon
the wide     difference     of these       occupations     to  the men performing
them must needs 6eem mere nonsense, and the proposal to found
practical    action     upon      the    observed      results   pure   "sentiment."
But, without the slightest postulation                  of morals, it is  a biological
fact  that,    as   " function makes the organ," it also                  shapes     the
organism, and modifies it either for evolution                  or for degeneration      ;
moreover, other things equal, determines its quantity of health and
limits   its length      of   life.      Ploughmen        and weavers, joiners or
soldiers, then, are incipient castes, as surely as Brahmin and Pariah,
queen, worker, and drone, are formed ones                  ; and the disadvantages
of the division of labour,         so slowly forced into prominence (as,          little
to the credit of biologists, they have been) through the sufferings of
the many and the moral enthusiasm of an unscientific few, demand
study and classification           among the
                                                    " Variations of Animals and

   § 32.   Modification      by Environment,          — Even when we study the
ancestral   environment         separately as heredity,          and the functional
environment       or occupation separately         as function, besides leaving the
social environment         for    a subsequent        discussion,    there remains      a
series of influences,        those      of  the    ordinary     environment,    which
probably    exceed      any others in importance.                Food,   which alone
determines whether the young bee is to be worker or queen, has a
thoroughly      well-marked        influence    upon men.         The importance of
the quality of the atmosphere                 is becoming recognised.          So also
 with light  :  the gardener blanches his celery, the zoologist stops the
development        of -the tadpole       by withdrawing light, the sphygmo-
graph shows how the pulse bounds at every gleam of sunshine, and
the physiologist       and physician are not hesitating             to generalise and
apply   these results to the development              of human life in towns.

 908                   Proceedings     of the Royal    Society
     It  has been assumed       by most economists that the "        necessities of
       "
 life    were simply food, shelter,      &c, and that the subtler         factors oi
 the environment need not be included.               This pre-biological     concep
 tion need not be argued with, for the economic problem                      of  the
  maintenance of men is but one special case of the vast problem                   of
 the modification of      organism by environment, exactly as the descen;
 of man is     a special case of the origin of species.
             Mode                                            by Environment       —
     § 33.            of Modification of Organism
 Although time and         space    and knowledge     do not admit      of tracing:
 out these lines of modification in detail, some idea of the two main
 lines of evolution and degeneration respectively must be obtained.
 It  is convenient      to begin    with the latter, since the conditions of
 degeneration in the organic world are approximately known.                   These
 conditions of degeneration are of two very distinct              kinds —on      the
 one hand, deprivation         of food, light,   &c,   so leading    to imperfect
 nutrition and innervation          ; on the other, a life of       repose,    with
 abundant supply of food and decreased exposure to the dangers o:
 the environment.          It  is noteworthy     that while    the   former only
 depresses,     or at most extinguishes,        the specific type, the Utter,
through      that disuse of nervous and other structures,             &c, which
 such     simplification    of life involves, brings       about   that far more
 insidious     and thorough      degeneration seen in the life history of
 myriads of parasites.        It  is noteworthy    that both these sets of con
ditions     of organic change exist abundantly           in society, the former
                                                     "
 being known as poverty, the latter as                  complete material well-
being."       The influence of all this upon the degeneration of indivi
duals and upon the decline and fall of nations alike, need not be
 insisted upon.
    Passing      now   to the less known          conditions   of   evolution      as
opposed to degeneration, it is obvious that (1) adequate conditions
of food, light, atmosphere, are necessary ; (2) that the organise
and primarily the nervous system, must be adapted to mora and
 more complex conditions of the environment ; i.e., that the nerToci
system must become more and more highly evolved.
    Hence arises the physiological          explanation    of the   aesthetic   *cb-
function in production, of which            we were    compelled to notice tix
enormous importance even under the preceding analysis of phy>2»-
principles.      It is determined by the need        of the various    senses,  is

  the cry for so-called " utility
                                         "
                                             in ultimate products is frequently
   nothing more than          a  demand for the lower forms of sesthesis in
  preference to the higher.
      § 34.   Definition of Production. — No definition of production is
   possible from the physical point of view alone, since it involves a
   knowledge of the organism to which production                is adapted.      Now,
  however, production         is definable in general terms as the adaptation
  of   the environment      to human functions; and every productive action
  thus tends either towards maintenance and evolution or                  the reverse.
  This simple idea is not yet, however, sufficiently                   active in our
  industrial     age.     The functions        of production   are undertaken        by
  industrialists,     chiefs and proletaires alike,       mainly with the notion
 of obtaining       " wealth " in its very variable proportions of main
  tenance, power over others, personal immunity from function,                     <fcc,
 a conception of the nature and aim of production upon which our
 surviving industrial anarchy mainly depends.               The adaptation of the
  ¦world   to the wants     of the  species,   which we   see to be the beginning
 and end of production,          is again definable in biological         language as
 the substitution       of human for natural selection.
     § 35.   Polymorphism       and Competition.    — We have already       seen how,
 in the evolution of production, specialisation of function in a com
 munity of organisms was attended by polymorphism — the resultant
 structural specialisation.         This polymorphism has         a most important
 bearing      on the economy of the community.               In   a  little differen
 tiated community, competition is at its highest pitch ; in a poly
 morphic one, it is reduced almost to zero.                  In a hydractinia or
 siphonophore       colony, in an ant-hill or bee-hive, competition is mini
 mised.       Struggle    for existence between the         members has ceased,
 the only struggle is with other communities.                So far, then, is com
petition from being the             sole  idea derivable     by economics        from
biology,      as is so commonly        supposed, that in fact competition             is
ever in inverse ratio to polymorphism               ; and in a given community
 polymorphism          puts an end to internal, though not necessarily of
course to intersocial,         struggle.     Internal competition      can only be
intense in large communities where there is but little polymorphism.

  §     37. Practical Biological Economics.                    — As in        the case    of physical
economics, so here we have two alternative practical ideals                                 :
         1.   To maximise the maintenance                      and evolution of the com
                 munity.
         2.   Or to minimise the            same.
All     action   is   referable to either of these categories,                      and tends neces
sarily in one of those directions.                     As practical economists,                  we are
shut up to the selection of the first, and we have only to consider
 how this ideal can best               be realised.           This involves           a   criticism of
 life from     a   biological     standpoint     ;   a      subject analysable into endless
 detail, e.g., the criticism          of production alone embracing processes                               so
 apparently          remote as food -analysis and art-criticism.                      The details of
 such    a    discussion cannot be given here, but the lines to be followed
 may be indicated.               The modifications                  of    the organism          must    be
 determined          and      analysed into their various factors, viz.,                         (1)   the
 effects of organism on organism                 in heredity (education and compe
 tition)   ;   (2)     the influence        of function on the organism toward*
 degeneration on the one hand, and towards evolution on the other                                             .
 (3) the modification of the organism by its material environment,
 such as food, dwelling, air, light, &c. Not only must these factaa

 in modification        be observed and appreciated, but their            modifiability
 must be discussed and acted upon.                   Thus, in the      case, when any
given environment             or function,   however apparently          " productive,"
 is really fraught with disastrous influence to the organism, its modi
 fication must be attempted, or, failing that, its abandonment faced.
     After     a thorough       analysis of this sort we can attempt the treat
 ment of such practical questions as the state                   of the poor, or the
 advancement of social progress in general — since practical action, at
 present dispersed into special efforts, each dealing with some aspect
 of organism, function,           or environment       alone (or of some mixture
 of these), must on pain of failure attempt the synthetic treatment
 of   all*
     It   only remains to       be pointed   out that the ideals of human selec
 tion which        are beginning     to be suggested on all hands, as biological
 conceptions penetrate modern thought, are to be worked out on one
 economic basis, that of adapting production                to organism.
                   Chapter      III. — Psychological        Principles.
      This department of the subject, unlike the two preceding, has an
 extensive literature, of which it is necessary to examine the main
 positions at the outset.
     § 38.    Pleasure and Pain.       —A psychological basis for economics has
often been sought in the theory of pleasure and pain — in the con
ception that we should             find at once a theory of observed actions
and a basis for expedient action in the pleasure or pain observed to
attend them.           Without disputing        the possible high importance of
this standpoint,          or insisting too much         upon the impossibility of
verifying the measurements of pleasure and pain which Mr Jevons
and Mr Edgeworth especially have used so freely, it must be
pointed        out that     it is far from furnishing an absolute criterion.
According to Spencer, " pain is correlative of actions injurious to
the organism, and pleasure of those which are advantageous."                      But  a
    *
       I.e., all  beneficent or benevolent agencies whatever thus fall into three
genera,     or rather brigades (e.g., ecclesiastical, charitable, educational, medical,
&c, into the first; trades-unions, &c, into the second; associations concerned
with hygiene, housing, art, &c, into thethird).           This classification, moreover,
corresponds to the developmental succession of such agencies ; and this is now
approaching an end, while the requisite co-ordination is becoming possible.

972                    Proceedings        of the lluyal       Society
 qualification is necessary        — since pain is correlative of new adaptations,
 pleasure of old and familiar ones, which lead through economy of
 material to degeneration — not improbably one of the most pleasurable
 of    organic processes.           This theory,        then, will need         considerable
 emendation before being serviceable as                  a  basis for economics.
    § 39.    Conception of Value. — One of the latest and most nearly

 " value   "
              is that of        Jevons,* who resolves it into three distinct
 factors : — " (1) Value in use, or total utility ; (2) esteem, or urgency
 of desire for more, or final degree of utility ; (3) purchasing power,

 " value    does    not reside in the commodities                 themselves, and is no
more to be found in           a   loaf of breid than in          a   diamond, the water,
or the air."        And such definitions              and e::; lunations       axe   repeat<xi
indefinitely in other works.
    But in terms of the present analysis it is evident that the " value"
of anything has a significance varying with the standpoint of each
successive science, — that
                                      " ratio of exchange " expresses an essen
                                       " utility or intrinsic value " its physical or

respecting     the nature of value are                thus clearly analogous           to the
famous case of the gold and silver shield.                      From the psychological
standpoint,      for instance, the conception of intrinsic value is clearly
irrelevant ;    and to economists of conventional academic training,
acquainted with the current logic and metaphysics, but without                               a
suspicion     of physical        and biological        facts,   the exclusion       of every
other point of view necessarily followed.                     From this point of view,
especially     when we bear iu mind                 the idealistic       philosophy     of th*
 schools, the dogma of Bastiat is a commonplace, and the thoughtless-
copying of it by equally               pre-scientific      writers    is   natural  :  it has,
however, no more interest to the economist than any other platitude
of idealism     :  the facts for him being, as was above pointed                    out—(1)

the former is capable of maintaining              an average adult for     a  definite

physiological     functions are their subjective aspect, known as wants
or   desires (psychological       value) ; (5) that, as property, they acquire
a sociological "value," which cannot as yet be entered upon.
    The idealistic position, though extremely popular, has never been
consistently maintained        ;  the reverse position is often tacitly taken,
as apparently     in the dogma that " labour is           a  commodity," and the
like.
    The attempt then to base the psychology of economics upon the-
aspects of value, and much more to make it the centre of the
whole science, turns out futile         ;   so far from being fundamental,        it is
in fact almost superfluous, since it is either the subjective expression
of an actual objective value (physical, biological, or sociological), or
an erroneous hypothetical          estimate of one or more of these.
   §40.    Wants      and   Desires.  — Can "wants and desires," however,
be taken    as completely expressing the psychology              of action    ?   Pro
bably not completely,         since there is much           ground   for suspecting
that complex associations never formulated in consciousness play an
important     part  ;  perhaps, too,       that   even lower states of cerebral!
activity have their share in determining action.
    Let us   see, however, how the conception              is developed by econo
mists.     Their current positions may most fairly be stated by quota
tions from well-known authors.                 "Political economy teaches the
relation of man to those objects of his desire which he can obtain
only by his efforts"        (Walker, Science of Wealth,             p.  2).     "The
objects or satisfactions         obtained     by these    efforts are collectively
called wealth."                   " wealth is whatever satisfies        a desire or
                       Again,
serves a purpose."        Again, according        to  J. B. Say, " that society is
                                                                            "
most civilised     which produces most and consumes most ; or, in
other words, which has the greatest quantity of artificial wants.
From the preceding it follows— (1) that all wants and desires are
equally valid in the eyes of the economist, who can make no other
criticism   of wealth     ; (2) that      the only recognisable progress lies in
differentiation,   and in this most economists fully concur.
   Despite    the importance attached to wants and desires, they l ave

974                            Proceedings            of the Boyal         Society
rarely       obtained          any detailed           analysis     or classification              -whatever.
The most recent and elaborate attempt is probably that of Syae
          Science, p. 106).

as     affection, esteem, love, hate, &c. ;                    (III.)     AUoetic, having reference
to actions, and having for their object justice.
       In    the vast majority of works,                       however,             no such     analysis      is
attempted          ;    some    generalisation          of these         varied wants and desires
 is,   however, needed           ;    this     is   obtained by boldly uniting them under
the term self-interest                or egoism — this done,                  it    is    evident that self-
interest      is       the mainspring           of all economic action, and the basis of
orthodox           economics         is   complete.            A principle           capable of endless
deductive              applications       is   obtained, and        if     any unbelief           as to the
exhaustiveness of the generalisation                            arises,    the wide prevalence of
egoism        in the individual and in the community                                 is   readily appealed
to, and the sceptic held                   up to derision           as    a     sentimentalist          With
all     respect,        however, to these             systems,     a      new analysis          leading      to
somewhat different conclusions must now be briefly attempted.
  §     41. Statement            of Psychological              Principles. — In discussing the
biological         principles        of economics, we considered men                          as organisms
(a) having certain functions applicable to the maintenance inJ
evolution of self and others, or to the contrary and (b) with certain           ;
wants, i.e., requiring               certain adaptations                to the environment,              again
either in the direction                   of evolution          or of degeneration.                Wr     find
psychological principles                  parallel      to these.         Man        is   characterised by
the enormous specialisation of his nervous system, and psychology
though in the past mainly restricted to an imaginary account <A an
independent              entity, of mind             "as   a   thinking being in              pocho,"    really
deals with              the    subjective           side of the functional aspects                      of the
nervous system.                 Behind the muscular contractions                             by which all
economic action productive or consumptive alike are performed, are
cerebral stimuli inspiring these,                          and these       subjectively          considered
are wants and desires.                    The fundamental                 nature of the subject              is
therefore obvious.                As Walker             expresses         it,    ''the central force         is
the wants of man."                   That however the wants determining              produc
tion,       &c,   are not simple appetites                 for food, shelter, and the like,                  is
evident       when we remember how in the majority of products the

                         of Edinburgh,        Session 1883-84.                       975
aesthetic   sub-function       preponderates over that which would merely
satisfy the nutritive appetite.
    That desires realise themselves in efforts, and that efforts attain
satisfaction, is the psychological             or subjective side of the objective
fact that wants necessitate labour, and that labour results in wealth.
A    simple economic action — say an amoeba                    devouring    a grain    of
starch,    or    a  labourer     consuming      food, may be expressed in three
ways — (1) physical, the potential              energy of the body is increased          ;
(2) biological, the organism is nourished               ;  (3) psychological,   a desire
is satisfied.
    In the very simplest forms of life we find two essential forms of
vital action — the nutritive and the reproductive.                    But Leconte has
pointed out that, while the satisfaction of nutritive wants is funda
mentally      egoistic, the reproductive desire contains             the earliest germ
of altruism.         If this be   admitted, as it must be, the exclusion of the
altruistic element       as a determinant of economic action is at once seen
 to be a mere artifice, alike impossible and absurd,                if our psychology
 is to have any relation to living beings             ;   while the deductively con
 structed fabric       of orthodox economics collapses without criticism,
since one half of its foundation (" self-interest ") alone was laid.
Starting, then, from this primal manifestation of egoistic and altru
 istic desires,     we may briefly       follow the development of          these   with
 the ever-increasing structural and social complexity of the organisms.
 With limited supply and space, these nutritive wants and desires must
 result in competition between the individuals.                   Competition has, of
course,   its objective and subjective          aspects ; the objective antagonism
 must be represented by a subjective                egoism and mutual antipathy.
 But every       aggregate    which can at all       be termed a society has risen
to    some   measure       of   complexity     — of division of labour or poly
 morphism      ;   and even these       economists who insist most upon " self-
           "
 interest     are not wanting        in clear explanation of the economic advan
 tage of the process.            The subjective      aspect    of the   process   is not,
 however,      personal egoism and mutual                 antipathy  ;  since, for the
 co-ordinated muscular actions which any increase of polymorphism
 and synergy         imply,    a   corresponding     measure      of co-ordination     of
 nervous action is indispensable ; and thus, as competition involved
 antipathy,       so objective      co-operation involves       subjective   sympathy.
 As mutual antipathy implies individual               egoism,    so sympathy     implies

976                 Proceedings       of the Royal Socuty
a measure   of altruism.       Higher and higher differentiation            of social
structure and function involves corresponding subjective adaptation                   ;
as the economic duties of an        individual develop in complexity and
remoteness   to the immediate result, so must their subjective aspect
on pain of failure deepen and widen            ;  and thus the material evolu
tion demands     a moral evolution          running parallel to      it    That the
material evolution has for the time outrun the moral adaptation                    is.
in fact, from the present point of view, the essential explanation                 A
much existing economic anarchy.
    As the society      reaches     completer       polymorphism,      altruism in
creases ; progress    towards the physical and biological ideal of pro
ductive synergy involves        parallel progress to an ideal of sympathy
or maximum altruism.          This    does    not, however, at once extend to
different societies  ;  between      these    competition      and antipathy may
exist to any extent      ;  but   as antagonism        becomes    subordinate!     to
community     of interests,    here    also   antipathy     becomes    replaced   >>y
sympathy.
    The concomitant parallel      progress of reproductive action:
                                                                         — incident
upon the origin of        the  family and the progressive integration of
families into higher and higher aggregates — is too familiar to need
recapitulation here.       It is evident that even on the most sternly
biological grounds, so far from         a scientific basis for economic deduc
tion being furnished by
                               " the iron law of competition," the highest
 generalisation of the phenomena (from which deduction, if anywhrre-
 is alone permissible) is the accurate converse of this — the golden
 rule of sympathy and synergy.            And it is     a  remarkable result that,
 without introducing into the argument any so-called moral or senti
 mental considerations, but arguing soberly from the two fundamental
 functions and wants of living beings — from nutrition and reproduc
 tion alone — the noblest ideals of politics and morals arise before u*.

    § 42. Can our psychological conceptions of              (I) pleasure and pain.
(2) value, (3) of wants and desires, furnish a basis of economic
action?     Actions may be classified as they produce pleasure >r

has never been            successfully      applied      to social action-.          Not is it
adequate       even      in    the   simplest      case.       Taking       the amoeba      and
labourer of the preceding illustration, both frequently satisfy desire
by the consumption of that which is not food in the biological
sense, and of what supplies no energy from the physical.                                   Here
then a dilemma arises : if with the majority of economists we
recognise no physical               or biological       aspects     in the phenomena of
economics,         all wants and desires             are    alike     expedient,     since    no-
criterion of action exists, and               laisxez   /aire     becomes      the only prac
tical maxim.            If, however, wc recognise physical and biological
 facts, and the psychological              as the subjective          aspect    of the latter,
 then    the psychological            economist        must      simply commend           those
 wants and desires which              are conducive          to maintenance and          evolu
 tion, and these only.
     " It is not
                     enough to transfer the point of view from the indivi
 dual to the        race,     and to take the social factor into account                   ; we
 must also       frankly accept           the    biological       point     of view,    which,
 regarding     mental functions            as vital      functions,      and states of con
 sciousness as separable from                 states    of the organism           only  in our
 mode of apprehending them, sets aside the traditional conception of
 mind as an agent apart from the organism."                       *
     From this sharply defined statement of the position of the present
 chapter     (<•/.  Introduction,        § 13), we        are   thus    forced to draw the
 following economic corollaries: — (1) Since, from the physiological
 side, the nature, amount, and direction of muscular activities are
 dominated        by cerebral action, the cerebral functions are supreme ;
  (2) as similarly,          from    the    psychological         side,    all  functions    an*
 equally — nay,         are     solely — expressible         as    cerebral, the function*
  of creative and directive thought,                  the activities of education, &<:,
  are as   really      "productive"         as    any.      Thus our economic utilita
  rianism passes from the crudely practical state to that into whirh
  it has    been      recast by its more            philosophical         exponents; and       if
  psychology,       leaving       its academic       isolation,      assumes      its modern
  position,    schoolmaster, hodman, and artist,                     are    alike productive.
  The problem          of practical       economics now demands that we pro
  duce   not    that mere maximum                 of food and         eaters, which      is the
  first  aspect      of   the physical         ideal  ;   not    even     that perfection     of

 nature    which    underlies     the two former.           The problem,        in   £•£•-,
 inverts itself, becoming not merely how to fill bellies, but                   hew     to
 place brains in the conditions most favourable to their                 development
 aud activity, and so      the problem of practical psychological economics
 passes   into   that of education.           The    supremacy of        the aesthetic
 factor in production, demonstrated under " Physical Principles," is
 thus explained : — The modification of the environment which is the
object of production, while primarily addressing the nutritive
 system    and attending to protective needs, must culminate                   in  that
complex       organisation      of the      environment        which,     deliberate]*"
addressing itself to         the   stimulus     and    evolution     of the sensory-
 activities, is of such importance for the process                of cerebral evolu
 tion (a wealth of impressions being the indispensable raw material
 of the most complex or highly generalised intellectual conceptions),
 and which we therefore term fine art.

literature, (1) the physical analysis led to the exposition of the
mechanical aspect of society ; to the reorganisation of the theory
of    production      and    consumption,        culminating     in the generalisa
tion    of   the    synergy     of the race.         (2) The biological        chapter
outlined     the higher      aspect of the      same phenomena, defined            pro
duction,     &c, and        discussed     the    relation   of    organism     to   the
environment        aud      function — a definition         of    production      being
obtained in terms of maintenance and                   evolution.     (3) A psycho
logical outline in harmony with the present                   state of science was
attempted     ;  and     many subjects not usually treated under econo
mics were seen to form an integral part of the subject.                     Yet this
is by no means       sufficient  ; a   sociological analysis is wanting ; and
the whole series         of analyses     are   but materials       for a subsequent
synthesis.      But   a pause   may reasonably be made before entering on
this, and    a  clear gain has      been    made    if  these results are plain (a)
that the analysis of so-called systems            of political economy is neces-

sary   and     possible,     and     that    on the present lines;          (b) that   the
analysis     does   yield many results of clear principle and practical
application    ;  and (c ) most important of all, that many of the most
burning questions           between producer            and    consumer,    worker    and
capitalist,   individualist and socialist, utilitarian and sentimentalist,
are soluble on the field of pure science without appeal to sociological
or political methods at alL*
    To  the    present scheme          numerous objections           are constantly   pro
posed,   and    these,   so  far as    the   writer   is aware,   may bo analysed and
grouped     as  follows:   —  It   is   said   (1)   that   the  present survey is too
wide, that it discusses principles which are not relevant within the
proper sphere of economics               ;  (2) it seems difficult to make sure of
the actual       logical                   of the argument, and
                           sequence                                       (3) to see its
applicability to details         ;    or (4) there         arises a    suspicion  of the
insidious postulation          at some       early stage      of the argument of the
ethical    considerations which appear as results                  ;   or (5), and most
commonly, the results seem too good to be true.
    To which it may         be replied, that (1) hardly any matters are             intro
duced    which      will not     be     found,     in chaotic form indeed, in the
standard works on economics, and that the usual restrictions                       of the
subject to one particular division of the subject (e.g., to the theory
of production and consumption apart from the relation of these to
the organisms), are arbitrary, and proceed usually from ignorance or
misconception of the subjects excluded                   ;  and moreover that, even      if
it  may still be thought by some to be too wide in its scope, it is yet
a continuous train of reasoning connecting the widest generalisation
 of knowledge        (the classified sciences) on the one hand, with the
minutest       details of technology or consumption on the other;
while most so-called systems have been set afloat either without
cargo of fact or compass of science ; (2) that the present channel
of publication is the most direct method known to the writer
of challenging        and obtaining          a keen scientific        scrutiny; (3) that
 the indispensable          and    yet less pressing question             of its applica
tion to detail, although excluded because of limits of space, &c, can
not only be tested by any one who cares fairly to master the general
   *
     Thus the dispute preceding the passing of the Factory Acts did not lie
between   "economic science" and "sentiment," but between the ideals of
physical and biological economics (q.v. ).

 principles, but is at least to       a   very great extent vouched          lor  by  tk
 mode of construction (not only synthetic and                 deductive, but anaki
 and   inductive      throughout,       and embodying           the generalisation      of
long    preliminary      studies of economic detail) (see Ctassifiention                 /
 Statistics, p. 19).      This difficulty can be best got over by readit?
these essays side by side with such a vast storehouse                   of facts as    the
well-known       manual of Roscher           ;  though     the   reader  may be once
more and finally reminded that he must not expect to find                      in  these
rough draughts for the ground plans of successive                       stories  of   the
economic      edifice,  the    completeness       and detail, the colour and         per
spective of the projected whole.                (4) The suspicion of the prema
ture postulation of ethical considerations, if present, is due to the
reader's    discovering      more    or loss     clearly for     himself that ethiis
is not     an isolated       science,   but a generalisation          of  the acts      or
practice corresponding to each of the orders of scientific considera
tions, physical and biological,            <Src.,  and that the ideals of maxi
mum      production        and    maximum evolution             respectively were       as
much     the ethic of physical and biological                 considerations as that
of sympathy        is that     of psychological        ones.     The fifth objection,
due   to   discouragement from previous failures                  to find a synthesis,
need not of course be argued with.
    But   the   real   difficulty of the paper          lies   in its inevitable     aul
extreme compression, and its consequently generalised form                        —  the
requisite application         of  the principles to the familiar details of
economics,     and    their   exposition in more literary form, being alike
only suggested in an occasional sentence.                    The essential aim will,
however, have been attained            if it   has been adequately demonstrated
                                    —
(1) to scientific specialists physicists, biologists, or psychologists
alike — that each respective aspect of economics lies fairly within
their range, and (2) to professed economists, that such a mode of
reinvestigation is not only practicable, but expedient.
