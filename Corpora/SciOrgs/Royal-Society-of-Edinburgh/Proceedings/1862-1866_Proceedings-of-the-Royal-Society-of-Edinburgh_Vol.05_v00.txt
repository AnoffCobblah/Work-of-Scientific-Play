                      Monday, 1st December 1862.
Principal Forbes,        one-   of the Vice-Presidents, delivered the
                     following Opening Address : —
    Gentlemen,    — I propose     to address you on   this occasion with re
ference to the following points        : —
    First, to recapitulate    briefly the origin, the objects, and the Con
stitution of Societies similar to our own.
    Secondly, to trace the rise and general        history of the Royal So
ciety of Edinburgh.
    Thirdly, to consider what changes the progress of science and of
society render necessary or desirable in the working of associations
like ours, and how far such changes are safe and prudent.
     Lastly, to recall the history of this Society during the past
twelve months, especially with reference to the Fellows whom it has
lost.
    I. To   recapitulate briefly the Origin, Objects, and Constitution of
                          Societies similar to our own.
    Societies   having any true analogy to the academies of modern
 Europe, or to the Royal Societies of London and Edinburgh, or the
 Royal Irish Academy, have arisen within about 300 years. Italy
 was   their birth-place,   and perhaps, on the whole, in no country have
 they flourished     more.     They appear to have been the direct off
 spring of the spirit of inquiry so active in that country throughout
 the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.          According to the literary
 historians    of Italy, the cultivation of literature by academicians,
 salaried by the Government,          commenced at Rome in 1514, under
 the Pontificate of Leo      X.    It is well known, that the cultivation of
 literature and the fine arts continued         to be fostered   in Italy by
 similar institutions      during many generations.          The Accademia
 delta Crusca (named after the Italian word for bran or chaff, from
 the fanciful analogy of sifting the pure from the heterogeneous
 parts of the language),        and the Society of Arcadians,     which still

                      of Edinburgh,       Session 1862-63.                       3
exists or existed      lately, are familiar examples.        But the number of
kucIi associations       was vastly greater than we can find a parallel
ibr in other countries or in more recent times.
     After all, the typical form of the modern Royal Society or Aca
 demy is traceable       to the astonishing impulse given to the experi
 mental physical sciences in       Italy in the sixteenth century. The first
 such society recorded by Tiraboschi and Libri, the chief annalists
 of the revival of letters in Italy, was called " Accademia Secreto-
 rum Naturae," founded at Naples in 1560, of which the celebrated
 Baptista Porta was president.           It was suppressed, however, by the
 influence of the priests.          The Society of Lincei, or Lynx-eyed
 scrutators into natural phenomena, of which Galileo was a member,
 held its sittings at Rome.           It  was founded in 1604 by Cesi,           a
 noble Roman,        and  still survives, though after       a  long intervening
 period of inactivity.*
      It  is easy to see how the newly born interest of mankind in the
 investigation of nature by experiment, must, far more than mere
 literary discussion or dialectical argument, have fostered such asso
 ciations.      In  those glorious     days when a virgin mine of natural
  phenomena was first opened to the intelligent exploration                of man
 kind, the succession of inventions,          discoveries, and capital theories
  in physical science,       kept every thoughtful mind           on the stretch.
  The comparatively        recent    art of printing     served    to disseminate
  rapidly both facts and doctrines; the promulgation of the true
  system of the world by Copernicus, the improved astronomical ob
  servations of Tycho, the mechanics of Da            Vinci and Stevinus, the
  telescope of Galileo, kept all Europe in a tremble of expectation for
  the discoveries     of each succeeding year.          What could men do in
  such circumstances       but assemble with others like-minded, and see
  with their own eyes the facts which seemed to contradict               the expe
   rience or prepossessions of ages, and either maintain or overthrow
   the new philosophy ?         It was   under   such circumstances       that the
   Florentine Academy, " del Cimento" was founded in 1657,f under
   the patronage     of the Grand Duke Ferdinand            II.  of Tuscany, and
   with the personal support of his brother Leopold. The withdrawal

   As its name imports it was an association tor making cxptrimmis.

 4                    Proceedings     of the Royal    Society
of the latter from Florence in 1667, on being made a Cardinal, was
 followed by the decline and virtual extinction of this remarkable
 Society.      This is considered by Mr Hallam        as a  proof of the incon
veniences attending          such exalted patronage       of literary societies ;
yet   it  does not seem     to afford a sufficient   reason for the cessation
of the labours of       a society   which gave such indisputable proofs of
vigour, whose Transactions         remain a book of reference to this day,
and whose members, including the best and ablest pupils of Gralileo,
were well able to sustain their position amongst the learned men of
Europe.
    The wide reputation         of the Florentine Essays contributed, no
doubt, to the establishment — also under Royal sanction — of the
 Royal     Society   of London.      This took place in November 1660,
immediately       after the Restoration, and from that time their pro
ceedings may bo traced with minute precision.               Founded originally
upon the basis of a private Society for the cultivation of Natural
and Experimental Science instituted in 1645,            it was incorporated by
charter in 1662, four years before the Academy of Sciences of Paris
was     instituted in 1666 under the auspices of Colbert.             This last
was    incorporated with the previously existing Academie Francaise
founded for the cultivation of the French Language and Literature,
 much after the manner of the Crusca Academy in Italy.
    The Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society of London sub
sist, it is needless to say, to this day ; and each in their own sphere,
 and in varying ways, according to the exigencies of the time, have
contributed     in the most important way to the improvement of the
 Physical and Mathematical Sciences.               The unbroken series of
 Transactions      of both   are without a parallel in the history of know
 ledge     for continuity      and  importance.     The publication of the
 " Philosophical Transactions"           commenced in monthly numbers
on the 1st       March     1665. Our own Society has very recently ac
quired      for the    first time a complete set of these publications
from the commencement,            — an acquisition    of some difficulty and
importance.
    An hundred and twenty years elapsed before the progress of
knowledge       and of organisation     in the sister kingdoms of Scotland
and Iroland sufficed for the formal institution of associations on
pimilar principles and with similar ends to the Royal Society. The

                      of Edinburgh,       Session 1862-63.                    5
 Royal Society of Edinburgh was formally constituted in 1783, and
 that of Dublin, or the Royal Irish Academy, in 1785.               Both arose
 out of societies previously          existing, though of a more private
 character,   and not     incorporated.        As most interesting to us,     I
 shall presently     proceed to trace the rise of the Royal Society of
 Edinburgh.
    But before giving an account of this, let me interpose a remark
 on the organisation of such societies generally.         Even in early times,
 they differed from one another in respect of being either under the
 direct influence of the State, or of being merely private associations.
 This distinction continues        to the present day.      The French Aca
 demies, for example,       are   national institutions, and the members
 receive salaries from public funds.             The Royal Societies of this
 country,   on the     other hand,      are   free from even the vestige of
 State control,     and pursue their aims without pecuniary            objects,
 and according      to their own regulations.         This is not tho place to
 discuss the advantage of the two systems, in favour of each of
 which something may be said.                The place of a salaried acade
mician    is often really desirable        for those whose fortunes     do not
enable them to pursue the unremunerative                paths of science and
literature.     On the other hand, the pecuniary gain is liable to give
rise to motives      less pure than mere honorary distinctions can do,
on the part both      of candidates for the post and of the academical
electors.    It   appears from tho history of the Academic Francaisc
in its origin, that the enlargement and incorporation of it under
the State influence of Cardinal Richelieu was much resented by its
original members.
    The two forms of constitutions — the one creating a power in the
State with corresponding advantages to its associates, the other
receiving    an   impulse   entirely from within — are really so distinct,
that it seems    almost invidious to compare them. The latter appears,
from the history of our country, to be most congenial              to English
habits   in such matters      ;   and perhaps we have no great reason
to regret the absence      of       " Institute " under
                                an                        Imperial or Royal
administration.
   But another question arises with reference to such Societies as
those of London, Edinburgh, and Dublin : Whether, in default of
substantial endowments in connection with membership, an arti

6                  Proceedings     of the lioyal Society
ficial standard of literary and scientific distinction is       to be held up
as  regulating the entrance or refusal of candidates ? — whether, in
short, the members of our Societies            are to be held as unsalaried
academicians, — men selected for intellectual attainment alone, and
forming therefore      a learned class ?
    On this point, which is one of considerable importance,          I confess
that   I entertain  little doubt.    Whatever disadvantages may attend
the admission to Societies like this of persons who have no preten
sions to what, for convenience, one may call a ,professional acquaint
ance    with science, art, or literature,    I  think that they ought to be
eligible. It is little likely that where no emoluments or distinc
tions    present themselves,     the  privilege of membership will be
sought except by those who feel some sympathy with pursuits for
which they have probably a secret leaning, but from which they
have been withheld by force of circumstances.               I  say, Let them
come, and freely, and let us regard their adhesion          to our ranks as
a compliment      on either side.
    In Britain, all   experience   points   to this resolution   of what may
be   in some respects regarded as a      difficulty. From the day of the
 foundation of the Royal Societies, both of London and Edinburgh,
 the rule of mixture of classes, and the absence of an academic
 standard of exclusion, has been all but universal.         The co-operation
 of men of all ranks, and of the most varied occupations and acquire
 ments, was the very corner-stone of these institutions. While they
 diffused   a taste  for science amongst the nobility, gentry, and pro
 fessional men, this very mixture enhanced, in no small degree, the
 interest of the proceedings of the Societies themselves, and con
 duced to the respect shown to literature and science.              It also in
 directly aided the progress of the latter, by raising a largo fund for
 the publication of Transactions and the conduct of experiments.
     To attempt to enforce a contrary principle, would be to reduce
 the members of our Societies to a select few, without the advan
 tages which academicians        properly enjoy,     and without the cordial
 sympathy     which    the lay-members     (as they may be termed) con
 tribute to diffuse amongst an intelligent public, whose sentiments
  in such matters is never to     be despised.

                      of Edinburgh,       Session 1862-63.                        7
        II. — Sise  and Progress of the Soyal Society of Edinburgh.
    Guided by an interesting passage in the "            Life of Lord Kames,"*
it would appear that the germ of our Society is to be found in the
Sankenian Club, instituted in Edinburgh in 1716, for literary social
meetings, and which had the unusual duration (for such associations)
of almost sixty years.         It expired in 1774. It included among its
original or early members, Principal Wishart, Bishop Horsley,
Colin Maclaurin, John Stevenson, Professor of Logic, Lord Auch-
inleck, several of the ministers of Edinburgh and neighbouring
gentry, and, finally, Sir John Pringle, afterwards President of the
Royal Society of London.              No publications    are  known to have pro
ceeded from this Club.t
    Contemporary,      in part, with the Rankenian Club was a Society
for the Improvement of Medical Knowledge, instituted in 1731.
This Society, of which little perhaps is now remembered save its
published      Transactions,     appears to have been conducted with an
enlightened      sense   of the dignity and importance of associations for
the promotion of science, which its founders justly considered to be
more advanced by         publishing able papers, than by making           a parade

   t Since the reading of this address I have been indebted to Professor
Fraser of the Edinburgh University for a referonce to an interesting allusion to
the " Rankenian Club," contained in Dugald Stewart's First Dissertation          on
the Progress of Metaphysical        and Ethical Philosophy, part ii. sect. 4, where
he speaks    of Berkeley's celebrated system of Idealism having " attracted very
powerfully the attention of a sot of young men who were then prosecuting
their studies at Edinburgh, and who formed themselves into a society for the
express purpose of soliciting from the author an explanation of some parts of
his theory which seemed to them obscurely or equivocally expressed. To
this correspondence the amiablo and excellent prelate appears to havo given
every encouragement      ; and I have been told," adds Mr Stewart,
                                                                       " by tho best
authority, that he was accustomed to say that his reasonings had been no
where better understood than by this club of young Scotsmen."              To which
 Mr Stewart adds this note : The authority I here allude to is that of my
                                  "
 old friend and preceptor, Dr John Stevenson, who was himself a member of
                                     "
the Rankenian Club                      Mr Fraser justly remarks, that tho dates

tally well with this statement ; Berkeley's " Dialogues       having been published
in 1713, and tho Rankcnian        Club having    (as stated above)  been founded in
 1716.

8                     Proceedings       of the Royal        Society
of ceremonious          meetings     and    printing    lists of dignified office
bearers.      With      a  reticence    which we all must           regret,    the six
volumes of Medical Essays give no clue to the constitution of the
Society, the nature or frequency of its meetings, the names of the
presidents, nor even of the diligent secretary by whom, no doubt,
its Proceedings        were edited.*
    I think I     am   entitled to assume that the papers were fully equal
in point of merit to those contributed                on medical subjects to the
Royal Society of London, or any similar institution. They went
through more editions than one, were translated into foreign lan
guages, and were highly commended                  by the celebrated Haller.         It
is reasonable to believe that the wide reputation of the Edin
burgh     Medical School         dates from      the publication of these im
portant Essays.
    In  a paper on the       Climate of Edinburgh, which             I contributed    a
few years ago to the Royal Society's Transactions,f                  I  have brought
into view the early meteorological               observations     contained     in the
Medical Essays, though             by whom they were made               does   not ap
pear.
    The six volumes of Medical Essays terminated                       in 1744.     In
 1737, at the suggestion of the celebrated Maclaurin, the objects of
the Society       had already been extended             so as to    include general
science and literature.J           It had not existed for many years in this
form before political troubles antecedent to and during the insurrec
tion of 1745-6 seriously impaired its usefulness, and probably pre
vented the separate publication of its Transactions, which was from
the first contemplated. § The death of Maclaurin, in               June 1746, which
    * An incidental notice, however, in the Introduction         to the first volume  of
the Royal Society's Transactions,        informs us that the secretary was the first
 Professor Monro, who was also a largo contributor to the Essays.
    t Vol. xxii. p. 327.
    X The date usually assigned is 1739.        But from two letters of Maclaurin
 printed in the
                   " Scots' Magazine " for June 1804, the earlier date is certainly
 correct.   Mr David Laing has shown me a pamphlet (of sixtoen quarto pages)
containing the Regulations of the Society and a List of Members.               The List
of Members      is  dated   1739 ;  but at page  3, the  first Thursday of December
 1737 is fixed as the first day of meeting.
    § The papers read at the Society were in part printed in the later volumes
of the Medical Essays, in the Philosophical Transactions,          and in Maclaurin 's
Fluxions.    It appoars from a notice in Mr R. Chambers's Domestic Annals (vol.

                       of Edinburgh,      Session 1862-63.                        9
was       immediately traceable to his exertions on the side of the
English in the melancholy struggles of the period, was a heavy
blow to its usefulness, and a mass of papers connected with it were
found to have been in his possession, which could be only partially
recovered.        Some of these were published in 1754, under the title
of Essays and Observations, Physical and Literary, read                    before a
Society      in Edinburgh, and they were followed by two other volumes
in 1756 and 1771.          The first president of the Philosophical Society
was the Earl of Morton (afterwards president of the Royal Society
of London), Maclaurin and Dr Plummer (Professor of Chemistry)
were secretaries.        Afterwards Professor Monro (Secundus), and the
celebrated David Hume, acted as secretaries. The Society then held
its meetings        in the Advocates'      Library.     Medical subjects still
greatly predominated in the Transactions            ; but among the contribu
tors appear the names of Maclaurin, Lord Kames,*                  John Stewart
(Professor of Natural Philosophy), Matthew Stewart,                  Porterfield,
 Melvill, and Joseph Black.f
     It  is no small credit to this unpretending Society that          it not only
gave from its members two Presidents to the Royal Society                        of
London, but reckoned amongst its contributors perhaps the two
most eminent disciples of the Newtonian school which Britain pro
duced in the whole of the eighteenth century,            — namely, Colin Mac
laurin and Matthew Stewart.             The Philosophical Society of Edin
burgh was the immediate parent of the Royal Society.:):
     The Royal Society of Edinburgh took its rise in a meeting of the
 Professors of the University of Edinburgh, many of whom were also
members of the Philosophical Society,§ on the proposition                 of Prin-
iii.  p. 477), that, in 1743, the Society advertised for specimens of stones, ores,
 saline substances, bitumens, &c., to be sent to their secretary, Dr Plummer,
and    it  is stated that " the Society undertake, by some of their number, to
 make the proper trials at their own charge for discovering the nature and uses
of the minerals, and to return an answer to the person by whom they were sent,
if   they are judged to be of any use, or can be wrought to advantage."         The
 quotation is from the Edin. Evening Courant, 22d Aug. 1743.
    * Henry Home, Lord Kames, became president about 1769, and contributed
 greatly to the success of the Society.

 founded " on the model of         some    Foreign Academies,"      and so far dif
 fered from the Royal Society of London, that literary objects were
 equally promoted with science, and the interests of literature repre
                                    "
sented by a Literary " Class or subordinate Academy, having distinct
 meetings and office-bearers.          It  appears from a curious letter of Pro
 fessor Dalzel, in Professor Innes's          Life of Dakel,* that the Royal
Society    was more particularly modelled             on the Berlin Academy,
 and that its rise was partly due to          a  contest between Lord Buchan
 and the Society of Antiquaries on the one hand, and the University
and Faculty of Advocates             on the other.      The result, however, of
this party-war was in favour of the interests of science and literature ;
for the Society received        a  Royal Charter,      and was formally consti
tuted at a meeting held in the College              Library    on the 23d    June
1783, under the presidency            of Principal Robertson, at which were
also present the Lord Provost, Lord Justice-Clerk Miller, Profes
sors Cullen, Monro (Secundus), Hugh Blair, John Walker, Adam
Ferguson,     John Robison (who           was   then appointed secretary), the
Solicitor-General      Hay Campbell,           and    several   members    of the
Faculty of Advocates, the celebrated Adam Smith, and Mr Hunter
Blair, M.P. for the city of Edinburgh.
    The Society started at once into vigorous existence, and, looking
especially to the reputation of the members of the Literary Class,
few societies in any country have given a fairer prospect of a dis
tinguished career.        The members were either Resident, Non-Resi-
dent, or Honorary.         The number of Original Residents was 102,
and of Non-Residents, 71          ; and this before the Society had ever held
a meeting.       A short time later, the total number of members                be
longing    to the  Physical Class was 101, and to the Literary Class,
114.    An excerpt from the MS. list of original members, in Pro
fessor Robison 's handwriting (exclusive of those who have been
named as founders of the Society), will give no mean idea of the
eminent position of Edinburgh in the literary world of that day                 : —
6or  James Russell and Sir William Miller, Lord Glenlee.         The latter died so
lately as 184G, in his ninety-first year. The Minute-Books of the Philosophical
Society were expressly conveyed to the custody of the Royal Society (see
Minute, R.S., of 4th August 1783) ; but they aro, it may bo feared, now irre
coverably lost.

    The Physical Class included           Joseph Black, Clerk of Eldin,
Sir John Dalrymple (Lord Hailes), James Gregory, James Hutton,
John Playfair, Dugald Stewart, Lords Bute and Dundonald, Sir
James Hall, James Watt, Dr Small of Dundee, Patrick Wilson ; and
in the Literary Class we find the Lord President, Chief Baron, and
Lord Advocate,     John Home, David Hume, Henry Mackenzie, Alex
ander Tytler (Lord Woodhouselee), the Duke of Buccleuch, Archi
bald Alison, Dr Beattie,          Edmund Burke, Lord Morton, Lord
Hopetoun,    John Hunter of St Andrews, Thomas Reid, Young of
Glasgow, Dalzel, and Mr (afterwards Sir Robert) Liston.                 The
earliest meetings of the Royal Society (as well as that of its incor
poration) took place in the University Library.           A large subscrip
tion towards the erection      of the New College       was made by the
Society, on the understanding that the Society should be accommo
dated   within its walls;     and space was      actually allotted on the
north side of the building.       How this   was frustrated  I do not know.
The formal meetings continued          to take place usually in the same
place (the Library), at least until 1808, with an occasional substi
tution of the Physicians' Hall. In 1810, the Society purchased
a house, No. 40 George         Street,  where they    were accommodated
until 1826    ;  when   they removed to the rooms which they still
occupy, under a     lease from Government, in the Royal Institution
Building in Princes Street.
   I  proceed to trace rapidly the fortunes        of the Society, which
almost on the very day that          I  address you    has completed      the
eightieth year of its existence.
   The first President was the Duke of Buccleuch.               He was suc
ceeded   in 1812 by Sir James Hall, who, resigning in 1820, was
followed by Sir Walter Scott.         On the death of the latter in 1832,
Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane filled his place, to            be succeeded
at his decease in 1860 by the Duke of Argyll.            Thus   we have the
remarkable      and very unusual    fact, that the first four presidencies
endured over seventy-seven years.           The chief secretaryship has in
the same period      been held by only five individuals, of whom but
two were removed by death.
   The earliest period of the Royal Society,         and also the earliest
volumes of its Transactions,       were marked by the efficiency of the
literary department.       The first two volumes show       a substantial   if

  12              Proceedings       of the Royal       Society
 not precise equality in the extent of the published              contributions
 devoted to literature and to science.            The balance will even pre
 ponderate on the literary side,      if we  include the elegant biographies
 of deceased Fellows drawn up by accomplished authors.                    About
 1793  — only ten years from the origin of the Society            — the activity
 of the Literary Class had already become materially impaired.              But
 indeed at no period could        the literary papers bear comparison          in
 point of merit,  as a whole,    with those on science.          The great men
 of letters, who lent the weight of their names to the institution,
 bardly maintained its reputation by their pens. The Robertsons,
the Reids, the David Humes, the Fergusons,              and the Adam Smiths,
 hardly contributed   to the pages of the Transactions.
    It appears from the minutes of the Physical and Literary Classes
which   are now before me, that towards the end             of last century the
meetings of the Literary Class became rare — not averaging three in
a year — in consequence of the deficiency of communications.                  In
 1807, when, owing, to the interest excited by the geological discus
sions of the period,     in which Sir James          Hall, Professor Playfair,
 Lord Webb Seymour, Professor Jameson, Dr Thomas Thomson, Mr
Thomas Allan, and Mr Macknight took active parts, the business of
the Physical Class literally overflowed into the Literary Class, the
evenings appropriated       to the latter,     and not taken up by literary
papers, being devoted to science.         In   the following year the minute-
book of the Literary         Class   ceases     altogether,   and the separate
meetings    appear to have been discontinued           from that date (1808).
Afterwards    a few   literary papers were received at the ordinary
meetings,    without any attempt at separation.              It was, however,
only in 1827 that the distinction of the two classes was finally
abandoned in the annual election of office-bearers, and that, not
from any disinclination on the part of the Society to afford honour
able room to literary papers, but simply from the cessation of such
communications.      It   is perfectly understood that a renewal of these
would be considered       to be a credit    to the Society, and     I hope that
our literary friends    will  be induced      to give us the benefit of their
support and their contributions.
    With the exception of the Literary Class, the Proceedings of the
Society were at no time marked by more energy and importance
than during the first twelve or fifteen years of the present century,

                     of Edinburgh,        Session 1862-63.                     13
 when the geological       discussions      to which   I  have referred      made
 Edinburgh the chief centre of information on such subjects.                 They
 gave rise to the masterly papers of Sir James Hall, with which at
 that time the Transactions         were   enriched.*     These were followed
 or accompanied by the early communications             of Sir David Brewster
on Polarization and other parts of Optics, which added much to tho
 scientific reputation of the Society.
    The accession of Sir Walter Scott to the presidency in 1820 did
not reanimate the Literary section of the Society.              He contributed
no paper, although       he at one time very regularly presided at the
ordinary meetings.        From 1832, when the printing of the " Pro
ceedings" at every meeting commenced, to the present time, nothing
in the history of the Society calls for special remark.              During that
period, as at former ones, there have been fluctuations              in the pros
perity of the Society, both as regards the number and value of the
communications       received, and the interest taken in the meetings
by the Fellows at large and by the general                 public.    That such
must    occur   the founders      of the Royal Society were sufficiently
aware.     At the very opening of our Transactions we find it ob
served, that
                " Institutions of this kind have their intervals of lan
guor as well as their periods            of brilliancy and activity.       Every
associated    body must receive its vigour from             a few zealous and
spirited individuals who find a pleasure in that species of business,
which, were it left to the care of the members in general, would be
often reluctantly submitted         to, and always negligently executed.
The temporary avocations, and still more the deaths of such men,
have the most sensible effects on the societies to which they be
longed.     The principle of activity which animated               them,   if not
utterly extinguished, remains long dormant, and a kindred genius is
required to call it into life."f         The truth of these remarks must be
apparent to all who have had experience              in such matters.       They
ought to     encourage     us to keep alive the        interest    of our meet
ings, and to maintain the character of our Society at times when
   * The last meeting at which Sir Jaines Hall appears to have presided, was
that of the 6th June 1820.    He resigned tho presidency in November follow

the Strata of the Earth," was read in March 1825.

either may appear to be in danger of flagging, resting well assured
that the development of knowledge, and the intellectual resources
of new generations,          will ever from time to time give lustre and
importance      to associations destined          not to meet the caprices or
fashions of a time, but to promote the great cause of scientific and
literary progress.
    III. — I  now proceed to consider             what changes     the  progress   of
science or   of society    renders   necessary or desirable     in  the  working of
associations such as      the  Royal   Society, and    how  far  such chanyes    are
safe and prudent      f
    The most casual reader of history, or observer of men, knows
that the inevitable progress of change — material, intellectual, and
social — deprives of the character of permanence all human institu
tions.     Those     Institutions     are   most likely to be perpetuated, in
which    a wise forecast     of progressive change adapts their parts to the
wants and circumstances of the age.                  If this be true of political
Constitutions, of Churches, of Universities, of Charities, nay even
of public Amusements, it is no            less true  of learned Societies.     Con
sidering that the Royal Society of London and the French Academy
of Sciences are each two centuries old, we rather must wonder —
taking into view the astonishing progress, or indeed reconstruction,
of the sciences during that time — that so much of their original
constitution     still remains, than that changes have been needed, or
are still required, to meet the wants of successive generations.
    I shall  consider some of the most obvious changes of condition
under which learned            associations     pursue their vocation      now and
formerly.      In   doing so,     I shall speak principally of their relations
to the natural and experimental             sciences.
    The Florentine Academy was an excellent type of what a physical
association of the seventeenth century was and ought to have been.
 The members collected apparatus, they had                 a laboratory,   they fur
 nished funds for these        ;  and the associated philosophers (who were
select in number)        met to witness the experiments, and to argue
upon the conclusions to be drawn from them.                    The Royal Society
of London,      as   well   as   the lesser societies from which it sprung,
took a precisely        similar course      :  they had a paid       Operator    and
 Editor of their Transactions        ;  and they remitted to individual mem

                    of Edinburgh,      Session 1862-63.
bere or  small committees to try experiments, and to report the               re
sults to a succeeding meeting.
    This seems to be the most perfect constitution of a sociefy for
investigating nature which we can well imagine.                It bears a close
analogy to the Philosophical College of Bacon,         — the Solomon's House
in the allegory of the New Atlantis,      — which is generally believed to
have been     really an antecedent (in the way of suggestion) to the
formation of the Royal Society of London. But it is now less prac
ticable than formerly, for many reasons, of which           I   will enumerate
a few.    For example, these Societies include in our time              so many
members that they can no longer consult as a committee, but must
rather listen as an audience.         Again, the minute subdivisions into
which the sciences are now split, render a perfect comprehension               of
one science alone almost the occupation         of a single  life. Hence, un
less  such  a society were to consist all of chemists, all of astronomers,
all of comparative anatomists, and so forth, the proceedings, and even
the experiments,      which in a former      age interested nearly      all well-
informed men alike, are now interesting or intelligible to only a
 small section.     In like manner, an experimental investigation is no
 longer the simple and absolute thing which it was. A member of
 the Royal Society is no longer instructed, as in former times, to try,
 for instance, whether      spirit of wine burns or not in        an exhausted
 receiver;   whether salt is separated from water in freezing; to dis
 sect an oyster; to measure whether            pebbles and other         minerals
 grow or not   ;  whether    eggs frozen    continue   fecund   ;  to repeat the
 Magdeburg     and Torricellian experiments; to determine the relative
 weight of lead and water;        and to report the result of any such ex
 periment at next week's meeting.*        But the investigations are now-a-
 days complicated, the experimental means alone furnish matter for
  long and anxious preliminary consideration         ;  the precision     needed,
  and  the calculations   on   which it depends,     are  matters consuming
  time, and often can be better attained by the patient             efforts of an
 individual, than through         any  amount     of co-operation    ;  nay, the
 very results,   unless involving a capital      discovery (which is a rare
 and fortunate     accident),   cannot   be stated without an amount of
 detail often wearisome to those who are not especially               interested.
    • Theso instances are all taken from the early Journals of the Royal Society
 of London.

 16                Proceedings       of the Royal Society
These, among others, are causes why men cannot now do the hard
work of science in their collective          capacity as associations.      How
rarely do we even see two philosophers (at least in this country)
engaged in a common investigation !
    One result    of what has     been    stated is the breaking       down    of
scientific  communities      into special      aggregations     or societies  for
the promotion, say, of astronomy, or geology, or chemistry,              or even
minuter    subjects,    such as microscopic        anatomy,    numismatics,    or
entomology.       Such associations      bear testimony       to the difficulty,
which increases year by year, of rendering the sciences intelligible
and interesting,     in respect of new discoveries, to the mass of even
well-educated     men.     They   are bo far a protest      against the utility
of associations at all, since they tend to reduce the prosecution of
science more and more to an individual affair.
    In communities      less numerous and comprehensive than those of
London or Paris, the difficulty is not less felt, though the means of
meeting it (at least temporarily) are not so attainable. The largest
provincial town or district cannot possibly maintain the group of
associations which, even in London, may be said to enjoy a preca
rious intellectual subsistence.         I do not mean to say, that more
subordinate     special associations are unadvisable,         even  in the pro
 vinces  ; on the contrary,     I  believe that they       may do much      good.
But one may fairly deprecate the encouragement of a spirit of
 rivalry towards the larger and more national and permanent insti
tutions which     already exist,    such as the Royal Society may fairly
claim to be.      To maintain the character, for energy and stability,
of one central Society, is in reality the common interest of all of
that not very numerous body of persons who cultivate science for
its own sake.        Delightful and instructive meetings may advan
tageously    be  held by a local body of geologists or chemists, or
naturalists; but       such   associations      require   immense    vitality to
 be permanent.        Practically, they     fall into abeyance, in perhaps
twenty or thirty years, or even less          ;  and   if they have attempted
to record their labours by publication,             these publications    having
never attained     more than      a  very limited circulation, become         in
accessible and      forgotten.     The matured written         results of those
labours which properly form a subject of almost private discussion
in minor societies, are best consigned for final preservation to the

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1862-63.                          17
 publications of a central and enduring association.        A good example
 of what   I here intend to indicate,  may be found in a private Parisian
 Society, founded early in this century,       called  La  Societi d'Arceuil,
 from the name of the country-house        of its president, Count Berthol-
 let, where   it met.   It consisted of the elite of the French Academy
of Sciences, including Laplace, Humboldt, Gay Lussac, Biot, Arago,
 Decandolle, &c. But the Memoirs (in three volumes) published by
 this most distinguished     and delightful club, including such papers
 of capital importance as Malus's original one on the Polariza
tion of Light, Humboldt's on the Isothermal Lines, Thenard on
 Ethers, and Arago on the Colours of Thin Plates, must be con
sidered as in fact withheld from the Proceedings of the national
Academy, and they must now be sought for consultation              in  a small
printed collection in the hands comparatively          of few.   It  is need
less to add, that the Society lasted for but a few years.
    I may also include among the causes          which have of late years
affected the prosperity of our own and similar societies, that ten
dency to centralization which, during the last half century, has
affected so many interests, political, social, commercial,           and also
scientific and literary.     The facility of communication        with Lon
don has facilitated that tendency to southward emigration,            so long,
and not unjustly, attributed to Scotchmen.             But far from aiding
their return, the facility     seems   to be all in one direction.        The
larger arena for practical    talent to  be found     in the metropolis at
tracts even our writers of literary essays, and our labourers in the
cause of physical science.      It is a fact which admits of no doubt,
that the Scottish      Geological   School, which once made Edinburgh
famous, especially when the Vulcanist          and Neptunian     War raged
simultaneously     in the hall of this Society and in the class-rooms of
the University, may almost be said to have been transported bodily
to Burlington House.       Roderick Murchison, Charles Lyell, Leonard
Horner,    are Scottish  names, and the bearers of them are Scottish in
everything    save residence.     Even the field of their labours is in no
small measure Scottish     ; and the Silurian standard is waved over half
the length and breadth of our     " primitive" Highlands.      Our younger
men    are drafted off as soon as their acquirements        become known.

 townsman        Mr Geikie volunteers for our instruction, so long as the
 central forces of Jermyn Street suffer him to linger within the
 Scottish border.         Others, who still reside in Scotland, not unnatu
 rally seek     a larger   audience,     and a more rapid    publicity for their
 memoirs, by transmitting them to London.                This is reasonable and
 inevitable.       Yet  a certain   feeling of patriotism might still retain a
[portion of their labours for the Transactions of our Scottish Royal
•Society. Indeed, it is remarkable that the centralization of which
1 ihave spoken seems          to reside in London chiefly       ; for we do not
iind much tendency in Scottish towns or universities (with a few
honourable        exceptions)    to contribute to the literary and scientific
'wealth of our national metropolis.            I believe that the original list of
 the Royal Society of 1783 includes more provincial members, at                 all
 events from the Universities, than we can reckon in 1862.              Of all the
 changes which have befallen Scottish science during the last half
century, that which        I most deeply     deplore, and at the same time won
 der   at,  is tho progressive        decay of our once illustrious Geological
 School.       Centralization may account for it in part, but not entirely.
    But    I  have allowed myself to be partly withdrawn from the enu
 meration of the causes of change which have affected the business
 and functions of societies for the promotion             of science and litera
 ture.     Another of these is the alteration of domestic habits in some
 important particulars.         Most of the older societies commenced in
  Clubs, which met at taverns, in conformity with the all but uni
 versal usage of the period.               The " Philosophical Club," which
 foreshadowed        the Royal Society       of London, met in 1649 at the
  Bull's Head in Cheapside          ;  and the germ of the Royal Society         of
  Edinburgh was a club meeting at Ranken's Tavern. All this is
  past and gone.         The Drydens, the Addisons, and the Johnsons of
 our day, hold forth no longer at               "Will's" or "The Mitre." If
 a more domestic, we are           certainly a less " clubable" generation.*
 The effect tells even upon our literary and scientific undertak
 ings.      The clubs of modern London are rather institutions for the
 luxurious accommodation of individuals than for social intercourse ;
 and the attempt of Sir H. Davy and others to combine them
  systematically with literary conversation, in the case of the
                                                                           " Athe-

neeum," proved a failure.          An analogous influence is found in the
vast    expansion      of intellectual intercourse through the means of
the press, and in the filtering of knowledge of all kinds —of scien
tific knowledge, perhaps, especially — through the widely extended
system of popular lectures.         In  these two features of the age, we
find    sufficient   reasons alone to account      for much of the social
change      to which     I  have referred.    Newspapers,   magazines,  and
ephemeral       literature of every kind, supplant the oral intercom
munication characteristic of the days of clubs.               A man takes
home with him to his fireside the gossip, the jokes, the discoveries,
the discussions,        grave or gay,    of the day. And in matters of
science it issomewhat the same. Much he finds of all that is most
occupying the thoughts of able men pursuing natural knowledge
set down in the pages of the " Athenaeum," or " Macmillan," or
 " Good Words,"         perhaps by the very persons who really are most
 able to speak of such things.         Nothing of importance can be com
 municated to a society which does not soon become matter of public
 notoriety through such channels.
     But still wider is the influence       of those popular discourses or
 lectures which now practically supply to many persons of general
 information, but not professed students, the intellectual interest
 formerly sought in the meetings of our learned Societies, and I
 believe     I  might add, in the case of Edinburgh, in some measure
 from our University courses also.           The Royal Institution of Lon
 don commenced           this system with splendid     advantages,   and  its
  popularity (which could scarcely increase) has been maintained
  with little if any diminution for sixty years. But in fulfilling
  its own task of instructing intelligent persons in the latest results
  of scientific discovery, often from the very mouths of the discoverers
  themselves, it has deprived of one great attraction the meetings
  of the Royal Society, the great fountain and source whence such
  knowledge       ought   naturally to flow.    Similar influences have pre
   vailed in Edinburgh, to the diminution of the attendance in this
   place.    Those who can look back to the audiences assembled in
   this room when ordinary scientific       papers were read, from twenty-
   five to  thirty years     ago, will corroborate my testimony    as to the
   change     which less than even one generation has brought about.

provement in the first place, and the charm of           a  periodical,  a   fort
nightly meeting with like-minded persons (seldom perhaps met
 with in the interval), counteracted the tendency to criticise, and the
intolerance    of hearing something read not immediately or directly
interesting to the hearer.
   Were    I  to enumerate         the names     of that   large hand of our
fellow-citizens, our       professors,     our  distinguished     lawyers,    our
country gentlemen       and mere amateurs,•who, meeting after meet
ing, used    to occupy     almost the same        individual places on these
benches, so that their loss or absence             could in a moment have
 been noticed —    I should recall to many, even now present, the             dif
ferent phase, in this respect, which the society of Edinburgh                pre
sented then from now.           Let me first name, almost at hazard,       a few
of those whose images live in my memory              as I now address you,      as
among those who as a rule attended, and as a raro               exception were
absent  : There was the ever animated, zealous, and punctual presi
dent, Sir Thomas Brisbane ; the polite and decorous Dr Hope j
the indefatigable, unassuming Lord Greenock ; the sagacious Dr
Abercrombie     ;  the  lively, unresting Sir George Mackenzie ; the
 hospitable    Professor Russell (whoso academic suppers are not
even now forgotten)      ;  the beneficent,    large-minded    Dr Alison   ;  the
kindly, genial Professor Wallace, close to whom usually sat Mr
James Jardine, with his finely chiselled features and intellectual
forehead, the accurate       Mr Adie, and the conscientious,        modest as
tronomer,    Mr Henderson        :  there was also the ingenious      Sir John
Robison, fertile in expedients         ; the frank and manly      Dr Graham       ;
the quietly humorous         and ornithological      Mr James Wilson       ;  the
encyclopaedic     Dr Traill   ;    and the shrewd and well read, but re
served  Mr W. A. Cadell.           Besides, there were many others who,          if
they rarely took an active part in the business of the Society, were
not the less persevering in their attendance,         — thus giving    evidence
of an interest in its welfare and permanence, which any exigency,
or even opportunity, would have called in action : there were Sir
Henry Jardine and Lord Meadowbank; Dr Brunton and Dr Neill,
occupying probably the same bench with Mr R. Stevenson and Mi-
Bald; Mr John Craig, Sir William Newbigging, Professor                     J.   S.
More,  Mr William Wood, Archdeacon Williams, Mr George Swin-
ton, Sir Joseph Straton, Dr Borthwick, and Mr Stark.                I could far

more     than double the list by including those who, though not ab
solutely regularly, attended so frequently that their faces were
familiar in this room, and their presence missed in the social
gathering round the tea-table later in the evening.
    I   fear, gentlemen,       that we now-a-days allow ourselves to become
too     mechanically intellectual, and also too intellectually fastidious.
If    the recent movement which has been set on foot for deepening
and     enlarging the interest felt by the members in our meetings is
to    take any root and produce any results,             I am persuaded that it
must be, though not solely, yet mainly by our Fellows recollecting
that though the meetings               of the Royal Society      are   intended  for
the communication of knowledge                  by the reading      of papers, they
always were, and          still are, intended quite as much to promote a cor
dial feeling amongst those (at best but a small number in the
 midst of a teeming and busy population) wbo profess an interest in
 the progress of literature and science, and whose presence and con
 versation      may contribute       to this end, as well as the more formal
 contributions of others.            I ask the more numerous portion of our
 Associates,       if  they   are  not disposed to contribute         papers to our
 meetings,       at least to make a      contribution of    themselves — their per
 sonal attendance, their approving             interest, their mite of influence
 towards       our commonwealth         of letters.    We have      seen  how much
 popular      lectures have done elsewhere towards            individual improve
 ment, and the increase of a certain                kind of knowledge       amongst
 various classes      ;  we have attributed a     still wider and more beneficial
 influence      to the periodical literature of the day           ;  but neither of
 these      is a social form of scientific and literary effort. It is that
 which we claim as one of the two remaining (perhaps only perma
 nent) functions of our great Societies planted in different times from
 the present : the one is to afford to authors, especially to the
 authors of learned dissertations            on science, the means (otherwise
 wholly unattainable) of bringing their labours in a printed form
 before the scientific public ; the other function is to encourage, by an
 expression      of personal sympathy and interest, the labours of those
 wbo devote themselves            to the too often ungrateful toil of original
 investigation.*         To the utility of the first, our Transactions bear,       I

22                  Proceedings      of the Royal Society
will take it upon me to say, satisfactory testimony.             Of these Scot
land has just cause to be proud.             Nor, on the whole, have wo to
complain of any deterioration in the memoirs by which this Society
becomes known to the learned world.                The second fulfilment of
our objects of incorporation       seems   in some danger of being forgot
ten.     While the older members of the Society must feel             a pleasure
in meeting, fortnight by fortnight, those with whom they worked in
earlier days, or with whom they perhaps strove in generous rivalry,
thus     keeping    alive   those embers of mutual         interest  which the
changing gales of life are too ready to disperse and extinguish,
they may also lend their countenance to the efforts of younger men
who     are  treading     in   their steps, and who may soon, if they
have not already done so, occupy their own seats of influence or
of honour.       They may thus aid in giving coherence to the chain
which binds generation to generation in the pursuit of truth, and
in establishing a "personal relation between the intellect of each, the
impressive influence of which we are too apt to forget.              I say,  gen
tlemen, that this is a personal affair, which no abstract ideas can
supersede, —    I  say that no popular lecture, listened        to by hundreds
of persons immediately to be dispersed into their specific individu
ality, no perusal of scientific digests in the study or at the fire-
tion of personal interconrso amongst literary men — we may add a third, that of
 rewarding meritorious papers or discoveries by medals and other more or less
 honorary distinctions.    Such have existed 'both in British and Foreign Socie
 ties from an early period until the present. They are of two classes : rewards
 offered by anticipation for researches on definite subjects proposed (this
 obtains mostly abroad) ; and premiums awarded to the best paper or most con
 siderable discovery, either in science generally, or in some specified branch of
 it. This last form is more usual in this country ; and such premiums are our
 Keith, Brisbane, and Neill medals. I think wo must conclude that the
 foreign system has worked best.      Many considerable memoirs of the last cen
 tury on physical astronomy and similar subjects were offered in competition
 for such prizes.    The stimulus is one which addresses itself variously to dif
 ferent minds, and on the whole seems to be less effective in these later times.
 One disadvantage of the award of medals for researches not previously defined,
 is the greater difficulty of awarding them without partiality or bias. A fourth
 kind of encouragement to science which our societies sometimes exert is the
 bestowal of funds for the prosecution of experimental investigations.      This is
 frequently a stimulus of no small value. It was first systematically applied
 in this country by the British Association ; aud tho Government of the coun
 try have wisely committed an aunual fund for such purposos to be dispensed
 by tho Royal Society of London.

side, can replace such influences.         I could speak from personal ex
perience,   if  necessary, of the influence     of meetings like ours, dull
and commonplace though they may appear to some, upon the mind
of the young student ; of the zest with which he feels himself, per
haps for the first time, made the recipient of knowledge in its actual
dynamic progress, not through its past hoarded acquisitions merely ;
the enthusiasm with which he sees (perhaps also for the first time)
men of whom he has read in books, and on whom ho looks with pos
sibly excessive, yet still elevating and generous respect       ;  how, meet
ing after meeting, he approaches somewhat nearer to those thus dis
tantly regarded, and finally addresses them, though with something
of reverence,     as friends    having a common interest in common and
 noble pursuits.      If such    alone were a result of our periodical    meet
 ings, such would alone be         an adequate object  for us to aim at.      It
 is only by a certain measure of self-denial, a certain throwing off
 of passive or indolent habits, that we can hope to render our meet
  ings attractive to ourselves and to one another.           If   all come, all
 will be interested ; let each man, instead of pleading his inability
 to contribute his share to the literary and scientific           proceedings,
  contribute at least his countenance.        There is something magnetic
  in the concourse of intelligent persons. Not only does each ele
 ment attracted increase the aggregate by its adhesion, but the
 aggregate     so increased     draws   new molecules    with greater      force
 within its sphere,     till the whole   gathers in an increasing      progres
 sion, and (as physical philosophers tell us) evolves by the mere
  act of aggregation that heat and light which maintain energy and
  vitality even to the bounds of the universe.
     We all know the history of the British Association for the Ad
  vancement of Science ; some here remember its origin ; few have not
  been present at some      of its meetings. Let me remind you how small
  a fraction of that animated whole is composed of direct contributors
  to the advancement of those sciences which the Society was formed
  to promote.      Let me ask you, what would         be the  result   if every
  member were requested to withdraw,          who had not some paper to
 communicate       or some remark to offer.      You may imagine the dire
 scramble which would ensue, the clearing of benches, the faces of
 dismay.     The dismay would not be all on the side of the retreating
 listeners.     The small knot of studious philosophers left behind

 24                   Proceedings       of the Royal       Society
 would feel discouraged by the removal               of that sympathising audi
 tory.    Have      we  not all heard with patience,             sometimes     almost
 with interest and admiration,             papers read, from which we must
 afterwards     have confessed to ourselves            if  not to others     that we
 were able to carry little or nothing away?               Yet that intelligent con
 course of partially instructed            persons gives life to the meeting,
 sanction     and encouragement           to the really knowing, a taste for
 knowledge,      respect for its professors, and some portions               at least
of positive acquirements to those who are not so.                     I believe that
 we ignore too much this element as inherent in the constitu
tion of our learned societies.             If  we continue to do so, we shall
degenerate      (I   venture     to call it a degeneracy)       into mere publish
ing clubs, whose Transactions             are read by a      select few, but which
exist and shine by          a   mere " lumen siccum," — disembodied              exis
tences claiming no sympathies, calling forth no regard, combining
no diversities      of interest.*
   * I may perhaps be allowed to call attention to a striking change (on the
wholo) in the character of the publications of learned societies ;        I mean the
great detail into which the papers generally run, especially in thoso on expe
rimental    Physics,   mixed Mathematics,      and Natural History.      The bulk of
these communications      is, it  may be feared, too often out of proportion    to the
intrinsic value of the matter which they contain.          It is by no means without
example to see the pages of Transactions (as well Foreign as British) occupied by
a description of experiments of which the results were merely negative, and by
mathematical     investigations with no less indefinite conclusions.      Such papers
are rarely read by any one.        They increase the bulk and expense of Trans
actions, and bewilder the unaided student.         Even in cases less extreme they
are encumbrances to scientific literature.         An author, wbo has before him
no fear of a printer's bill, or the remonstrances of an impatient publisher, is
but too apt to please himself      by expanding a small amount of matter over a
goodly number of those handsome quarto pages, in which his lucubrations
appear so advantageously to the eye.         Even where numerical precision in the
results is of primary consequence, excessive elaboration in printing the steps
of calculation and instrumental corrections is often unnecessary, as well as
extreme minuteness in describing forms of apparatus, and results of chemical
reactions, especially where such details are not remote from common appre
hension.    A  stricter editorial censorship than the Councils of societies usually
venture to exert (similar in kind, though not in degree, to that which the
editors of our leading periodicals exercise over contributors not less eminent
in their departments),    seems to be called for, by the      expanding  bulk of the
volumes published by learned Bodies.
   An evil nearly allied to this, is the fragmentary manner in which authors
nro apt to contribute the results     of their inquiries.   This is a consequence of

   The past year has produced more than the usual number                                         of
 casualties both on the home and foreign lists of the Society.                                Dur
 ing its course the Society has had to deplore, in common with the
 whole British Empire, the premature decease of H.R.H. the Prince-
 Consort.       It   would be out of place here to offer a detailed                         eulogy
 on one whose connection               with our body was comparatively                       slight
 and indirect,        but whose loss has been profoundly felt in nearly
 every home in these islands.                An enlightened patronage of Science
 and the Arts was one of the especial characteristics                      of his patriotic,
 unselfish,     and too short life.
   Amongst Foreign and Honorary Fellows                        we miss three,                all of
 whom      were      on the verge of, or had exceeded, fourscore                             years.
 These    would by themselves               afford topics for an address.                   I must
allude to them very briefly.
   The venerable Jeah-Baptiste                     Biot was born 21st April 1774.
He has been an Honorary Member of this Society for the uncommon
period of forty-seven years, having been elected in January 1815.*
He had become a member of the French Academy of Sciences in
 1803, his jubilee having been celebrated                    nearly        ten years ago.
But it is also  singular and probably unprecedented fact, that at
                     a
the time of his death he was a member of three out of four of the
Academies         composing      the Institute         of France   ;       that       is,   of the
Academie        Frangaise,     and that of Inscriptions and Belles Leltres,
the struggle for priority in even second and third rate results of scientific in
vestigation, though these are often no more than corollaries to propositions
well established, or assumed     to be so. Such caveatt are better adapted for the
weekly or monthly       journals, where they properly and reasonably find                        a
place.    It   seems to be the business of societies to consult more than they
usually   do, the instruction     and convenience of readers, and less exclusively
the sometimes inconsiderate   demands on the part of authors. There is,
perhaps, no society to which these remarks do not more or less apply but                     ;
the case of the Compta Sendut of the French Academy of Sciences supplies
an example of excessive        publication    bo   generally admitted to be an embar
rassing evil that   may be referred to as
                     it                    warning.a
 * I   find by the old minute-books of this Society, that  paper by Biot on
                                                                       a
the Polarization of Light by Crystals, was read by Sir David (then Dr)
Brewster at the ordinary meeting of the 16th January 1815.

   26                 Proceedings        of the Royal Society
   as well as   of the Academy of Sciences.           His diversified abilities as
   an author are well exemplified in the miscellaneous writings col
   lected by him before his death under the title of Melanges Scienti-
  fiqy.es et Litteraires.*
       His fame, however, chiefly rests on his scientific productions,
   especially in connection with the polarization of light.              His writ
   ings on astronomy,          though voluminous,       are  not original, except,
   perhaps, in their historical and antiquarian             aspect.   Even in his
   own subject, that of optics, there did not fall to his share so many
   capital discoveries       as from    his opportunities,  zeal, and unbounded
   perseverance,     might perhaps have been expected. His discovery
   (independently of Seebeck) of the rotation of the plane of polariza-
.  tion caused by liquids, is the chief of these, and he pursued it
   with unflagging energy into its numerous consequences during at
   least forty years.         Biot was an instance of all that mere talent
   and perseverance, unsustained             by great genius, can attain.        His
   long life was one         scene    of intellectual labour from first to last.
    Brought up at the feet of the great Laplace, he was perfectly
   conversant with his writings, and with all that belonged to the
   most advanced state of mathematics of the time.                  His optical   re
    searches were pursued           according   to the traditions of the same
   school, as contained in the Emission- or Corpuscular-Theory.               First
    in his latest years did he begin to betray              a consciousness     that
    Young, Fresnel, and Arago might be right, and that light is an
    undulation after all.        But the imperfect concession had then lost
    all grace. His theory of Moveable Polarization, and generally his
    modes of conceiving complex physical phenomena, were more ela
    borate than satisfactory.
       One of Biot's most considerable          contributions to science was his
    determination     of the length of the seconds-pendulum in different
    latitudes.    It was the occasion of (I believe) his only visit to
    Scotland, which took place in the summer of 1817, when he made
    numerous observations at Leith Fort, and then undertook                his me
    morable journey to the Isle of Unst, the northmost of the Shetlands,
    of which he has left an interesting memorial in the first volume
    of his published Essays.f Thus he had the no small distinction

of having carried      on these important labours,       under very great
difficulties, over a terrestrial arc of 22° of latitude, extending from
the Isle of Ivica in the Mediterranean, to that of Unst, not very far
from the Arctic Circle.      Of his true devotion to the scientific career
which he had proposed to himself, it is impossible to speak too
strongly. No distinctions except literary ones had any attraction
for him. He carefully eschewed those political promotions coveted
by too many of his academic compeers.              His views on politics,
though definitely monarchical, were never obtruded. The isolation
induced by his habits of unremitting study fostered a coldness of
disposition often manifested by him towards other scientific men.
He had few intimate friends out of his- family circle, and his
encouragement      towards young     aspirants  was   cautious  and inter
mitting.     It is worthy of being added in his favour,        that during
the last thirty years of his life he recognised, in a marked manner,
the obligations    of his religious creed.     Notwithstanding his very
advanced     age, he continued    his studies on Indian astronomy to
within   a very short time   of his death, which he met with Christian
composure, on the 3d February 1862, when he had nearly completed
his eighty-eighth year.
     Fiukdrich Tiedejiann, the eminent anatomist and physiologist,
 was born at Cassel   in 1781, and died on the 22d January 1861, in
 the eightieth year of his age.       His death was inadvertently not
 noticed at our last anniversary.      Tiedemann was one of the most
eminent comparative anatomists and physiologists of Europe.            His
earliest   paper of note, that on the Circulation of the Echinoder-
 mata, obtained a prize offered by the French Academy of Sciences.
 He became Professor of Anatomy at Heidelberg in 1816, and con
 tinued so until 1848.       During this period he published a cele
 brated work on the Human Brain, and another               on that  of the
 Monkey,    as  well as several works    in conjunction with Oppel and
 Treviranus. He was blind during some of the later years of his
 life, but recovered his sight through an operation for cataract.
 Subsequent to bis leaving Heidelberg,       he lived in great retirement
 at Bremen and Frankfort.
     Louis Albert Necker,    honorary Professor of Mineralogy and Geo

28                Proceedings     of the Royal Society
logy at Geneva, was born there in 1786, and died at Portree, in the
Isle of Skye, on the 20th November 1862, in his seventy-sixth year.
Mr Necker was far more intimately connected with this country
and with this Society than our foreign members usually are         ;  indeed
he might be called a naturalised          Scotchman,   and he contributed
papers to our Transactions.        It was    my intention to have entered
on his biography here at some length.          But  I think it will be best
to bring before the Society in a separate form the facts and re
miniscences which     I  have to offer.
   On our home list, we have to lament the loss of 12 of our Ordi
nary Fellows    ; a considerable   number of whom had, however, also
attained the full term of human         life.  Their names    are, — Robert
Bald, John Cockburn,        Norwich Duff, James Forsyth, James P.
Fraser,  John Fyfe,   J. Burn Murdoch, James Russell,* John Russell,
Thomas     Stewart   Traill, James Walker, and Alex. Maconochie
Wei wood.
   To replace these we reckon also    12 new    Fellows, — namely, Profes
sor Archer, Rev.    W. G. Blaikie, Mr Henry Cheyne, Mr Nicholas A.
Dalzell, Mr A. M. Edwards, Rev. V. G. Faithful, Dr James Hector,
Dr J. P. Macartney, Dr W. B. Mackinlay, Mr Edward F. Maitland
(now Lord Barcaple), Dr E. Ronalds, and Rev. Robert B. Watson.
   Our numbers, therefore, remain the same         as last year.
   I must confine myself to a very short obituary notice of a few of
our deceased    Fellows who showed most interest in the proceedings
of the Society.
   The senior in standing as   a Fellow    was Mr Alexander Maconochik
Welwood,      better known during his active life here as Lord Mea-
dowbank.      His father also bore the same title        ; and was    a man
of much acuteness, and an original Fellow of this Society.               The
late Mr Maconochie       Welwood was born in March 1777, he joined
the Faculty of Advocates        in 1799, was made Lord Advocate            in
1816, and a    Judge in 1819. He retired from the Bench in 1843.
He joined this Society in 1817, but was not, so far as           I   know, a
contributor to our Proceedings.       He, however, took an interest in
them,   and for many years attended the meetings regularly.               He
had a large circle of acquaintances in and out of the Society ; and

  though in   public matters his manner         was occasionally  dogmatic, he
 was   of a kind and hospitable nature, and was much regarded by a
 large circle     of personal friends.     The frequency of his attendance
 here contributed to excite a spirit of interest in the meetings.           For
 about twenty years past he had lived in calm retirement in the
 midst of his family, and on the property which he had an heredi
tary pride      in cultivating and adorning.         He died at Meadowbank
on the     30th November 1861, in the eighty-fifth year of his age.
    Elected    in the same year with Mr M. Welwood, but his senior
by one     year, was Mr Robert Bald, who for many years occupied a
very    high position      as a mining engineer.    He  was born at Culross,  in
Perthshire,       in  1776, and soon after removed to Alloa, where he early
gave his     attention to mining, and attracted the notice of the Earl
of Marr.        He was ultimately engaged in the extensive Marr Col
lieries,  —a      connection    which he held for    a very  long period.    He
commenced general             practice  as a  mining engineer in Edinburgh
about the        year    1820, and was very extensively employed in Scot
land,    England, and Wales.         He was requested by the Swedish Govern
ment to     report on the coalfields of that kingdom, and received from
the    King of Sweden marked acknowledgments of the value attached
 to   his report by the Government           of that country.     Mr Bald was
 elected a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1817, and
 was a contributor to its Proceedings.            He was author of a " View
 of the   Coal Trade,"* of the article " Mine" in the Edinburgh Ency
 clopaedia, and of numerous other papers bearing on his profession.
 Mr Bald was universally esteemed             ;  and during his long stay in
 Edinburgh he formed many lasting friendships, which death alone
 terminated.          He was for long in ill health, and bore his protracted
 and severe      illness with truly Christian resignation.      The latter years
  of his once active life were spent in retirement at Alloa, where he
 died    in December 1861, in his eighty-sixth year.
     As connected by the nature of his occupations             with Mr Bald,    I
  uext notice        a third octogenarian     among   our Fellows,   Mr James
    *  In this work he made a benevolent and much required appeal on behalf
 of the miserable      lot of women then employed in coal mines, under the name
 of " Bearers. "

Walker, the eminent civil engineer, who         was   born at  Falkirk on
the 14th of September 1781.        He  was educated at the parish school
of Falkirk, and thereafter       removed to Glasgow,    where he studied
at the University.     He went to London in the year 1800, and com
menced the study of engineering under his uncle the late Ralph
Walker, who was then engaged in constructing the West India
Docks.     Mr Walker devoted himself almost exclusively to marine
engineering,   in which important      branch of the profession, though
his rise was gradual, he ultimately attained the position of the first
authority of his day. He had not      a very inventive cast of mind, but
he had great caution and sound judgment, and above all the faculty
of profiting by his large and varied experience.         His works were,
in consequence, eminently successful.        It would  be out  of place in
this brief notice to attempt even an outline of his works, so varied
were they in character, and so many in number.            It may be suffi
cient to say that    at the time of his death he was conducting,         as
Government      engineer, the national harbours     of refuge at Dover,
Alderney, and Jersey, and the refuge harbour at the mouth of the
Tyne. As engineer to the Trinity House of London, he constructed
various lighthouses,     including that on the Bishop's Rock, a very
exposed situation.      He was largely consulted in navigation and
canal works  ;   and the Stockwell    Street Bridge at Glasgow may be
adduced as a favourable specimen of his bridge architecture.
    Mr Walker received the degree of Doctor of Laws from the Uni
versity of Glasgow.       He  was appointed president   of the Institution
of Civil Engineers on the death of Mr Telford in 1834.             He  was
a   fellow of the Royal Society of London ; and in 1824 he was
elected into the Royal Society of Edinburgh.            He had been for
some    time before his death in declining health,        but to a robust
constitution   he added an abundant flow of cheerfulness and spirit;
and even on the day before he died he was writing a report to the
 Admiralty on the subject of Alderney Harbour of Refuge.                He
 was suddenly seized      with a stroke of apoplexy, and expired on the
 8th October 1862, in his eighty-first year.        At his own request,
 his remains    were  interred in his family burial-place, at St John's
 Chapel, Edinburgh.
    Dr Thomas Stewart        Traill  was born on the 29th October 1781,

                     of Edinbunjh,       Session 1862-63.                  31
at   Kirkwall, in Orkney, of which place his father was minister.
 Throughout his life he retained a most affectionate interest in his
 native islands.      " He was,"    as we read    in a contemporary notice,
 "
    Ortadiensibus orcadiensior, and his face lighted up, and his hand
gave an   extra grip, when he met with a man whose young eyes had
seen   the Old Man of Hoy, and who had heard the roar of the Pent-
land   Firth from the south."
   He graduated       in medicine      in the University of Edinburgh in
1802, where      he had    been   the fellow-student of Lord Brougham,
Sir David Brewster, Principal             Lee, and other eminent     persons.
 He is believed to have settled in Liverpool in 1804, where he con
 stantly resided as a physician          in good practice    until 1832.   He
 was  highly esteemed, professionally and personally, in that great
 mercantile city, and formed intimate friendships with its leading
 men.     He promoted warmly the societies founded there for the
 diffusion of literature and science, especially the Royal Institution
 of Liverpool,     of which he was one of the founders and the first
 secretary.     He maintained      throughout    life an intimacy with Lord
 Brougham, having a common interest with him in many philan
 thropic objects. In 1832, he was appointed to the Chair of Medical
 Jurisprudence in this University, which he filled until his death
 thirty years later. He took great pleasure in lecturing. Chemistry,
 mineralogy, and meteorology, were his favourite sciences. In 1804,
 he delivered    a popular course on chemistry for a benevolent object
 in  Kirkwall.     This is said to have been the first course of the kind
 given    in Scotland.       He lectured     frequently in Liverpool;     and
 after he became a professor          in Edinburgh, he not only delivered
 his  own course of lectures, but also repeatedly that of Professor
 Jameson on natural history         ;   and once at least he lectured for a
 session   in the chemical class, during Dr Hope's decline.
     He was a diligent attender on this Society,          and for many years
  curator  of the library, with    a seat   in the Council.    He contributed
  a great   many papers to our Proceedings,          and some are printed in
  the  Transactions.*       They are not always of an important class,
  bnt are   of a kind very serviceable in promoting the interest of
    *  In volume   ix., " Account of a Mineral from Orkney," and " Electro
  magnetic Observations and Experiments."        Vol. xiv., " On a New Writing
  Ink." Vol. xv., "On Fossil Fishes found in the New Red Sandstone of

32                Proceedings       of the Royal      Society
meetings such as ours, and a taste for science generally.                  This,
indeed, was     Dr Traill's forte.      His tenacious memory storing up
the results of considerable        reading    and extensive      conversational
intercourse, supplied him with ready materials             for illustrating any
topic brought under his notice.          It is not surprising that, trusting
largely to memory, his accuracy is not in all cases perfectly to be
relied on. He was nominally editor of the eighth edition of the
Encyclopaedia     Britannica, and he certainly contributed to it some
forty articles  ; but his responsibility was,      I believe,   chiefly confined
to the earliest volumes, the greater part having been practically
edited by the able publisher,       Mr Adam Black.
    Latterly, owing to infirmity, Dr Traill ceased to attend the
meetings of this Society,        where he had, for a quarter of a century,
occupied a familiar place.         But his lectures he never discontinued,
and persevered with them until within twelve days of his death.
It was well known to his colleagues, that had he lived to complete
that course, which was his thirtieth, he would then have resigned
his chair.     He died    at  Edinburgh, on the 30th          July  last, in his
eighty-first year, being the fourth octogenarian on our list .
    Yet one more venerable colleague and useful member remains
to be noticed.
    Mr John Rdssell, writer to the Signet, and for eighteen years
treasurer    of the Society, was born 22d February 1780. He was
descended from three generations of men who had exercised in Edin
 burgh the same respectable calling.          By his mother's side, however,
 he  inherited of right    a taste  for literature  ;  for she  was daughter    of
 Principal Robertson,       an honourable     connection, which      Mr Russell
 always loved to recall.    In  point of fact,  Mr Russell retained through
 out an active professional career both the tastes and acquirements of
 a well-educated   man and a scholar.        He was intimate with many of
 Orkney," and on " Berg-meal, or Mineral Flour of Dpgersfors, in Swedish
 Lapland." In vol. xvi., " Memoir of Dr T. C. Hope."          In vol. xx., "On <i
                                                 "
 Peruvian Musical Instrument." In vol. xxi., On the Torbanohill Mineral."
 These titles give a good general idea of the varied subjects of Dr Traill 's
 communications.    His last contribution to the Society seems to have been that
 made on 15th February 1858,
                                " Description of the Sulphur Mine of Conil
                                                                               [in

those who, some      forty years ago, rendered the   literary society of Edin
burgh famous, with not a few of whom he was associated as one of
the founders     of the Edinburgh Academy, in which he took             a  life
long interest.      He became    a  Fellow of this Society in 1822, and its
Treasurer    in 1838.     He fulfilled the duties of the latter office in a
very exemplary manner, as         I  can testify from personal    knowledge.
He devoted to it not a little of his time, and brought the finances into
a better state than they had been        for a long time previously. For a
good    many years past his health prevented him from taking his place
at the   evening meetings ; but so long as he possibly could, he assidu
ously attended at council meetings, and in 1857, when he could no
longer do so, he resigned his office.        On that occasion he received
from the Society a piece of plate as a recognition            of his valuable
services.     His latter years were tranquilly spent at Southbank, near
Edinburgh,       a charming villa bequeathed         to him by his uncle,
General Robertson.        I  have very often visited him there, and found
him ever cheerful and occupied, generally with literary pursuits, in
which to the last he took a real pleasure.          At my very latest visit    I
found him refreshing his recollections          of the Latin Classics.      He
was a man      of wide sympathies, and had many friends of all parties.
He was a sincere Christian, and died at peace with all men.               This
happened on the 30th        January 1862, when he had almost completed
his eighty-second      year.   He is therefore the fifth octogenarian        on
our list, besides foreign members.
     Of the remaining names on our obituary list I do not feel called
on to say much.       But I must mention Dr Frra, a highly respectable
chemist, and a well-known lecturer in Edinburgh.              He  was at first
chemical assistant to     Dr Hope.     In  and after 1817, he lectured        at
the    Society of Arts, and in 1844 was appointed to the Chair of
Medicine in Aberdeen, having already been President, the year be
fore, of the Soyal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.             He died on
the 31st December       1861, aged nearly seventy years.
     Admiral Norwich Dupk, born in 1793, was descended from the
 first Earl of Fife.    His earlier years were spent in active service in
 various   parts  of the world.      Even before he      was  twenty he had
taken part    in several great naval battles.      About the time of enter-
    vol. v.                                                        e

34                  Proceedings   of the Royal     Society
ing this Society,      in  1823,   he was    well   known in     Edinburgh,
where he spent several winters,         though   he may be perhaps recol
lected by few persons now present.          He married in 1833     a  lady of
Bath, and he died in that city in the course of last summer.
     Mr Born Murdoch and Mr John Cockburn (brother of the late
Lord Cockburn) both frequently attended our meetings, but other
wise require no detailed notice here. The former was an active
agriculturist and country gentleman, and died in August last in his
seventieth year.
     Dr James Russell, whose death, at the       age  of sixty-one, occurred
only    on  the 21st November      last, was the eldest son of    Mr James
Russell, Professor of Clinical Surgery, and grandson of the Profes
sor of Natural Philosophy (also in this university), who was the pre
 decessor of Dr Robison.      Dr Russell lived a retired life, and although
 a physician,    had not for many years practised his profession.
     I have now, gentlemen,      with some prolixity I fear, attempted to
 go over the ground which I had in view when we started.            My great
 object has been to induce you to give a fair consideration to the
 claims    which the objects of this really national institution — the
 Royal Society — has upon you, its members. I have asked you to
 look back to your origin, — to the constellation of eminent men who
 assisted at your incorporation,— to the important labours which the
 Transactions     include, — to the social meetings which, with varying
 brilliancy and significance, have for eighty years connected genera
  tion with generation of the literary and scientific men of this me
 tropolis and university-seat with one another           ; and  I ask you to
  assist now, by your personal efforts, by your literary contributions
  if  possible, at least by your attendance       at our evening meetings,
  in adding    to the interest and value    of these meetings ;    I   ask you
  to encourage those who labour for the promotion of original re
  search, to maintain the credit of a society established for purposes
  the most disinterested     and humanizing, and by so doing        to, justify
  the position     which the Royal Society of Edinburgh assumes, of
  representing in some degree before the academies of Europe the
  intellect and original talent of our native country.

 1.   Ou the Representative        Relationships of the Fixed and Free
     Tunicata, regarded as two sub-classes of equivalent value ;
     with some general remarks on their morphology. By
     John Denis Macdonald, Esq., R.N., F.R.S., Surgeon H.M.S.
     " Icarus."        Communicated by Professor Maclagan.
    In this paper the author maintains the proposition,              that   the
class Tunicata may be conveniently divided into two sub-classes,
viz.,   the Fixed or Stationary,       and the Free or Locomotive,        of at
least nearly equal value in a zoological point of view, in opposition
to the opinion        commonly    entertained,   that the so-called    Pelagic
Tunicata compose          a group only commensurate      with the groups of
the Compound, the Social and the Simple, into which the Fixed
Tunicata have been divided by Milne-Edwards and others.
    After some general remarks on the morphology of the class
Tunicata, the author proposes the classification, of which the fol
lowing are the leading subdivisions, and under which he groups
and classifies the various genera of Tunicata.
                                   Tunicata.
                 Sub-class 1st. — Animals fixed or stationary.
    I. Branchial      membrane closely     adherent,   or more or less per
fectly     sac-like  ;   simply areolated or distinctly retiform,           the
meshes disposed in many transverse series without non-ciliated
supporting     bars.
    1.  Gremmas   springing directly from the parent, with       a temporary
       bond of union — Simple Tunicata.
    2. Gcmmae      springing separately from      a definite  " ascidiarium "
       (IIux.),   and      communicating    indirectly   through   a   central
       common vascular system — Social Tunicata.
    3. Gemmae      arising separately from the parent with or without
       vascular    intercommunication,       but always immersed in a
       common test or "ascidiarium"       — Compound Tunicata.

       Sul  class 2d. — Animals free, locomotive.  — Pelagic Tunicata.
    II.  Branchial membrane sac-like, with transverse slits in single
longitudinal series, strengthened by longitudinal non-ciliated rods,
apertures terminal or sub-terminal.
    III.   Respiring by    an  upper and a lower     gill-band, connected
with each other laterally, and with the walls of the atrium ; having
branchial slits, but no supporting longitudinal rods ; apertures
 terminal.
    IV.   Respiring by     a central   and inferior gill-band,    with free
 borders    and transverse    ciliated stripes, but without slits or rods    ;
 apertures terminal or sub-terminal.
     V. Pharynx ciliated below, without a distinct gill-band ; bran
 chial slits reduced to two ciliated openings on the sides of the
 rectum.
     The author concludes his paper with remarks on several of the
 genera, in reference to the position assigned to them in his classi
 fication,   and with some details as to the anatomy of Orthocala         —
 the Salpa pinnata of authors.
 2.   On the great Refractor at Elchies, and its powers in
     Sidereal Observation.           By Professor C. Fiazzi Smyth,
     Astronomer-Royal for Scotland.
     The telescope here referred to is the largest and best ever erected
 in Scotland, for exact sidereal observation ; and the author having
 paid a visit last September to its liberal and hospitable owner, J.
 W. Grant, Esq., of Elchies, Morayshire, had an opportunity of
 trying its powers on double stars, and describes the results of the
 trial in his paper.
     Out of   a list of twenty-nine double stars, there wero six      cases
 where one or more new small stars were discovered;            and the ob
  servations of position    and distance on the older members of each
 group were so trustworthy, as to add valuable        information towards
 elucidating both the proper motion of some optical double stars,
  and the orbital motion of several binary ones.            In addition to
 which, several unexpected results       were arrived at with reference to
 cosmical changes in the magnitudes         and colours of certain stars.

1.  Biographical Account of Professor Louis Albert Necker,
   of Geneva, Honorary Member of the Royal Society of
   Edinburgh.          By David James Forbes, D.C.L., F.R.S.,
   V.P.R.S. Ed., Principal of the United College of St Sal
   vador and St Leonard, in the University of St Andrews.
   Louis     AIbert Neckek,     who died at Portree, in Skye, on the 20th
November       1861, aged 76,      had been for many     years a Foreign
Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
   His relation    to the  Royal Society, and to Scotland generally,    was,
however, far different from what belongs to most honorary members.
As a youth, his studies had been pursued at the Edinburgh Uni
versity.      He had received almost his first introductions      to society
amongst the very best circles         which the Scottish    capital, in the
days   of perhaps its highest literary and scientific      celebrity, could
afford  ;  he visited the Highlands, and even the remoter Hebrides,
with an admiring enthusiasm          which few native tourists have sur
passed.      In later life  he returned   with renewed interest to revisit
the scenes where he spent      his youth.    He not unfrequently attended
the meetings      of the Royal Society, and occasionally contributed      to
   vol.   v.                                                       H

54                Proceedings of the Royal Society
its Transactions   ;  and, finally, having made Scotland      the country
of his adoption, and     passed   the last twenty-five   years of his   life
almost entirely on its soil, his remains were laid in the churchyard
of the remote village of Portree, which had long become his sole
residence.
   Under all these circumstances, a slight biography of Mr Necker
peculiarly merits a place in the Proceedings of the Royal Society.
I shall rather endeavour to convey an idea of what our learned and
amiable associate really was, derived from my acquaintance             with
him personally, and through his writings, than to enumerate all the
details of his life, which, as in the case of most literary men, was
far from eventful.
   Louis Albert Necker       was  bom at Geneva       on the   10th   April
1786.    His father, Jacques Necker,      was Professor   of Botany, and
also a councillor of state and syndic of Geneva.            This Jacques
Necker was nephew of the financier Necker under Louis X VI., and
cousin-german of Madame De Stael.           Louis Necker was therefore
one generation    farther removed from those eminent persons.           His
mother, Albertine de Saussure, daughter          of the illustrious Swiss
naturalist, was a person of unusual talent, and of the most amiable
disposition.    His attachment to her throughout her life       was  of the
tenderest and     most constant     kind.   She died in 1841.       She is
known to the public by her excellent work called " Education Pro
gressive," and also by a biographical notice of Madame de Stael.
Necker finished his school studies at Geneva in 1800, and entered
the Acade'mie, where he followed the various courses of the higher
studies for four years.      In July  1803, in company with his father,
he made his first journey into the Alps, commencing             with Cha-
mouni, and extending       it to Zermatt.    I recollect to have seen in
the visitors' book at Chamouni       Louis Necker's own record of this
visit, entered in a boyish hand.
   In   1806 Louis     Necker proceeded to Edinburgh (being then
twenty years of age), for the purpose of prosecuting his studies at
the University, and of improving his mind by foreign travel. This
was a practice by no means uncommon         amongst the educated Gene-
vese  of that date, and one which,    I am  glad to say, continues at the
present time.     Those who pursued medicine and the physical sci
ences have especially resorted to     Edinburgh.     The result has   been

which has been constantly experienced not lees by those of the one
country than of the other. Mutual hospitalities and many valued
 friendships have    been thence derived.
    Of such results Necker's was a signal instance.                 After  the
 age  of twenty, Scotland became to him a second fatherland.                As
 became the grandson of De Saussure, he was already conversant
 with mineralogy and geology        ;   and he could not in all Europe
have found a school better fitted to educe his talents             than  Edin
burgh presented at that period.          In  the University, indeed, under
the zealous Jameson, the doctrines           of Werner reigned supreme.
 Yet it    was  well for  a   young    geologist   of that day to      become
acquainted     with his teachings    ;  and in so far as they were over
strained    or erroneous, there was an ample          corrective  in the dis
tinguished school of Huttonians, who then discussed and eluci
dated the theory of their master, partly in the University, but
principally in the hall of the Royal Society, and by their writ
ings.     Necker was personally acquainted with Playfair, Sir James
Hall, Lord Webb Seymour, Hope, Allan, and others, who met
nearly every week at the period of Necker's stay in Edinburgh, to
discuss    in this Society   the theories of geology, and to listen and
reply to the less numerous, yet undaunted supporters of Werneri-
anism, headed by the persevering Jameson.               Already, during the
winter of 1806-7, Necker bad visited the interesting coast of Fife,
and the principal islands of the Forth         ; and under the guidance of
Sir James Hall himself had inspected the numerous and interest
ing geological sections which abound on its southern shore as far
as St Abb's Head.       At other times he travelled in company with
Patrick Neill and others of the Jamesonian school, and had an              op
portunity of judging impartially the opinions of either party. Of
course the discussions of the winter were to be farther pursued in
the field during summer       ; and Necker,      nothing loth to judge for
himself concerning the facts of which he had          become   accustomed to
hear such conflicting explanations,       undertook excursions not only in
the geologically interesting neighbourhood         of Edinburgh, hut to the
west   of Scotland, and even into the farthest Highlands, then but
little visited.    The origins of granite and trap        were  of course the
main objects of bis search, so far as geology was concerned          ; and, no
doubt by the advice principally of Playfair,         who used to call Arran
an epitome     of the world,  one of bis early excursions (in May 1807;

56                  Proceedings       of the Royal Society
was    to visit that island,     which he appears to have studied with
scrupulous care, having spent nine days in the northern and most
interesting part of the island. He was accompanied by a fellow-
student named Shute.           He there became        a convert to the    igneous
theory of granite, and seems to have been among the first to direct
attention    to the granite veins of Tor-nid-neon,             afterwards    more
carefully explored by Mr James Jardine.*
    On the 6th August 1807, Necker again left Edinburgh to visit
Staffa and the Western Highlands.              He travelled by Inverary and
Oban, and traversing       Mull, enjoyed at the small island of Ulva the
hospitality of Mr Macdonald            of Staffa, with whom he formed            a
close friendship,     and of whose kindness          I  have heard him speak
warmly even in his later years.            From Ulva he made two excur
sions to Staffa, to the geology and mineralogy of which he of course
devoted the utmost attention.            He next visited the Island of Coll,
where he observed traces of the action              of the Gulf-stream in the
transported    seeds   and other products of West Indian origin.               He
crossed to Tiree, with its ornamental marble             ; on leaving which he
was driven     back to Coll by stress       of weather, but finally reached
Eigg, ascended the Scuir, celebrated for its pitchstone, its fossil
wood, and for the cavern which was the scene of a well-known
historic massacre.       Thence he touched at Rum and Canna, care
fully visiting what was most interesting in each ; crossed to South
Uist, and finally to Skye, reaching Talisker on the 23d September.
The advanced       season   of the year compelled him soon to think of
returning southwards.          After a stay of a few days only, he left
Skye with vivid feelings of regret at having obtained only a glance
at its noble scenery and interesting mineralogy.              Little did he then
think that that island should one day            be as   familiar  to him as   his
native    Switzerland, and should, after more than half a century,
afford him a final resting-place!       He returned to Edinburgh by Inver
ness,   Elgin, and Blair- Athole, without, however, visiting Glen Tilt.
    These particulars have been chiefly gathered from a journal of
his Tour in Scotland, by Mr Necker, evidently nearly all written
at the time, but (with a procrastination               which became habitual
with him) not published until           1821  f (fourteen    years later), when

the interest of the details was considerably                      diminished.         Perhaps
partly from this            cause,    the circulation of the work was,              I believe,
not great, and in this country                 it is certainly much less known than
it deserves to          be.     It                       with great
                                      is written, for the most part,
animation, and conveys a lively impression of the literary society of
Edinburgh at that day, and of the state of society in the remoter
Highlands and Islands,      well among the higher as the lower
                                       as
classes. It includes many excellent descriptions of scenery, and
many accurate details of the mineralogy and geology of the places
he visited, written evidently in the manner of De Saussure, whose
writings          were naturally the object            of his life-long admiration.
Though           admitted      to the intimate        society of many amiable and
accomplished            families, he exercised a wise discretion                in giving no
personal         details,    and he confined his public references to scientific
and literary men, whose attainments                    and opinions were open to the
remark of every one.                  The caution with which         he holds the balance
between  Huttonian and Wernerian doctrines is almost amusing.
But though the decidedly Wernerian views of his illustrious grand
father        tended,       perhaps,    more than anything else to                 secure his
favourable          mention      of Werner's classification           of Rocks, and his
adoption of his nomenclature, the Huttonian bias of his mind is
everywhere visible ; and he does not hesitate to declare, that what
ever may be the worth of Hutton's Theory of the Earth in its most
wide and speculative sense, yet that the facts of geology have been
more correctly and impartially stated by his followers than by their
opponents.*
     These        volumes      also show a general              acquaintance      with other
branches of science besides geology,                    and with literature          and art,
highly characteristic                of the man.      Ornithology, in particular,          was
then and afterwards a favourite study.  They contain a great deal
on matters connected with the social condition of the country, and
its progress in civilisation, and on various                       questions of the day,

Qeneva, for unmarried            men to assume        their mother's surname after their
own      ;   after marriage, their wife's.      Hence, M. Necker
                                                             sometimes spoken of

as   if  his family name were De Saussure.
     *   Mr Cumming Bruce, M.P., recollects that at this period, Necker " used to
expresshis regret that the party spirit then at its height between the Wer-
ncrians and  Huttonians did not allow either to give due weight to facts
which might  have  made them more tolerant of each other."

 which now, of course, have lost much of their interest, but which
 mark a very intelligent and acquisitive           mind.     In  particular,  it is
 amusing to notice how his Caledonian             enthusiasm      every now and
 then breaks forth in defence of Scotsmen and their country in
 opposition to what he considered to be unjust English                prejudices.
 He repudiates the idea that Scotland's prosperity was in any mate
 rial degree due to the Union with England ; he despises the sneers
of Dr Johnson         ; and he believes all that reasonably could be be
 lieved of the genuineness         of Ossian's Poems,     a portion     of which,
moreover, he heard recited by a native of Tiree.
     It  is easy to believe that a young Swiss, highly intelligent, and
animated by sentiments           so agreeable to Scotchmen,         was warmly
 welcomed       into the best circles      of Edinburgh. Among the sur
vivors of those who were then intimate with him,                I  have received
a    few   slight reminiscences from two, — Mr Charles L. Cumming
Bruce,      M.P., and Mr James Mackenzie.* In the families of these
two gentlemen he was ever welcome             ; and his gaiety, intelligence,
gentleness, and love of female society, made him a great favourite.
Indeed, the domestic pleasures of that early visit made an impres
sion on his mind          which   was never eclipsed, — which yet possibly
 tended to throw a shade of gloom over his more advanced years,
when, still solitary in the world, the magnetic             influence    of early
scenes and       friendships drew him once and again back to his much-
loved Scotland.         It was at the house of " the Man of Feeling''
                      " he
especially, that            met, and was most intimate with, all that was
best and most        distinguished in the then charming society of Edin
burgh, which consisted, among others, of Dugald Stewart, Playfair,
 Walter Scott, Jeffrey, Dr Hope, and Lord Webb Seymour, with
all of whom his happy temper and naive cheerfulness made him a
great favourite.        When they took their departure,      he used to remain
discussing their various characters          with the accomplished ladies of
the     family." f Mr James Mackenzie kindly informs me that
Necker's chief college companion was an intelligent English medi
cal student named Smith, with whom he lodged at first in St James's
Square.       Previously (no doubt in the winter 1806-7) he lived in
the College, in the house of Wilson the janitor.

seem     all to have been performed either in the winter of 1806-7, or
in the    following summer and autumn.                  There is no doubt that he
passed the succeeding winter in Edinburgh, but then, for a time, we
lose trace of him.            It appears from a passage in his book (vol. ii.
p. 67),    that he visited Devonshire            and Cornwall in 1809 with geo
logical objects.        I cannot       be sure whether or not he had previously
returned      to Geneva.         I    understand     that his home journey took
place through       Holland, and was not free from embarrassment, owing
to the    war.     In 1808 he was elected a member of the SocUte de
Physique      et d'Histoire Naturelle         de Geneve,      which   seems     rather to
indicate      that he returned home in that year.                    In 1810 he was
appointed, under the French rigime, joint Professor of Mineralogy
and   Geology       at Geneva      ;   and became Honorary Professor               (under
the Swiss Government)             in   1817.    In   both these capacities         he de
livered various courses         of lectures,   as   well on geology    as mineralogy        ;
and his geological          excursions       with his students        are   still advan
tageously      recollected.
    In   1813     he visited     Auvergne,       the Vivarais, and the South             of
 France, for geological purposes, and at the same time the Pyrenees,
and probably the coasts          of Genoa.*        Mr Cumming Brace's notes give
ns a   glimpse of Necker about this period under a different                       aspect.
 "My     Dext salient     recollection      of him," writes Mr C. Bruce, "pre
                            '
 sents him to me as            Minister of Police' on my arrival at Geneva

 The republic        had just effected its restoration, and repudiated                  its
 annexation      to France.        I   was stopped at the gates to exhibit my
 passport, wh«n, to my         infinite delight, my friend [Necker] presented
 himself     in uniform,t and you may imagine that my baggage was
 passed   with scant investigation.           He consigned it to two attendants,
 with orders to carry        it to Cologny,       to which (his father's charming
 villa) he insisted on          my accompanying him ; and there, in the
enjoyment of the kindest hospitality, rendered more and more agree

Conseil   of his Canton, and in 1818 was a representative             of Geneva at the
Swiss Diet.

beautiful lake. In those days we used to call him Foucht, in virtue
of his office      as Minister of Police.            I owed   to him at that time ray
introduction to the society of Coppet, and the kind and sustained
friendship of Madame de Stael. There, with Schlegel, Sismondi,

her daughter, Louis and                I  formed two of the dramatis persona: in

Byron."*
    I  find that in 1820 he made an excursion                   to Italy.   Indeed,    he
not improbably          had passed the previous           winter there, though      I  do
not know the occasion.                At all events he visited Mount Vesuvius
in April     ;   and he then made interesting observations                on the dykes
or injected lavas of Monte Somma, his account of which                           f   still
remains classical, and connects itself with his studies of Huttonian
geology in Scotland.
    In   1821 he at last brought out his work on Scotland, and having
thus relieved himself of              a task    of which he had no doubt long felt
the weight, he set himself seriously to what he no doubt considered
the main business of his life — the study of the geology of the Alps,
in continuation and verification of the labours of his grandfather,
De Saussure, whose academic chair he had for some years occupied.}
He had previously travelled in Switzerland from time to time with
geological objects in view, but from and after 1821 (as he himself
tells us) he made regularly two annual excursions, one in the early §
part of summer in the lower and outlying parts of the chain, and
another      towards autumn             in the higher Alps. He justly remarks
that the importance of the study of the inferior and external parts
of the range was at that time not fully appreciated, and still less,
perhaps, the excessive fatigue, heat, and even peril, attending the
investigation, step by step, of these rugged calcareous mountains,
which fully equal in height, even when allowance is made for their
elevated bases,         the highest         mountains     of Britain.     In all   these
cases he examined            on foot, and step by step, the range of country

within which his special journey             was  confined, making elaborate
notes and drawings         on the spot, which he inked       in at leisure, thus
accumulating       a mass     of authentic    and valuable    details, of which
unfortunately but a very small part ever saw the light.*                    The
environs of Geneva and the important and intricate country between
its lake and the       bases    of Mont Blanc, formed the most frequent
scene of his geological         labours.    In  1826 he made a special study
of the Valley of Valorsine (near Chamouni),                with its interesting
granite veins and pudding-stones.             It may be conceived with what
interest he compared the former traces of the vast upheaving forces
which raised the Alps, with those which he had sedulously ex
amined nearly twenty years before in the Isle of Arran.
    But his researches were far from confined to his own district of
Switzerland and Savoy.             He had previously visited the Eastern
Alps, including the environs of Trieste, and a great extent of
country then almost unknown            to geologists, extending southwards
nearly to Dalmatia, and northwards to Vienna.                   Family affairs
in part, I believe, directed his course to Trieste, and the visit was
repeated for some consecutive            years.   To connect his studies in
the East with those in the Western Alps, he undertook in 1828                  a
special journey, which         lasted from May to September,          of part of
which he published          a brief account (Etudes Geohgiques, Preface,
and Bibl. Univ., Oct. 1829).            This last is a paper on the inter
esting    hypersthenic      syenite  of the Valteline.      He started by    the
Tarentaise,     Little St Bernard, and Val d'Aoste, by Val Sesia, along
the whole series of the Italian          lakes to the Vicentin, and thence
to Belluno a Pieve di Cadore, from whence he reached Trieste by
the Valley of the Tagliamento.            He thence traversed Carniola      and
Carinthia, entering        the Tyrol near Fassa, and pursuing his route
by the Stelvio and Valteline, until he regained his former track at
Oomo.      In 1829, or subsequently, he returned once again with
admirable perseverance to the Alps of Carniola, and those of Istria
   * As an example,    I may mention that soon after M. Favre's interesting
paper   had  appeared in 1848, on the Geology of Chamouni, in which he
announces the interesting fact that the summit of the Aiguille Rouge is
composed    of lias in horizontal strata, being at Portree, I mentioned the fact
to M. NecVer, who thereupon speedily turned up in his old Alpine notes a
section of the Aiguille Rouge clearly expressing the same fact.
    VOL. V.                                                             I

 fossiliferous deposits of the Tarentaise, to which, about that time,
M. die de Beaumont had called fresh attention.
    I cannot     but pause to remark, that had        M. Necker resolutely      set
himself to publish at thai time his most elaborate and persevering
researches on countries even yet so little known to geologists as the
Southern and Eastern Alps, he would have obtained a distinguished
 rank amongst the foremost field-geologists            of his day. There is no
doubt but that almost to the close of his life he was looking forward
 to still effecting the publication of what he knew had been too long
 delayed, yet of which he could not but be aware of the value.
    We have now reached the year 1829, when Necker was forty-
 three years of age, and from this period we may probably trace the
commencement of the second and far less happy stage of his life.
 As one of his attached countrymen observes, in a letter to me, the
 two phases were so unlike, that they might seem to have belonged
to different        individuals;    the first period  marked     by the greatest
bodily and mental activity, exuberant spirits, and relish for society;
the second by comparative             indolence, too often by moody reserve,
and a painful tendency to misconstrue the kindest intentions of his
warmest friends.           One of the latter informs      me that when he saw
him as late as 1824, he was, to use a homely phrase,                 "blithe  as a
bee  ;" and     I    have no doubt that it was about 1829 that his health
began to fail, — partly, one may believe, in consequence of the effects
upon a nervous, though wiry constitution, of the very prolonged               and
laborious pedestrian journeys which he had previously made through
countries      often     inhospitable    and  sometimes     insalubrious.    One
evidence of the change in his health, was his seeking                  variety of
scene,     and a less rigorous     winter climate than that of Geneva, by
returning once more to his well-remembered               Scotland.
    My' acquaintance with M. Necker commenced at Edinburgh in
November or December 1831. The exact date is recalled to me by
having first heard from him (then just arrived from London) of
the brilliant discoveries which Mr Faraday had communicated
to the      Royal Society,     on  the derivation    of electric currents from
permanent       magnets.       I  can even now recall the spot on which M.
Necker first         made   me   acquainted    with  this grand result.      The
privilege of making his acquaintance was to me at the time a great

one.     His favourite sciences were those which then occupied most of
 my own attention, — geology, meteorology, and general and terrestrial
 physics.     He was perfectly at home in the Alps, which I had already
visited, and     to which    I was about to return.     He  was as communi
cative   as   I  was   desirous to learn   ;  and having, at that particular
period, my time very much at my own disposal, as he also had, we
found many congenial subjects of discourse of which we never tired,
and innumerable objects for geological            rambles in the neighbour
hood   of Edinburgh, with which, of course,        I was familiar, and which
were intimately associated in his mind with the precious lessons
which he had drawn from the lips of Playfair and of Hall.                  In
addition to this, many of his early friends were also my own. It
may therefore be believed that, with his naturally amiable and
communicative disposition, we were not long in becoming fast
friends.     I   may    say confidently    that   with few persons have      I
spent   more delightful hours at any period of my life, or been           re
warded by a larger amount of instruction, conveyed with a simplicity
and grace which were peculiarly his own.             M. Necker's appearance
at this time was remarkably           prepossessing.    He  was  rather short
than otherwise; well proportioned and active; his complexion was
dark but ruddy; his eyes, of a fine blue, beamed with intelligence;
his nose was aquiline, and the upper and lower parts of the face
slightly    retreating; the mouth firm but sweet; his gait rapid,
nervous, and earnest.          He spoke English with the utmost fluency,
but with a foreign accent far from disagreeable.              He had a keen
sense   of humour (as may         bo gathered   from  Mr Cumming Bruce's
early recollections),      which   never forsook him, and he possessed       a
stock of natural gaiety which         flavoured his conversation even long
after he was subject to those fits of melancholy from which, in later
life, he suffered     so severely.
    He left Edinburgh for London 'in February 1832, where I also
 passed some time in his society.            Later in the same year we met
at Geneva, where        I  experienced   his hospitality, and had the good
fortune to be introduced to his excellent mother.          The same autumn
 he  invited    me   to  join him in   a  tour through part of Switzerland,
including the Oberland and Valais. This pleasant tour lasted for
a fortnight, and showed the resources of my friend in many new
lights.    From the commencement             of 1832 until hio 'loath, almost

  64                   Proceedings      of  the  Royal Society
  thirty years later,       we  maintained     a correspondence     which, though
  often recurring at long intervals, was          not discontinued.        By the aid
  of these letters        I can trace some particulars         of his migrations,
   which might otherwise have escaped me.
      In  1833 and 1834 he appears to have been much engaged in the
  preparation of a treatise on Mineralogy, which had for long occupied
  his thoughts.        He spent the winter of 1834-5 in Paris, carrying it
  through the press.         This was M. Necker's most considerable and
  most systematic work.           It  shows to advantage the combination            of
  scientific knowledge which he possessed,           — which,   as  I have    already
*
  intimated,    extended over a wide range of subjects, including not
  only the Natural History Sciences, but Physics and Chemistry.
  Such    a combination        is eminently required        by the philosophical
  mineralogist.        His science is unfortunately at present cultivated
  by few, and profoundly studied by hardly any.                Had this not been
  so, Necker's     fame would have been          more widely spread than it is.
  In   a very    remarkable      paper, first   published    in Jameson's Edin
  burgh Philosophical Journal            for 1832,   he treated of " Mineralogy
  as a Branch     of Natural History."        He showed that      a well character
  ized mineral       is   to be regarded as an individual, and that such
  individuals     are to be grouped        under species, genera,      orders, and
  classes,   as in the classification       of the organic creation, by having
  a  philosophical      regard to  the whole of the characters and properties
  which     belong to the individuals of each species,           in the same      way
  as was done by        Cuvier for animals, and by Decandolle             for plants.
  His aim was to conciliate         as far as may be the hitherto         conflicting
  systems of classification, — that by Chemical properties alone, and
  that from External characters alone.              His doctrine was (in brief)
  that those chemical characters are most to be regarded which visibly
   and    palpably      affect the   external    features of the mineral         indi
   vidual  ;  that the indications      of ultimate chemical analysis         are not,
   correctly speaking,       mineralogical     characteristics  at all  ;   and that,
   where chemical and external           indications  are in apparent contradic
   tion (which is rare), the latter are to be preferred.
      Necker applied his principles, which he had derived from a large
   and wide study of Natural History in its most general sense, with
   very great ingenuity to the distinction and classification of minerals.
   His system is detailed         at great length, and with        much clearness

and precision, in his Regne Mineral, rameni aux Methodes d'Histoire
NatureUe (Paris, 1835, 2 vols.), to which            I  have already referred.
It  is evidently a work conducted with the most patient and consci
entious lahour.       The elaborate tabular views illustrating the system
of classification    by the totality of the properties on which it is
founded, have probably never been exceeded in clearness of detail.
   I  do not feel entitled to give an opinion as to the success with
which Necker applied his principles to the reform of mineralogical
classification.     But it is admitted by competent judges that he laid
down those principles with great success, and in a highly philosophic
manner.       Dr Whewell in his Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences,
has   devoted    almost a whole       chapter*  to an analysis        of Necker's
work, to which he gives high commendation.                    Professor     W. H.
Miller, of Cambridge, probably           our highest     English authority on
mineralogy, has expressed to me his approbation both of Necker's
                                                                            "
paper in the Philosophical Journal, and of his larger work.                   They
indicate," he says, "on the part of the author, a most philosophic
mind.      His criticisms    on preceding classifications     are very just."
   I  think that the labour — both mental and mechanical — of writing
find  editing this elaborate treatise, so full of minute details, and of
discussions (at least in the introduction) of almost metaphysical
subtlety, was perhaps greater than the author's then enfeebled health
could   well support. Necker was never afterwards quite the same
 man   as before.     His nervousness increased painfully, accompanied
 by fits  of absence, and excessive love of seclusion.             He considered,
 probably with justice, that the rigorous winters            of Geneva aggra
 vated   his sufferings, and returning to Scotland, he passed the winter
 of 1836- 7 in Edinburgh.          In the summer of 1837 he returned to
 Switzerland, and made probably his last journey of any length in
 the Alps.      He crossed the Col of Mont Cervin, studying carefully
 the geology of that wonderful country, and also the southern portion
 of the    mountains      separating    Grindelwald from the Valais.              In
 1838    we find him       again    in Edinburgh, preparing to pass the
 winter, which he did at Portobello, near Edinburgh, and close to
 the seaside, where he hired a small house, and lived              in almost com
 plete seclusion.      I  visited  him occasionally      ; but any society was
 oppressive to him.         His windows looked right out upon the               sea,

and be pleased himself by thinking               that nothing but the ocean
separated him in a right line from Norway.                  Leaving Portobello
in May 1839, he spent part of three months in his old favourite
resort, the   Isle of Arran.        Here he occupied himself with much
diligence and zeal in surveying accurately the granitic and trappean
formations of the island.         The results were presented         to the  Royal
Society of Edinburgh, in         April   1840,  in an elaborate paper, which
embraces    a minute tabular description of no less than 149 individual
trap dykes in the north-eastern            part of the island      alone, besides
giving indications of many more. It was an occupation well suited
to M. Necker's state of health, affording constant, yet moderate
occupation of mind, and attraction out of doors, with the advan
tages of   a  temperate climate, and removal from any interruption,
or anxiety.        The wonderful        patience    and  conscientious      ability
with which     this labour was executed is worthy of all commenda
tion  ; and the really astonishing uature of the phenomena which
it chronicles    with so much minuteness, exempts it from the sus
picion of being a useless or puerile employment.               So close a survey
introduced M. Necker to many singular mineralogical                and geological
peculiarities   previously     overlooked   ;  and having myself since gone
over much of the ground with his memoir in my hand,                  I can testify
to its wonderful fidelity.       It  is impossible to foresee how important
this catalogue of dykes may one day prove to the future dynamical
geologist.*
    We have an interesting chronicle of Necker's               life at this time,
in  a series  of letters   to his mother, which were printed            soon  after
in   the Bibliothique      Universelh     de GenHve.f      They commence at
Portobello in February         1839, and they      unfortunately terminate in
September.       These letters, now buried in a large periodical work,
are   charming in themselves, and give             a delightful picture of the
writer's capacity for intellectual enjoyment.             He always presented
to his mother the gayer side of his impressions.              The little traits of
   * In  this paper (Trans. Roy. Soc. Ed., vol. xiv.), Necker refers with much

Jameson had already noted syenite near this locality.       I am not sure whether

what he saw interesting in botany,                   ornithology, mineralogy,           or
upon other scientific        topics, which he evidently felt sure would                 be
neither unintelligible         nor uninteresting to his correspondent.                 In
                                                                "  Je
quitting Arran, he adds the significant remark,                         regrette Arran,
ou   je me snis fait un bien prodigieux."                    The later part of the
season he spent       in the Orkney and Shetland Islands, interesting to
him,    as  well from the picture of primitive manners which they
present, as    from their remarkable geology.                This part of his tour is
detailed in his letters to Madame Necker                 ;  and there is a letter to
M. Moricand of Geneva               on the geology      of the Island of Unst, in
a   subsequent      number of the Bibliotheque              Universelle.       From the
Shetlands      he proceeded to Skye,            where he passed           the winter of
1839-40.        Here he found          so much      to interest     him geologically,
and also    found the damp but m:lcl climate to suit him                    so well, that
he was    gradually led to adopt Portree as b's permanent abode.
    During his residence in Skye, in the winter of 1 839-40, he                      was,
I    believe,   actively engaged in preparing                for the press the first
volume of bis Etudes Geologiques               dans les Alpes, of which no other
ever appeared.*         He spent the summer of               1840 at Geneva, where
the work was no doubt chiefly              written.    In the autumn he quitted
Geneva, with the deliberate purpose of making Portree his future
 residence.      He   passed    the winter in Paris, seeing his work through
 the press.      I find, from a letter to myself, dated at Edinburgh                    in
 April 1841, that Necker was then returning to Skye, having com
 pleted the    printing of his book, which bears date of 1841.
     The Eliules     Geologiques      form the third of Necker's               separately
 published writings.          They     were   probably expected by the author
 to be, when completed, his            best memorial, and the chief contribu
 tion to science     of  a  lifetime devoted      to its pursuit.         But the work
 as  it stands goes but       a  liltle way to realise those reasonable hopes.
 It   is but a fragment,         aud a fragment         of which the merits           and
 defects    are   equally characteristic.         We find evidence of patient,
 clear-sighted      investigation       into   natural     operations      which    would
 have escaped      a less  diligent observer, and whose significance                a less

  confined,    for the most part, to the superficial            formations,   and to
  the basin of the Lake of Geneva.             But the author's turn for dis
  cursive illustration of his subject          ever tempts        him to introduce
 curious, and sometimes         important facts, recorded by him in other
 countries, and in the older rock formations.                   The work, in fact,
 oscillates    between a memoir       on     local  geology       and a systematic
 treatise  ;  and it does not exactly fulfil the purpose of either.              The
 innumerable       references which it contains         to forthcoming       parts of
 the intended work give us good room to regret that Necker had
 not more strictly followed        the course pursued by his grandfather,
 De Saussure, by publishing his geological observations in the order
in which they were made, and interspersing them with those con
tributions to the other parts of physical geography, and those
 animated descriptions of scenery, in which be, as well as his
illustrious relative, peculiarly excelled.                  '
     Even in its present fragmentary form there is much to interest
the geologist in the isolated volume of studies which M. Necker has
 left.   The followers of Sir Charles          Lyell will find in it       a fund of
 admirable observations on the effect of           causes     still in action  ; and
 although the doctrines of glacial          operation     have made       great pro
 gress since 1841      ; and although      Necker     was    systematically disin
 clined    to   side with    those who      attributed     to the formerly       vast
 extension of glaciers conspicuous          effects both in and out of Swit
 zerland, his information       on the distribution of erratics in the basin
of the Lake of Geneva is very interesting and suggestive, and
many of the facts and difficulties which he propounds are worthy
of great consideration.*
     As the Etudes sur       les Alpes was the last, not           only of Necker's
larger    and separate, but even        (I    believe) of his more occasional
printed     contributions    to science,   I   may as well advert here to one
or two of the latter — his detached memoirs — which                     I  have not
already had occasion to mention.              There   are several on subjects      of
pure mineralogy,        perhaps of no great intrinsic importance.             There
is a paper in the Transactions        of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
    * I have elsewhere pointed out (Edin. Review, April, 1842) some errors
into which M. Necker fell in treating of the mechanism of glaciers, a subjoct
to which ho appears to have given but little attention.

a pleasing and somewhat elaborate              paper in the second volume of
the Genevese Memoirs on the native                  birds of the district.*         To
these    I   shall merely make this general reference.               But   I wish    to
mention three occasional papers, somewhat original in their nature,
and which are characteristic            of the pleasure which Necker took in
cultivating subjects connected with Physical Geography and Natural
Philosophy, in an enlarged acceptation, just such as M. Saussure
would have relished.
    The first of these was an attempt to connect in a general way
the great lines of geological stratification over the globe, with the
lines    of equal magnetic intensity,            as   traced by Hanstuen          and
General Sabine.          This was as early       as 1830,     f and it is only fair
to state,    that the knowledge either of the one or of the other class
of phenomena was then, at all events, too limited to justify any
confident deductions on the subject.             The comparison of these lines
of direction was not, however, made without considerable                    research,
and the      growing interest of the inquiry, and perhaps the increasing
probability of its having some physical foundation, induces me to
recall attention to Necker's memoir.                The recent speculations of
Dr Lloyd tend in the same direction, and                I  think also the observa
tions of      MM. Schlagintweit.          In Necker's      later writings, such as
the preface       to his Etudes, and in his letters to Mad. Necker, we
find that       he continued        to  give   weight to the        theory     of  the
connection of magnetic with geological phenomena.
    The next of these papers is contained in a letter addressed to Sir
 David Brewster, printed in the " Philosophical Magazine" for 1832.
 It  describes a very beautiful optical          phenomenon        observed by the
 author     iu the Alps, when the direct rays of the sun are concealed
by a line of forest fringing some rising ground between the spec
 tator and the sun.            The outlines     of the      trees, and even their
 entire stems, are then seen to shine with a white light of dazzling
 brilliancy, resembling        frosted silver.    The effect is not peculiar to

                                                        printed separately. Necker's
 kinsman, II. II. de Saussure, a very competent judge, styles it " charmante
 production devenue trcs rare, trop peu connuo a l'étranger, et qui meritorait

 any season of the year, or to any hour of the day.                       It   is no doubt
 due to the diffraction          or inflection of light acting under rather
 unusual circumstances,           and is the most notable                example of      the
 kind to    be seen       by the naked eye, without any artificial arrange
 ment.      I    well    recollect M. Necker showing me this beautiful
 appearance in the course of our tour                of 1832, and          I   have often
 observed       it since.      The remarkable       circumstance          is, so far    as    I
 recollect, the absence of prismatic colours, which might,                       however,
 be anticipated         from the infinite variety of dimension            of the objects
 diffracting the light.
      The third of                          M. Necker, having for
                        these occasional memoirs by
                    "
its subject certain   diverging rays which arc seen long after sun
set," appeared in the Annales de Chimie et de Physique for Febru
ary and March 1839.              It   was communicated,      I believe,
                                                        by Arago's
request. This paper excited little notice at the time, and  is now
perhaps nearly forgotten. Yet, though somewhat diffuse in com
position,   it contains observations and speculations worthy of record.
It    contains ample and specific descriptions of the second coloration
of Mont Blanc, and the exact intervals                after sunset at Geneva of
the various        appearances of illumination            presented by the Alps,
which have been more vaguely described by several writers.                             But
the more interesting and original part of the paper refers to the
production of divergent beams streaking the calm western sky, at
a period about 45 minutes after the sun's disappearance.  These,
no doubt, are most usually caused by detached clouds intercepting
the sunlight, and throwing their dusky shadows athwart the vapor
ous sky.        When such is the         cause,   M. Necker remarked that              bad
weather     usually followed          within    a short   period.*         But he      also
observed that some of these crepuscular phenomena had a more fixed
character, and did not indicate a change of weather                  ;   moreover, that
they recurred (he thought) as often as the sun set in the same
position, — that         is,
                   every spring and autumn, especially on certain
days of February and October, at Geneva.
     Hence he began to entertain               the idea that the dark rays were
shadows of distant mountains              lying westward from the              spectator,

on   the   horizon     of which      the sun was       situated   when    the rays
appeared.      In    the special case mentioned, he believed the Monte
Dome, near Clermont,           in France,     to originate those rays, and he
obtained    information      from various quarters tending to confirm           his
idea.    From having very often conversed with M. Necker on the
                   "
subject of his Rayons crepusculaires,"               I  know that for a number
of years   he gave      this curious inquiry his close attention         ;  and he
believed,   I  think, that from Edinburgh he could               see the   gigantic
shadows of the hills of Arran and Jura.
   M. Necker      was an honorary member          of the Wernerian Society of
Edinburgh, and of the Geological Society of London. In the Pro
ceedings of the latter (vol. i. p. 392, Feb. 1832) is a short abstract
of  a paper by him, on the Geological           Position of Metalliferous De
posits.
   Returning now to the history of M. Necker's later years, I may
abridge my record of them within a brief compass. We have seen
that he returned         from    Paris (where he had been printing his
" Etudes     sur les Alpes,") in April 1841, through Edinburgh, to
Portree, in Skye. He was there met by the grievous tidings of the
death of the mother to whom he had been              so deeply attached.       This
event occurred at Mornex, near Geneva,                 on  the 13th    April, pre
cisely two days before he quitted            Edinburgh.       It must have been
sudden    and unexpected,         or we may be sure that Necker would
not have moved northwards               had he perceived        her health    to be
failing.    It  is easy to conceive, though we have no record of its
details,   the   shock     which     thus   fell upon the amiable recluse.
Madame Necker was not only the dearest tie which still linked
him to his natural home, but in losing her he lost the bene
ficial outlet     to his sympathies          which     he   had   ever  found    in
the sustained       and intimate correspondence            which he held with
her, and      of which the printed specimens give us so pleasing
an impression.          From this time he never again revisited his
 native country,       and   his habits became more and more recluse.
 For some years after his great loss he refused to see almost
every one who, with the kindest intentions, sought to interrupt his
solitude, and he suspended nearly all correspondence.                 He rambled
occasionally    over different      parts of the Island of Skye, especially

72                Proceedings oj the Royal Society
amongst    the Cuchullin     Hills, and in the environs of Portree aD<l
the Storr.    But gradually he ceased to absent himself even for a
night from home, and confined his excursions within the distance
which his pedestrian powers allowed.           Once in two or three years,
as other engagements        permitted,   I visited Skye about this period,
for the purpose of ascertaining his condition, and of offering such
sympathy    as he was   willing to receive. My friendly overtures were
rarely if ever repulsed ; aud though it was painful to witness the
isolation and depression of        a person so   cultivated and so amiable,
there were always intervals in which his old spirits and old inte
rests awoke out of the partial torpor            induced     by his enfeebled
 health  and monotonous        life.  Scarcely a day passed during any
 one of my visits in which we did not walk together to some of the
charming localities near Portree, and discuss with renewed interest
the scientific problems which his intelligence and              quick observa
 tion were ever unfolding, whether from the noblest natural object,
or the most trivial daily occurrence, in his neighbourhood.              It was
evidently agreeable to him, even in his sadder moments, to use              ami
listen to his native language, to recall the scenery of his glorious
Alps, the achievements and writings of his eminent grandfather,
the memory of his accomplished mother, and the cherished reminis
cences of his early     life in Edinburgh.           Nothing was more sur
prising than to find how few passing events of either public or
domestic interest escaped him in his apparent isolation, from which
even correspondence      was at times almost banished.          At this period,
however, he read the newspapers           with great perseverance, and       he
seemed never to forget anything that he once read, or to fail                in
connecting it with what he had previously known.                  I used to be
amazed to find that he occasionally knew more of what was hap
pening in Edinburgh        than    I myself did    ;  and he tracked with an
unfailing instinct the changes which time rapidly produced in the
wide connections of his early Scottish friends, many of whom very
erroneously    believed   that he had        quite    forgotten   them.    His
periodical   reading  at this time embraced          the  Journal des Debate,
the Caledonian Mercury, and the John O'Groat Journal (a Caith
ness   paper); and from this singular library he managed to ex
tract a wonderful amount of current information, not only public
and domestic, but also concerning physical events                and changes,

and     literary   intelligence. Of modern books he read very few,
Lilt probably occupied his leisure in reviewing the records of his
geological tours, and, perhaps, in extending them for the purpose
of future     publication.     He  was a very assiduous observer    of Meteor
ological    changes,     of which he kept     a constant record,  and by the
aid of his    barometer, and his great knowledge of atmospheric effects,
his   cautions became of the most practical value to the fishing popu
lation    of Portree, by whom, as indeed by all the islanders,           he was
regarded      with much respect and interest, to which the peculiarity
of his manner of life, and his extreme shyness towards persons in
his own rank of life, no doubt contributed.                 The prediction of
storms     was with him for many years a matter of systematic study,
and his       warnings    were at least as much        regarded by the Skye
sailors    as any    which Admiral Fitzroy could now furnish.           Indeed,
one use      which he made of his newspaper studies was to trace, by
means       of the Shipping Intelligence, the progress of gales not only
over     Britain but to the most distant parts of the Atlantic, and he
 has often     discussed with me the results of these interesting,       and far
 from easy      investigations.     In   other respects also he took   a  sincere
 interest in the welfare       of his poorer neighbours.     His kindness was
 unpretending, and the extent of his liberality will never be known.
 It is little to say that it was exercised occasionally in ways pecu
 liarly of    his own devising, and that he was sometimes the dupe of
  designing or unworthy petitioners.            But in a country, a portion of
  whose    population     may be said to be ever on the verge of destitution,
  the presence      of so generous a    friend was  a public benefit.
      From 1851 the state       of my own health      made renewed     journeys
  to Skye    impossible, and through a most unfortunate        accident (which
  I  need   not explain) our correspondence was for some           years inter
  rupted.      Before this, however, the intense gloom supervening upon
  his mother's death had become,           in some   measure, dissipated.     He
  no longer     rejected the visits of his countrymen,      or eschewed corre
  spondence      as he had once done.        The death of his only brother in
   1849 affected     him considerably, but led him to welcome the younger
   relatives,   who now almost every summer gladdened              his solitary
  chamber.       It  is cheering to know that the later years of so good        a
   man were     blessed with    a revival of domestic interests, from which
   an
       invincible    melancholy,    foreign   alike to his original disposition

 74                 Proceedings     of the Royal Society
 and his principles, had for a time debarred him.            In the only letter
 from him of at all recent date which          I  possess, — it was written in
 1859, and was evidently the result          of considerable     physical exer
 tion, — there is pleasing evidence that neither advancing               age, nor
 expatriation, nor twenty years of solitude and of struggle with con
 stitutional depression, had quenched his sympathy with his friends,
 or his interest    in the cause of science.          In it I  find  a  touching
 enumeration     of the losses which he had suffered in the rapidly
 narrowing circle of his Genevese contemporaries and relatives ; —
 I  find also expressions of lively sympathy with the younger gene
 ration,   and their family connections;       — ample proofs that during
years of silence and seeming forgetfulness,          both his earlier and his
later friends   in Edinburgh, and elsewhere in Scotland, had never
long    been absent from his thoughts      ;
                                             — and inquiries, made with        an
 almost tremulous anxiety, as to some of those of whom he had had
no recent tidings.      Especially did his recollection then turn towards
the families of Cumming and of Mackenzie, amongst whom there
still survived    a few  of those friends of 1806, with whom he had
shared the intellectual and social enjoyments of his first and
happiest Scottish sojourn.        I venture to give these details, because
his friends    were not all aware of the warmth               and   unalterable
sincerity of his attachment, to which, unless an opportunity was
directly offered through      a letter or a  visit,  he rarely  if ever sought
to give expression.
    At this period, 1859,    he was suffering       severely from attacks of
rheumatism,     which confined       him almest entirely to the house.
Though enjoying tolerable general health,              he became     more and
more of an invalid.       I  ought here to record, that throughout            the
whole of his twenty years' residence at Portree, he was lodged in
the house of     Mr John Cameron, whose attention and kindness                 he
very highly valued.       The knowledge of this circumstance relieved
materially the anxiety of M. Necker's friends.                Nothing in his
last illness requires special    notice.  He     sunk  gradually through in
creasing debility, and without pain, and quietly expired               at 7 p.m.,
on the 20th November        1861, in the seventy-sixth year of his age.

                   Note on  the  Family of M.    L. A.  Necker.
    Since the preceding        biography was drawn up,        I  have received
from    M. Theodore Necker, nephew and nearest surviving relative
of   Professor Necker, some genealogical            particulars which are of
sufficient    interest   to be    here briefly recorded.        The family of
Necker is stated to have been           originally Irish, and to have taken
refnge    in Protestant Prussia during the religious persecutions             of
Queen    Mary of England.          Early in the eighteenth century, Charles
Frederic     Necker, great-grandfather of the subject of our biography,
left   Custrin in Pomerania for Geneva, being charged with the edu
cation of a      young German prince.         He   was  a jurist of eminence,
 and   having determined to settle at Geneva, a          chair of law was in
 stituted    for   him in 1724.        He died in 1760.         His son Louis
 Necker was       Professor   of Mathematics at Geneva, and author            of
 several    works, while another       son was Jacques Necker, the cele
 brated   financier.     These brothers both died in 1804.          The former
 was   grandfather of Louis Albert Necker, the subject of our bio
 graphy, and       father of Jacques Necker who in 1785 married the
 daughter     of de Saussure. This Jacques Necker retreated with his
 family to     England during the French Revolution, and after his
 return  became Professor of Botany at Geneva.             He was remarkable
 for his  unflinching opposition to the French sway. On the Restora
 tion of the    Swiss Government       he was named one of the first magis
 trates  of Geneva,       and died in 1825, very       highly respected and
 regretted.      Besides Louis Albert       Necker, his eldest     son,  he had
 another,    Theodore, and two daughters.
     Hence the subject      of this notice was Professor     at Geneva in the
 fourth  generation.
     M. Theodore Necker (the nephew of my friend) informs me that
 among his uncle's papers there remains nothing like a completed
  *ork, and     little that is available     for publication.     Through the
  kindness   of the   same gentleman, the minerals      collected by    M. Louis
  Necker    during his residence in Scotland have          been   presented to
  the  University of St Andrews.
     I ought, perhaps, to add       (on the authority of M. de Candolle)
  that the  long delay which occurred in the publication of Necker's
  loya<?ecn Ecossc,     to which   I have adverted in the preceding notice,

 70               Proceedings     of the Royal       Society
was iu part due to the detention         of his papers in Scotland       until
after the peace of 1815.
   I have  been indebted     for some    valuable    information respecting
M. Necker's     earlier  history to the kind communications           of Pro
fessor Alfred Gautier, a    distant connection and attached friend of
the subject of this biography.

   These notes are intended to form an appendix              to the  author's
paper on the anatomy and classification            of the Heteropoda, read
before the Society last session.       He finds the relationship between
Firola and Firoloides even closer than he had supposed, and that,
with the exception of gills in the former genus, nearly every ana
tomical   point  occurring in    one,  may be distinctly traced out        in
the other, only differing in relative        characters.     The author de
scribes in detail the anatomy      of Firola, illustrating his description
by a drawing.      He concludes this notice by stating his now con
firmed conviction    of the separation of the sexes in the Heteropoda,
of  some of which he had obtained specimens which were indubit
ably females  ; and he states, in reference to the male sexual organs —
as the result  of the examination     of  some hundreds     of Heteropoda —
that the vas deferens is never traced onwards to the external            male
organ, but that the penis is imperforate        as  in many of the Gastero
poda, is far in advance of the spermatic           opening,   and that these
structures are held in communication         by  a  ciliated groove, capable,
more or less, of being converted into a canal.

ought    to be   separated from Clio caudata and erected into a new

add new     names to a list already large.

L     Notes     on the Geology         of Liineburg, in the kingdom
         of Hanover.         By the Rev. Kobert Boog Watson.
    Liineburg     is the capital    of the old Hanoverian duchy of the
tame name.         It  stands on the small navigable river Ilmenau, about
thirty    miles S.E. from Hamburg,          and about 150 feet above the
sea.     The country around is a flat sandy heath, from which the
gypseous limestone rock of the Kalkberg rises, not unlike Dum
barton Castle, to a height of 180 feet above the plain.            The strata
which here present themselves are —
    1.  Recent sea sand.
    2.  Boulder sand, sometimes 100 feet thick,         full of boulders large
and    small, of gneiss, chalk, flints, flint-fossils, and great lumps of
amber.    — Absent from the site of the town and from the Kalkberg,
but    present at elevations in the neighbourhood        considerably greater
than either.       Liineburg was not therefore, as     it has  been described,
"a Helgoland          in the Boulder Clay sea." (Roth. Zeitschrift der
Deutschen       Geol. Gesell.     1860.)
    3.  Miocene      clay, with fossils, sometimes    from 200 to 300 feet
thick. — It rests unconformably         on the chalk ;  but within the town,
 and round     the Kalkberg, where the chalk is absent, it lies directly
 on the   gypsum.       It has not been disturbed by intrusion from below,
 •a  the  underlying strata have been, but its upper surface has been
 violently torn and abraded during the Boulder Clay period.            It often
 crops out    through the overlying sands, and its presence is generally
 indicated    by fine woods of forest trees.
     4.  Upper white       chalk, with flints and characteristic fossils. —
 Absent     from the site of the town and around the Kalkberg, but
 spreading     out all around, appearing      on the surface, however, only
 in  one  patch on the north side of the town.
     5.  Triassic   clays, limestones,   and shales, with fossils. — Present
 on the    surface only in a patch west of the chalk, and intermediate
  between    the chalk and the Kalkberg, but found below the surface
  in a  thin layer over the entire       site of the town, and further met
  with wherever borings have been made through             the chalk.
     6.  Gypsum and anhydrite.       — Found    wherever borings     have been

80                   Proceedings        of the Royal   Society
made sufficiently         deep.    In   the   Kalkberg    and  the Schildstein,
a   hillock to the west of the Kalkberg, they have penetrated                  the
surface.      In   general, the gypsum        forms but comparatively       a thin
skin over the unaltered anhydrite; but in the Kalkberg, the whole
mass of the rock, which has been quarried to the very heart, is
gypsum.         The gypsum        and anhydrite are a good deal         like one
another; resemble marble; compact, greyish-white in colour, and
slightly translucent.         The gypsum especially is full of fissures, one
of which has been followed 130 feet deep, filled with dolomite;
more commonly           they are filled    with  a gypseous breccia, which       in
one    of the fissures contained the bones of          a recent bat (Vespertilio
noctula).        These fissures produce a false appearance of vertical
bedding.        The crystal Boracite is found in the gypsum and anhy
drite.     It  is only found elsewhere in the precisely similar gypsum
rock of Alsberg, at Segeberg in Holstein.                   Non-crystalline,      it
appears in the Keuper gypsum of Liineville in France.
    No fossils exist.
    The gypsum forms an anticlinal axis, with the Kalkberg for its
highest point, sinking away to the east under the town in the form
of   a narrow      round-backed       bank, which dips steeply to north and
south.      Associated      with the anhydrite     are brine  springs almost at
saturation       point,   coming    to judge by their temperature         from     a
depth of 400 or 500 feet.            These have so exhausted the under sur
face that great subsidences have occurred.
    The points of geological interest connected with this locality are: —
    I.  That it is far the most instructive, and indeed almost the only
place in the great flat of Northern Germany, where the underlying
strata    have been brought           to the surface,   these being    generally
buried deep under sand and clay.
    II.   That there is here an exhibition of           a very peculiar    agency
by which these strata were elevated, and of the time when this
occurred.
    One of these inferior strata is anhydrite,              a sulphate    of lime
deposited from water, but deposited without water of crystallization
entering into its formation.             Later, through exposure to moisture,
 it has accepted water into chemical combination with the sulphuric
acid and lime, and thus changing to gypsum, has expanded                      to   a

                          of Edinburgh,      Session 1862-63.                      81
  Inlk    more than one-fourth          greater than before, an increase nearly
  four times as great as that           of water in freezing.      This expansion,
  prevented      from developing         itself freely, has accumulated       at the
 point of least resistance, and forced up the             Kalkberg just like the
 plug of ice     which rises through the fuse-hole of          a mortar-shell when
 filled with water and frozen.
     The origin of the sulphuric acid cannot be traced.                 Heat, pres
sure,    and strong       brine have all been proved sufficient        to effect the
deposition      of the sulphate of lime iu an anhydrous state.
     The expansion         through metamorphism         must have occurred after
the    deposition of the chalk, and before that of the miocene clay, the
chalk     having     been disturbed,       and the clay thrown down on       it after
its disturbance.
     III.   That the      age  of these gypseous and saline deposits, though
a   difficult question, can be determined.
     No borings have been carried             through the anhydrite to show on
what     it rests.     Evidence of      age therefore   lies in the fossils   of the
overlying strata, which, resting on the gypsum, have been brought
up along with         it.   These    strata are minute in extent, but abound
in    fossils — chiefly casts.        They indicate the Upper Trias, but the
particular member of            it to which the beds are to        be assigned has
been     keenly debated.        Very recently, however, the discovery of five
specimens       of Ceratites nodosus have, in connection with the rest of
 the evidence,      and especially as associated with Myophoria pes anseris,
given the preponderance             in favour of the Lettenkohl.         This is    a
 subordinate       formation now admitted           to exist ;  but whether    to be
ranked as       the highest of the Muschelkalk              or the lowest of the
 Keuper, or a       transition link between the two, is doubtful.          Its flora
connects      it with the Keuper, its fauna with the Muschelkalk.                 In
the    Liineburg beds no vegetable remains have been found, and the
want of these renders the relation of these beds to the Keuper more
obscure.       The absence of such vegetable remains is indeed a char
acteristic     of the Muschelkalk ; but this is but a negative resem
blance, and      its force is counteracted by the absence in the Liineburg
beds    of such distinctive fossils of the Muschelkalk as the Encrinites
Miiformis, Nautilus bidorsatus, Terebratula vulgaris, &c.
     The question         then must be determined          by the Myophoria pes
anteris    and the Cerutites, both of them interesting in themselves

82                    Proceedings         of the Royal Society
from their facility of recognition              and from their very limited range
in time.  The genus Myophoria is confined to the Trias, and the
two deep teeth at the hinge in either valve make it easily recog
nisable from the Trigonia, which has three teeth.           The species Pes
anseris is ribbed, so as        exactly to resemble the foot of a goose. It
does not last on  into the Keuper ; it has just barely begun to ap
pear in the latest strata of the Muschelkalk ; it abounds in almost
incredible     numbers in the intermediate               Lettenkohl.       Now at Liine-
burg,     the limestone      is almost made up of it alone, so abundant                     is
it.     This fact therefore connects these beds with the Lettenkohl.
      The Ceratites   nodosus confirms this conclusion.            The entire genus
is confined     to the Trias.*        It   forms     a    link both in form and in
time between the expiring goniatites and the yet future ammonites.
The Ceratites     nodosus may be very easily recognised                    by the charac
teristic feature of the genus, which               is,   that in each septum all the
lobes which point         in towards the interior of the shell are toothed,
while the projecting rounded                saddle between each two                lobes    is
smooth.       The species       nodosus    is   marked by thick ribs on the sides,
radiating outwards, and terminating just at the edge of the back in
high knobs or knots whence its name. The projection of these
                            ;
knobs being on the side of the shell, the back                 is   rendered unusually
broad, and has        a   very square appearance.              Minute variations           are
very frequent,        but are not sufficient to constitute             more than mere
varieties, and the general marks mentioned are unfailing.
      The Ceratites   nodosus, then, thus easily recognised,               is   confined to      .
the narrowest limits, as  first appears in the upper strata of the Mus
                                it
chelkalk, and disappears finally and for ever in the Lettenkohl, with
out so much as reaching the Keuper.        Wherever found, therefore,
it    stamps the strata with one of the most definite assay-marks                           of
science   ;   and such was the importance attached to its discovery in
the Liineburg strata, that Von Strombeck, the great Triassic autho
rity of northern Germany, in the absence of the solitary specimen
discovered, but unfortunately lost, refused to believe in its exist
ence.      Since then, however, five other specimens have been found.
They     are mere casts, and but broken fragments                    of    an   inch or two
   * It disappears wholly in the Jurassic, but reappears in few species (four
                                                                       a
or five) in the Cretaceous. See Pictet, " Paloontolgie," vol. ii. p. 662. This
is therefore an exception to the absoluteness of what    stated above.

                      of Edinburgh,      Session 1862-63.                         83
in length, and,         as is  bo often the case with ammonites,            seem   to
have     lain long in the water after the death of the animal.                 They
have, however,        the distinct characteristics     of the Ceratites    nodosus.
     These     specimens    have been the more carefully examined,               and
the    inferences deducihle from them the more keenly discussed, from
the fact     that they have been thought to offer some             support to the
 Darwinian       theory of transformation.      Von Strombeck and others         be
 lieve that the latest generations       of the Ceratites   nodosus, as   exhibited
 in the highest       strata of the Muschelkalk elsewhere, show a pro
 gressive     tendency to a certain aberration from the earlier type, as
 figured by       Von Buch in his monograph            " uber Ceratiten."       This
  aberration, though marked,         is not sufficient to constitute,      but may
  be  represented      as a step towards,     a new species.        The Liineburg
  specimens present        this aberration    in its widest form, while still
  obviously belonging       to the species nodosus.       If,  therefore, the beds
  in which they are found can be attributed             to the Lettenkohl, then
  a  greater lapse   of time is secured.     To this lapse of time the change
  of form may be assigned, and thus some colour may be found for
  attributing to this same cause the whole of those minute changes
  of form which the successive species         of ceratites present, and which
  so   completely link them on at either end with the antecedent
  goniatites, and the succeeding ammonites.
      Ab to the question       of form.    The Ceratites of Liineburg differs
  from that figured by       Von Buch in this, that in the latter the knobs
  on   the side are included in the first lobe, while in the Liineburg
  specimens the back is so much broader that the first lobe fails to
   reach so   far  as the knobs, and the second saddle is as         it were drawn
   off the side    towards the back, and it therefore, instead of the first
   lobe,  thus includes      the knobs.      Von Buch's drawings, however,
  though    otherwise most careful, and in this case professedly made
  from the     same specimen, do not agree with one another (see " uber
   Ceratiten," Plate I. fig. 1, and Plate      II.  fig. 1.) in this very respect
  of the relation of the knobs to the lobes and saddles
                                                                       ; and so, in
  regard    to this particular point,       nothing can       be  made of them.
  Further,     it appears that in all young specimens the back is rela
  tively narrow, and the first lobe       extending round the corner of the
  back at    that period of life reaches the knobs on the side            ;  but in
  variably, as the shell increases      with  age, the back becomes       relatively

 84               Proceedings      of the Royal    Society
 broader, and then it is only the second saddle instead of the             first
 lobe which includes    the knobs.      The only peculiarity then of the
 Liineburg specimens is precisely        what   in other   cases  would       be
 called a  dwarfing — i.e., the signs of    age   appearing in connection
 with smallness of size     ; which fact, taken in connection with the
 rarity of this fossil in the Liineburg beds, probably points to the
 existence of climatic or other circumstances unfavourable to the life
 of this cephalopod.
    The other question, that, namely, of the lapse of time, — in other
words, whether the Liineburg strata are Lettenkohl or not, — must be
 settled on its own merits.      Admitting the Lettenkohl      as a  distinct
subordinate formation      later than the Muschelkalk, then it appears
that the Myophoria Pes anseris is rare in the Muschelkalk, abun
dant in the Lettenkohl, and abundant          at Liineburg   ; its evidence
therefore points to the identity of the Liineburg strata with the
Lettenkohl. On the other hand, the Ceratites nodosus is frequent
in the Muschelkalk, but hitherto unknown           in the Lettenkohl     ;   its
evidence therefore, unlike the other, rather connects the         Liineburg
beds with the Muschelkalk.          In other words, the Myophoria Pes
anseris proves that these strata are not Muschelkalk but Lettenkohl,
while the Ceratites nodosus shows that they lie nearer the Muschel
kalk than any Lettenkohl strata yet found.
    As regards the underlying gypseous limestone, this conclusion
determines its age as greater than that of part of the Lettenkohl.
That it is much older is not likely ; and the existence elsewhere             in
the Lettenkohl of similar formations,       accompanied as here      by salt,
indicates that the Kalkberg of Luneberg belongs to the Upper           Trias,
and probably to the Lettenkohl itself.
    Curiously enough,    this conclusion     dissociates  Liineburg     from
Germany, where the Lettenkohl is not at all, or but very slightly,
saliferous, —the saline deposits of Germany being found in the lower
Muschelkalk, — and connects it with France, Switzerland, and Eng
land, where    it is in the Lower Keuper distinctively that salt is
richly present.

  1.  On the Influence of Weather upon Disease and              Mortality.
      By K. E. Scoresby- Jackson,          M.D.,    F.R.S.E., F.R.C.P.,
      Lecturer on Materia Medica and Therapeutics at Surgeons'
     Hall, Edinburgh.
     In the early part of this paper the author adverts to the an
 tiquity of researches into the causal relations of health and mor
 tality.     Nevertheless,   long   as these   have   been the   subject   of
 inquiry, the literature of medical meteorology is meagre in the
 extreme ; and in proportion to the time and labour bestowed upon
 the many other branches of medical science, this department            may
 justly   be regarded    as having met with unmerited        neglect.    Re
 ference is made, however,        to the names of many eminent         phy
 sicians, whose researches into the influence of weather upon the
 human constitution have contributed           not a little to adorn the
 medical literature of the present century.
     It is well known that the influence       of external  agencies upon
 health differs materially with locality,    so that the author feels  him
self at liberty to make such investigations into the subject of his
paper as he may think sufficient to ascertain approximately              the
 relationship   subsisting  between the weather and mortality in Scot
land,     without particular reference to the works         of authors    on
kindred subjects      in other countries.    It  is quite possible that  the
results evoked by Casper in Berlin, Quetelet in Brussels, Boudin in
Paris, Emerson in Philadelphia, Farr or Guy in London, and by
Stark in Edinburgh, may differ widely in many of the leading
features of the inquiry, and yet the inferences of each be correct in

                      of Edinburgh,    Session 1862-63.                      87
  themselves.     The author therefore believed that it would          be much
  more to the      interest  of science to pursue        his researches inde
  pendently of all previous inquiry, divesting himself of all foregone
  conclusions, and making the facts which he has collected speak for
  themselves.     By following this plan he derives two advantages             :
 firstly, that of avoiding     a tedious   recapitulation     of the facts and
  deductions    to be found     in other works; and,         secondly,  that of
  drawing    an  unbiassed opinion upon the subject,            which may the
  more confidently, on that account, be employed in comparison with
  results obtained in other localities.
     The difficulties attending inquiries into the influence of weather
 upon mortality are manifold and intricate. All other causes, to
 which might, altogether or in part,       be due the facts observed, must
 be abstracted      and carefully weighed      before the true balance of
 meteorological     influence can be justly ascertained       ;  and when this
 is done, there still remains     a deduction  to be made for error arising
 from the unequal distribution of meteorological phenomena even
over an area so limited as that of a single city. Whether de
 pendence can be placed upon the accuracy of tho returns of the
 causes of death made to the Registrar- General is another question
 of   serious  importance    in such investigations.        These    and many
other obstacles arise to bar logical exactness        ;  but where the aim is
simply to obtain an approximate knowledge of the subject, the
 author believes his data are abundantly accurate.
    The meteorological data are taken from the collected returns
from all the stations of the Meteorological Society of Scotland, as
reduced by the Astronomer-royal.           The stations have a mean lati
tude of 56° 30'      N., mean longitude of      3° 4'    W., and   a mean ele
vation of 222 feet nearly.
    The mortality tables are constructed from the returns made by
the Registrar-General for Scotland respecting the eight larger
towns.      The period over which the investigations extend is six
years — namely,      from 1857 to 1862 inclusive. The meteorological
data did not admit of extension over a longer period.              The author
regrets that he is unable to include ozone and electricity in his in
vestigations.     With respect to electricity, he has no data applicable
to the places and period under examination         ;    and with reference to
ozone, he submits, that until the chemistry          of that subtile agency

88                    Proceedings     of  the Royal Society
is better established, its influence          upon the human    frame cannot
be determined.           The grand total of deaths from all causes under
consideration       during the six years was 143,249, and the average
population       867,313.     The corrected population for each year is
employed        as  the standard of reference for each year's mortality.
 The inquiry is led into the influence            of weather upon mortality
 from individual diseases,        aud the several classes of disease, as well
 as  into the mortality from all causes.           A detailed  account of the
 inferences deduced by these investigations would involve the repro
 duction     of  a series  of tables and diagrams for which the Society's
 Proceedings       are  not available, and all of which will be found in the
 extended paper.
 2.   History of Popular Literature, and its Influence on So
          ciety.     By Win. Chambers, Esq., of Glenormiston.
     Having introduced         the subject,    Mr Chambers referred to the
 earliest examples of popular         literature in the reign of Elizabeth    ;
 they were embelished with wood engravings, believed to be executed
 in Germany.           Such was the origin of those very curious tracts
 known as "       chap books," now very rare, and much prized by biblio
 graphic amateurs.         The subjects of these books resembled the Folk-
  Lore of the Germans, and were the embodiment of the superstitions,
  fancies, and traditions      of a much earlier period ; the least excep
  tionable being the ballads of a heroic and tender kind.            Next was
  traced the rise of newspapers, and the importance they began to as
  sume in the reign of Queen Anne, a period also signalised             by the
  popular writings of Steele, Addison, and Defoe.            The imposition of
  the stamp-duty        in 1712 checked this sudden rise of popular litera
  ture  ;  and various circumstances        postponed its reappearance until
  the reigns of George       IV.  and   William IV., by which time great
  advances had been made in education             and in a general    taste for
 literature,— the writings of Cowper, Burns, Campbell, Wordsworth,
 Scott, Byron, and others, along with the influence of certain reviews
 and magazines, having latterly given             much   impetus to thought.
 Mr Chambers then spoke of the origin of Chambers' Journal in
 February 1832, the Penny Magazine in the subsequent March, and
 other cheap prints, devoted in an especial manner to popularise

                    of Edinburgh,     Session 1862-63.                    89
 literature.    Finally, he drew attention       to the abolition of fiscal
 duties on the products    of the press, — the prodigious copiousness of
 cheap popular sheets, cheap newspapers included, — and the capacity
of modern machinery, moved by steam-power, for their rapid pro
duction.     On investigation, he found that only       a  small proportion
of the whole was      of an immoral, or otherwise      objectionable kind ;
much    of the writing in this popular department of literature being
by authors of repute, to whom large sums were paid for their services.
He estimated that there were not fewer than three hundred millions
of newspapers now circulated       per annum     in the United Kingdom       ;
while     the quantity of cheap literary sheets         issued   per  annum
amounted      to 144,000,000.     He concluded by referring to the highly
improved     tone in all departments of the press, not the least of the
beneficial   effects of modern popular literature being      the extinction
of what was worthless       and pernicious.     On concluding his paper,
Mr Chambers laid on the table a quantity of copies privately printed
for  distribution among the members present.
     The following note from             Principal Sir David Brewster
 was   read by Professor      Tait : —
    "
       I send  you, for the Royal Society, six of my best specimens of
 Decomposed      Glass.   In presenting them, perhaps you might men
 tion the disappearance     of all colour, by introducing a drop of water,
 and the passage of a prismatic        line over each film, owing to the
 water entering more quickly between some of the elementary films
 than between     others.   These may be found by using a balsam that
 will quickly indurate."

1.    Sketch of the Recent Progress of Sanskrit Literature.
     By John Muir, D.C.L., LL.D.                       (This Paper was given at
     the request of the Council.)
     After giving    a   sketch of the first beginnings of these studies in
India, and their further prosecution in Europe, the author adverted
to the relations of Sanskrit with the Greek, Latin, and Teutonic
languages,      and showed how this affinity established                       the common
origin of the nations by which these languages have been spoken.
He then proceeded to give an account of Indian literature, com
mencing with the hymns and other constituent                        parts of the Vedas,
and then proceeding to the principal systems of Indian philosophy,

                    of Edinburgh,     Session 1862-63.                    91
of which he furnished an outline.         He then gave  a short statement
of the rise and progress of Buddhism, and concluded by merely re
ferring to the later developments of Indian religion and literature,
and to the versatility of the Indian intellect as evinced by the
variety of its literary productions.
2.  On a Pre-Brachial          Stage in the Development of Coma-
   tula, and its importance          in Relation to certain      Aberrant
   Forms of Extinct Crinoids.             By Professor Allman.
   The author described        a stage  in the development     of Comaiula
subsequent to the free stage of the larva,         and anterior   to that in
which it acquires arms.        He believed that the subject of the paper
was  of much interest in affording a key to the nature of certain*
aberrant forms of extinct Crinoidea, such as Haplocrinus, Stephano-
crinus, &c.,   for the peculiarities of these genera were for the most
part  exhibited in the young Comatula, where they admitted of an
easy  determination     as elements   in the composition of the Crinoid.

      In presenting the           Neill Prize, the Chairman made the
following           remarks : —
      Before    presenting the     Neill Medal to Dr Greville, in conformity
*'ith the      decision of the Council, it may be proper for the informa-
tlon     of strangers,     and even of many Fellows of the Society, to give
8 brief
           notice     of the bequest to science which        was made by the late
 J)r
       Patrick      Neill.
     Although        Dr Neill was   a   member of this Society, he never took
sn
      active   part in its proceedings, and       I   believe never communicated
aDJ paper to          its Transactions.      He   was one   of the founders of the
Wernerian           Society, and discharged the duties of its Secretary during
the
       thirty yearsof its existence under the able presidency of Pro
fessor    Jameson.   The Wernerian Society was, indeed, the rival of
the
    Royal Society of Edinburgh, and its seven volumes of Trans
itions contain many papers by distinguished writers which would
otherwise       have been communicated            to this Society.
         Neill'sfirst publication appeared    1806, and was entitled
                                                       in
       Tour through some of the Islands of Orkney and Shetland."
 ^
      l829 he published his " Horticultural Tour in Flanders," and in
     voi. v.                                                             n

 republication     of the article " Horticulture           in the Edinburgh
 Encyclopedia.        Dr Neill communicated          only two papers to the
Wernerian Transactions,          one entitled    "A List of Fishes in the
Forth, and Lakes and Rivers near Edinburgh," and another "On
the Fossil Remains of the Beaver in Perthshire and Berwickshire."
    Dr Neill died in 1851, and bequeathed to the Royal Society of
                                        " the interest of which was to be
Edinburgh the sum of L.500,
applied in furnishing a medal every second or third year to any
distinguished Scottish Naturalist, to         be adjudicated   by the Council
of the Society."
   In fulfilling this    trust, the Council wisely adopted the triennial
in place of the biennial period, and the first adjudication             of the
prize was made to        Dr Lauder Lindsay for his researches on the
structure of lichens.
   The second adjudication was made to Dr Robert Kaye Greville

                                                    History, more especially
in the department        of Cryptogamic       Botany,   including his recent
papers on Diatomaceee."
   Dr Grcville's contributions to Natural History have been both
numerous and valuable, and their merits have been recognised by
the most distinguished Botanists of the age.             nis " Scottish Cryp
                   " was                                                   His
togamic Flora               published between 1823 and 1828.
"Flora Edinensis" appeared in 1828. His Algae Britannicw, "
or, Description    of Marine and other Inarticulated Plants in Britain
belonging     to the order Algae," was published in 1830, and he has
inserted    in the " Microscopical Journal " no fewer than twelve
papers    on the     Diatomaceai,     an   interesting subject     which still
occupies his attention.
   But Dr Grcville's services      to science have not been     limited by his
writings. He has     been an ardent collector     of plants and other objects
of natural history; and his complete herbarium of Phanerogamous
and Cryptogamous        plants, as well as his collection of insects, have
been placed in the Museum          of our University.       He has also made
a  collection of land and fresh-water mollusca, which is the finest
in Scotland.
   These various contributions       to natural    history have been highly
appreciated     both in this and      in foreign   countries.    In 1824 the

                             of Edinburgh, Session 1862-63.                                      95
1'iiiversity          of Glasgow conferred   Dr Greville the degree of
                                                            upon
Doctor        of Laws, and many of the Natural History Societies in
Europe        and America have received him among their corresponding
or honorary           members.
   Though somewhat foreign                        to the present occasion, the Society
will,    I   trust,    excuse me for adding, that                  l)r Greville has taken an
active       part in those interesting questions                   of philanthropy, on the
Hilution of which                 the happiness             and security of society depend.
He has        felt, as       I   am    sure most of us here feel, that there is some
thing greater than science, and something                            higher and more endur
ing than fame            ;   and it is no slight ground of congratulation,                     that
wine of those who                     have been         commissioned         by their Maker to
study His works, and to sound the depths of His wisdom and His
power, have shunned the fatal course which others have pursued,
of sapping the           foundations           of that faith and hope which science               is
so able       to sustain.
    Dr Grevillb,             In       the name of the Council            I   now beg to present
to you       the Neill Medal, and to congratulate                         you on this honour,
which        you have so well merited.

as the       existence of such cavities with a polarising structure around

 3. On     a  Clay Deposit with Fossil Arctic Shells, recently
      observed in the Basin of the Forth.                  By the Kev. Thomas
      Brown, F.R.S. E.
     The author having stated the circumstances                   which  led to his
 discovering     this   bed   with its fossils near the harbour at Elie,          re
 ferred to a drawing of the section, and explained the position and
 contents of the different strata.
     Specimens     of the shells were exhibited,            as named by      Dr Otto
 Torrell of Lund, who had supplied important information as to their
distribution. They are all, without exception, now living in the
 Arctic   Seas.    A majority of them          are   exclusively Arctic.     Several
 are    new to the British glacial deposits — viz., Thracia                 mxjopais,
Pecten     groenlandicus,        Crenella   decussala,   C. Icevigata,*   Turrilella
erosa,\ and a new Yoldia found in Spitzbergen                    in  80° north  lati
 tude.J    It  was shown how         strongly this evidence goes to prove the
former existence of a          Boreal or Arctic climate in Scotland.
     The shells    seem    also to indicate        some   considerable   rise in the
level of the land.                                            —
                          They ure deep-water species some of them very
markedly so.         Four distinct series of facts appear to show that
they have not been washed up and transported,                     but are lying in
the clay-bed      where they originally           lived.   As the deposit is now
rather above high-water mark, the fair inference would seem to be
   • " Most probably, but much injured."

Astarte compresea, Leda truncata, L. pygmcca, Natica yrocnlmulica, large form.
Fragments also occur which seem to belong to Cyprina Islandica and Mya
truncata.

that the whole       sea-bed of the      Firth must have been considerably
raised.
     Reference    was made to the discovery of the glacial beds of the
Clyde by       Mr Smith of Jordanhill.          They had     been looked for on the
Forth, but      without success.        Dr Fleming struck the first trace of
them     Tyrie, but it was faint, there being only two or three
          at
specimens of the shells, and these he was led to think not indigen
ous.      In the Elie clay the same two species occur rather abundantly,
along     with others, all evidently in the clay- bed where they had
lived.     The group is    so characteristic          that there need be no ques
tion now       as to the occurrence        of the true old glacial beds with
Arctic shells      in the basin of the Forth.
     Various reasons were stated for holding that this bed is very
closely connected      with the boulder clay, being not improbably                a sea-
formation                   with some portion of that deposit.

us some glimpse into the circumstances   under which the period of
Arctic cold passed away.
     The submerged forests of the Fifeshire coast were referred to in
connection       with the information which this section            seems to    furnish
as   to the somewhat       obscure question of their true stratigraphical
position.
4.     On the     Remarkable Occurrence                 of Graphite in Siberia.
                        By Thomas C. Archer, Esq.
     The author in this paper gives the localities of three large mines
of this mineral.         The first situated in the Semipalatinsk district,
Western         Siberia, between 47° and 50° N. Lat., and in 80° E.
Long,      from Greenwich,     on the Kirghesiau             Steppe.     The locality
of the mine        is remarkably barren, and upon digging down a few
feet, the      graphite is found lying in a continuous stratum which has
been      ascertained to extend over a space of 2100 acres.                   This im
mense      deposit belongs   to Messrs Samsonof             and Mamontof of Ser-
 Uupol,    and is worked for commercial             purposes.
     The second deposit is    of   a   similar character      as to its stratification     ;
 but instead      of being covered with         a bed    of peaty soil, as in the case
of the     former,   it has overlying     it,   a   stratum of spathose iron ore of

98                           Proceedings            of the Royal           Society
a   very peculiar texture,                    being close grained and black, and break
ing with          a   remarkable         conchoidal        fracture.           Tbis mine        is situated
in Eastern Siberia, on the Lower Tunguska, about 240 miles from
its confluence with the Ye-nee-sey,                  its geographical position                         being
between 50° and 65°                   N. Lat., and in 102° E. Long.
   The bank of the river for 1960 feet is formed entirely by a sec
tion of the graphite stratum, varying from 35 inches to 5 feet in
thickness, and above                    it,   often receding          several feet, the stratum of
spathose-iron               ore, also about         5   feet      in thickness.          These beds of
graphite and iron ore being washed                           by   the river floods, are quite bare
for from         30 to 105 feet           inland, where           a   bank begins to rise, formed
by the detritus              of   a   mountain        side   ;    one of the chain of Alexyef,
which itself           is   placed about 1800 feet from the shore.                             This   moun
tain     is   composed of gneiss, and                it   has not been ascertained whether
either of the strata above                      mentioned          pass    into the mountain,              but
they have been traced nearly to the base by borings, and have                                           been
found to extend,                  without varying very much in thickness,                             over       a
space      of about         19C0      square feet, computed                    to contain      12,000,000
cubic feet of graphite.
    The author believes that no similar                                 beds    or strata of graphite
have ever been discovered, this mineral usually being in imbedded
masses,          rarely very large, or in large nodules                         in   pockets    formed       in
trap aud other igneous rocks.
    The third mine described — namely, that of M. Alibert —                                            is    of
this character.               It   is   also   in   Eastern Siberia, at the foot of Mount
Balagool,         98°       30"    E. Long., by         52°       20"    N. Lat.,      200 miles        west
from       Irkutsk.          Mount Balagool               is      composed chiefly of sieuite,
and    it   is    by   laborious operations               that the graphite            is   raised to the
surface.         The mines          are worked by the              half-wild Iiuriates of the              dis
trict but the quality of the graphite
       ;                                so remarkably fine that   is                                         it
amply repays the labour,  L.1200 worth having being raised    the                                     in
first four months.
    The author called attention                      to these mines, because,                   from their
vastness, as compared with other graphite deposits, they assume                                              a
                      importance, and are rendered peculiarly interesting

most important and hopeful character for observers to follow up in
future.

 3.   On a new        fossil Ophiuridan, from Post-pliocene strata of
           the valley of the Forth.            By Professor Allman.
    I  am     indebted     to one of our University        students,    Mr Peter
 Lawson, for a specimen          of  a star-fish,  which he informed me had
been found,        along with many others, in a deposit of brick-clay near
Dunbar.         The interest of this fact was a sufficient inducement to
cause    me at once to        visit the locality where the star-fish was         ob
tained, and where,         by the kindness of Mr France, the proprietor of
the brick-works,         I  succeeded in obtaining good specimens of the
fossil.
    Notwithstanding          some   very   marked    characters,   which might
possibly be regarded as possessing           higher than specific value,     I pre
fer referring        the star-fish of the Dunbar brick-clay to         Miiller  and
Troschel's genus Ophiolepis, rather than encumbering                 the existing
nomenclature         with  a new and   doubtful generic name.        The species,
which     is very distinct from every other described member of the
genus, may be defined           by the following diagnosis : —
                       Ophiolepis gracilis (mihi), nov. spec.
    Upper surface of the disc covered with imbricated             plates, a single
circular plate         occupying the centre, and with the radial shields
large,   and having their opposed edges in contact for their entire
length.       Dorsal shields of the arms about twice            as broad as    long
near   the disc, and thence with their breadth            gradually decreasing
in  proportion to their length, until towards the distal extremity of
the arm        they become longer than broad ; they cover the whole
dorsal   surface of the arm, and have their adoral and aboral margins
transverse       and parallel.      Ventral shields of the arms very minute,
and   allowing the lateral         shields of one side to meet those of the
opposite side       in the inferior median line of the arm.         Aboral edge
of each lateral        shield with   a notch   for the exit of a cirrus.    Spines
about    once and a-half as long as the breadth of the arms.                 Arms
about five      times as long as the diameter of the disc, and gradually
tapering to a fine point.
    The size      of the largest specimens obtained is about four inches
from tip to       tip of the arms.

    One of the most remarkable features in the present species is the
 rudimental     condition    of the ventral     shields  of the arms    ; these
 shields being      much smaller     than in Ophiolepis     ciliata (Miil.  and
      Fossil in brick-clay of the Post-pliocene age, near Dunbar, Scotland.
   OphioUpis gracilit — (A) viewed from the dorsal side, slightly enlarged     ;
(B) ventral wall of one of the arms still more enlarged viewed from within     ;
showing the lateral shields slightly separated from one another along the

angles. The apertures for the exit of the ambulacral cirri are seen near the
outer edges of the lateral shields.
Trosch.), where they are exceptionally small among the Ophiuridce,
and where the lateral shields bear only short papilliform spines
instead of the long, highly-developed spines of 0. gracilis.            It was

                      of Edinburgh,        Session 1862-63.                         103
 only after     having sought in vain for the ventral shields in some
 dozens   of specimens that        I succeeded in detecting them in a single
 instance.      In this   case they appeared     in   a view    of the internal sur
face    of the ventral wall (fig.         B) as  very minute rhombic              plates
lying along the mesial            line, where they were interposed between
the angles       of the lateral shields.        It  is quite possible that the
ventral plates are more          fully displayed    upon the outer surface of
the  wall, but     in no   case did   I find this surface sufficiently exposed
to enable    me to obtain a view of them            ;  while the inner surface,
on the    contrary, was frequently well exposed by the disappearance
in the   fossil of the dorsal shields, and of the series of vertebra-like
ossicles,   which, in the living Ophiuridce occupies the axis of the
arms.      In most of the specimens sufficiently well preserved to afford
a view    of the ventral walls of the arms, the lateral shields were
seen   to be slightly separated from one another along the ventral
suture,   leaving here a distinct but narrow fissure, which was not
interrupted even by the intervention of the minute ventral plates,
which     had in almost every case disappeared.                 In  some instances,
however,     the lateral      shields   escaped    displacement,        and the two
series were then      in contact with one another along the line of suture.
The notch for the exit of the cirri or tentacular ambulacra, situated
on   the aboral      edge of every lateral      plate, is very distinct, and is
completed      into an entire aperture by the adoral edge of the plate
next    in succession.        The spines along the sides of the arms are
 long and slender      ;  in no   case, however, could       I  satisfy myself that
 more   than a single spine was borne by each lateral shield                ;   but the
condition of the specimens does not              justify    our thus limiting the
number      of those spines.         Neither  was    I  able to discover in the
specimens      any evidence of scales over the apertures for the cirri.
    The deposit in which Ophiolepis            gracilis occurs is a fine dense
tenacious     blue clay of Post-pliocene age.             It  is situated upon the
shore of the      Firth of Forth, about two miles to the west of Dunbar,
 and is   largely worked for the manufacture of bricks.                  It   lies low  ;
 and  were it not for an artificial embankment, would                  be flooded at
 high tide.
    In this deposit, at about five feet from the surface, is a horizontal
 bed, where the star-fishes are found.           They occur in great numbers
 npon the surface        of the bed, which is occasionally           separated from
                                                                           o 2

the bed above      it by   a thin parting of fine sand. They are remark
able for their unmutilated condition, lying there with their slender
arms, even to the extreme points, in the position which they must
have naturally held during life, thus showing an entire absence                of
that spontaneous dismemberment             which is   so characteristic  of the
Ophiuridce when dying under any prolonged irritation, and indicat
ing some sudden cause of deprivation of life, such as we may sup
pose to result from an irruption of fresh water into the part of the
sea inhabited      by them.
   None of the specimens            I obtained,   however, were sufficiently
well preserved to enable me to make out all their characters                   as
completely as      I  could have wished, the nature of the clay in which
they were imbedded being apparently not suited to the preservation
of the more delicate structures.          The oral surface of the disc, espe
cially, was in no      case retained so   perfectly as to allow of the mouth
or the disposition        of the plates of this part of the animal being
observed.      It  was only in some instances that traces of the spines
were visible,     and then almost the only indications left were           their
impressions in the surrounding clay.
   It  is a curious and interesting fact, that not only did all the
specimens found belong to a single species, but that not a               vestige
of a shell, or of any other organism, could be detected in any              part
of the clay which       I  had an opportunity of examining.

 connecting   the Nelson Monument and the Observatory;           and finding

 that plumbers (employed by the Town-Council) were removing the
 old lead and substituting new in its place, and being also encouraged
  by Professor  P. G. Tait, who with me visited the spot, to          believe
  that the markings which had been         discovered were electrically of
  unusual interest,  I lost no time in applying to       Mr  J. D. Marwick,
 town-clerk, for those portions of the leaden covering which con
 tained the marks in question, with the view of presenting them to
 the Royal Society.
     Mr Marwick was     as obliging  as prompt    in responding to such a
 request, and sent me    the required specimens next day, accompanied
 by the    enclosed   memorandum       written   by   Mr H., assistant      to
 Mr Cousin, city-architect.

     " The
           accompanying pieces of lead were taken from the north
 west side of the lead platform on the roof of the lower part of
 Nelson's Monument.
    " The  distance between the holes was about nine feet six inches.
    " Both holes were immediately over        a block-tin gas-pipe, which
 is here carried under the lead and boarding of the platform, and
 which was found melted the whole length between the two               holes,
 and a foot beyond the north-east hole.
    " These holes in the lead were evidently
                                                     directly caused by   the
 burning gas from the pipes underneath.

two holes A and B. CD shows the gas-pipe under and between
them.
    " From this sketch we might naturally expect a hole melted in
the lead at A, the pipe being here at its highest level immediately
under the boarding, only one inch from the lead.
    " The pipe between C and D would
                                               very quickly    be melted by

on   by   a  flame issuing from it.
    "
       At D the pipe dips vertically about eighteen inches.
    "
       It is evident that the vertical length of pipe DE would not
be   readily melted by the strong flame burning at D.
    "
       The boarding and lead at B, immediately over D, would there
fore be exposed         to the flame of the gas for a much              longer time
than any part between           A  and B.      And here we might expect what
we find, a large piece of the boarding burnt, and the larger of the
two holes in the accompanying pieces of lead.
     " How the
                     gas was at first ignited remains to be shown.
                                                                             "H."
     The above memorandum              gives an excellent matter-of-fact de
 scription     of what chiefly remained           to be seen     at the time when
 it was     written, but    it does not mention what had much struck me
 several days      previously, when      I first caught     sight of the small and
 neat   oblong hole in the roof at           A  ;   and, on subsequently      pulling
 up the leads,     which at that time had not         been disturbed at   that place
 since the storm,        I found the under        surface of the metal strangely
barred and scored           around   the aperture, and also perceived small
globules      of melted lead, driven away apparently by some radiating
force    from the hole, until caught and jammed between the remain
ing    uninjured lead and its wooden surface of support.*                    Neither
does the memorandum              account for the first igniting of the gas,
but expressly says,          that what may have caused that " remains to
be   shown."
    This is in truth the most important part of the whole affair, and
which      I will now endeavour to describe.
    The evening of the 4th of February 1863 ushered in one of the
most    violent     storms of thunder and lightning             that has  been    ex
perienced      in Edinburgh, and perhaps in most parts of Scotland, for
 many     years, and its violence was all the more remarkable, inasmuch
 as the     month     of February is near the minimum of the year for
    *
       These globules had very imperfect adhesion, and had mostly dropped off
 when the    plate was presented to the Royal Society     ; but some few of the more
 'hstant ones   still remained, and all the others had left marks, usually of        a
  yellowish  colour, showing their former positions, sizes, and shapes.

    The storm, then,         was anomalous      in its season  of occurrence, and
in its violence     ;   also, as it would appear from the newspaper accounts,
by the regularity and broad spread of its passage over the country
from west to east, occurring nearly an hour earlier at Greenock than
at Aberdeen       or Edinburgh.           In   Glasgow   and its neighbourhood
several buildings were struck, a tall chimney and a church entirely
ruined   ;  a lodging-house          of operatives injured in every floor ; and
a large number of the telegraph instruments of the Private Tele
graph Company thrown out of order, and one clerk rendered
senseless.
    This storm began in Edinburgh about'7" p.m., and lasted nearly an
hour ; it came with very strong west wind, and accompaniments of

 on the Calton        Hill    at the time, as being      most remarkable for the
slanting, almost horizontal,            direction   of the lightning,     as well  as

ingly loud, and on one occasion apparently coincident with the flash                        ;
shaking       the house he was in (the old Observatory Tower), and
giving the idea that either that building, or the Royal Observatory,
must have been struck.              Going out immediately to            see what    might
have    happened, he met the servant at the door, who spoke of the
flash   of lightning         having entered the lowest room of that tower,
"
   gone     half way across the floor," and left an overpowering                     smell
of   "brimstone" behind; and also called his attention to Nelson's
Monument, about 200 yards east-south-east                      of them, being appa
rently on fire, because sparks were             issuing from the roof of one of
the   low rooms at its foot, on the western side.
    Now, at the winter period of the year,                it  seems     that the tenant
there    (Mrs               ) finding the above monumental building very
cold, prefers       to live in a wooden house close by, and on the evening
of the    4th of February she was in that house                  ill and in bed      ;  but
when the        particular flash occurred which had been so much noticed
by   Mr Wallace and the Observatory servant, it seemed close to her
also,   rilled her house with the brimstone              odour, and so firmly im
 pressed    her with the belief that the Monument had been struck,
 that she sent out her servant             " to  see  if the time-ball was        still at
 the top    of the building ;" believing that            if mischief      had occurred
 anywhere from           lightning,    it would be near the summit of the
 structure.       The answer, however, brought back                was, that  the time-
 ball was quite        safe, but that sparks were coming out of the roof of
 the low      west room.        The policeman        of the hill was likewise on
 the   ground almost immediately             after the flash, and testified            both
 to the then      sudden appearance of sparks issuing from the roof of the
 uninhabited room, and            its accompaniment,by            the traditional sul
  phurous     smell in the air of strong lightning, or
                                                                   " ozone."
     The door      of the Monument         was    then speedily opened, access to
  the roof    obtained, and the new-lit fire, caused by the burning of gas
  and wooden       rafters, speedily extinguished.           In this    manner the gas,
  no doubt,     after   it was set on fire, did much         mischief to both leaden
  roof and      wooden rafters,       especially     at the place on the           sketch
  marked      B, which contains         big and rather confused holes           ;   but   if
  any one      still asks what first set the gas on fire,             I  think there is
  equally    little doubt that we may answer               "  it was that particular

the residents on the      hill      so much at the        time."
   We may prohably also assume that the lightning struck at the
point A.  I had already been directed to that point from the

not imagine why the fluid should have pierced a hole through
a good conductor,     viz., a sheet of lead.               On mentioning this diffi
culty to Professor Tait, he           remarked,
                                                " that if the hole was due to
the immediate action of tho spark, I might be quite sure that there
was a conductor below, which the lightning was trying to get at
and   pass   off by," and after that opinion had been so expressed, the

    However      anomalous, therefore, the case may appear at first, some
theoretical      principles    are remarkably     borne out by it   ;  and that the
foot  of the building should have been struck, and not the top, seems
to   follow from the low, level and almost horizontal direction                      in
which the       lightning     was sensibly    observed to come, and with the
wind and        rain, —causing      thereby    the windward foot of the tall
building     to become for that occasion the shortest passage for the
fluid to reach the ground by.
    In such     a case, though,     it may   be suggested,    that the long hori
zontal     wire extending through a length of 4000 feet between
the   Nelson Monument and the castle for the service of the time-
gun,    should      have been most abundantly charged                by induction.
That is true        ; and there is little doubt but that the said wire was
copiously      filled, and might have produced dangerous effects, had
it not     been furnished at either end with large copper plates in
close   proximity to many pronged conductors ending in wet earth,
which led away innocuously the greater part of the charge.                  Enough
however       still remained to do some singular damage to the elec
trically controlled clocks at either end of the line.                     Thus, the
members of one of the bundles of permanent magnets, near the
pendulum-bob of the castle clock,                 had their poles changed          and
their new        attraction made rather stronger than their old ; the
 members       of a similar bundle in the Observatory window-clock
 had    their poles partially         changed   ;   and in the interior       of the
 Normal      Mean Time clock            one of the gold contact          points    was
partially    fused, and spattered on its steel spring, which was blued
 at that    part as though by heat.
     The    gold contact point thus treated,          it will be understood, was
 in direct   metallic connection at the instant with the long open-air
 wire;    and the magnets that were altered were in indirect connec-
    *
       Professor   Tait  has also remarked, and it seems well worthy to be noted
 as a memorandum        for any future occasion, that it would have been advisable
 to have   preserved the boarding at "     A,"  as well as the lead ; for the manner
 of action and of piercing through       wood by lightning is very different    to the
  burning action of flame ; and      thick wooden planking    uxu everywhere     inter

tion, or rather, in inductive position, for they were surrounded at
the time by the wire coil of the pendulum-bob, whose composing
wire is a connected continuation of the long open-air wire.
   To this it only remains to add, that these lightning-made mag
nets at the Castle clock, when duly replaced in the bundle suitably
with their new poles, have given the most steady and satisfactory
results in working the control of the clock ever since.

3.   On Earth-Currents during Magnetic Calms, and their
    Connection with Magnetic Changes.           By Balfour Stewart,
    Esq., M.A., F.B.S.        Communicated by Professor Tait.
   In two previous communications         made by the author    to    the
Royal Society of London, it had been endeavoured to show            that
earth- currents and aurone, which occur simultaneously with       mag
netic   storms, are secondary currents    due to the small but   abrupt
changes in the magnetism of the earth which such storms         denote.
Earth- currents also occur during periods of magnetic calm, but     they
can then be rendered visible only by means of a delicate             gal
vanometer.
   Such has been constructed by       Mr C. V. Walker, who has by its
means registered those earth-currents      which occurred during     the
three last months of 1851, a period of magnetic calm.
   The object of the present communication is to discuss those
observations of Mr Walker in connection with the simultaneous
 changes which took place in the values of the declination and
the horizontal force component of the earth's magnetism, these
 changes being furnished by means of continuously acting      magneto-
 graphs at Kew Observatory.       By this method Mr Walker's obser
 vations were divided into three classes,  —
    1st class.  Observations during moments of magnetic calm.
    2d     „     Observations during minor magnetic disturbances.
    3d     „     Observations during greater magnetic disturbances.

                     of Edinburgh,      Session 1862-63.                   113
    In the first of these classes a law of hours was manifestly ob
 served,   the values of the earth-currents      for the hours of the night
 being   extremely     small.    But in the second, and especially in the
 third class, the    law of hours    was observed to  fail ;  and in the latter
 of these classes the      peculiar action of disturbances was very mani
fest, the tendency of such disturbances being to create very strong
earth-carrents at the moment of their occurrence ; and it is notice
able   that these earth-currents      were as often positive as negative.
    It  was remarked       by the author, that the very great strength of
those    earth -currents, which take place at the moments of disturb
ance, is    in favour of the theory of induction, since the peculiarity
of a disturbance        is not so much a very great as a very rapid and
abrupt     departure     of the magnet from the normal position ; and
since, on the theory of induction, the corresponding             earth-current
 will be due to abruptness of magnetic change, we thus obtain an
explanation why the currents which accompany disturbances are so
very    powerful, and also why these are as often positive as negative.
    With regard to the first class of earth-current observations, or
those which occurred during magnetic calm, the author believed
the   daily range indicated by these observations to be the induction
 effect  of the daily magnetic change, on which hypothesis the small
value    of the currents      for the night hours might be accounted for
by the     corresponding      fact that during these hours the magnetic
 change is    exceedingly small.

     In  the  course of investigations     which the author had     been led to
 make in connection         with  a Treatise on Natural Philosophy which
 he and      Professor    Tait  are  about to publish,    he met with some
  remarkable     theorems, which appear to be new and of considerable

importance.            As the details of the investigations                    will soon be pub
lished, a         very brief sketch only is given here.
     I. Twist of                          If
                             straight wire, of uniform section, have
                           a wire.             a
a side line of reference traced on its surface parallel to its axis ;
and if a perpendicular to this line from any point of the axis be
called a transverse,                the amount of torsion or twist of the wire,       when
bent into any form,                    may be determined              by the following con
struction     :   —
   Parallel to the tangent to the axis of the wire, at a point moving
along       it,
           let    radius of an unit sphere be drawn, cutting the
                       a
spherical          surface       in   a   curve.       From points       of this curve        draw
parallels to the transverses at the corresponding                              points of the   bar.
The excess of the change of direction from one point to the other
in the curve, above the increase of its inclination to the transverse,
is    equal to the twist in the corresponding                       part of the wire.
      From this some very curious consequences follow, of which one
is    as follows — If  wire be bent along any curve on a spherical
                       :         a
surface, so that                    side line of reference lies all along in                contact

with the sphere,                    acquires no twist         ;   so that when an apple       (sup
posed spherical)     peeled, there
                             is       no twist in the peel.
                                                       is

a geodetic line, its twist    at every point equal
                                           is       to the  tortuosity of
its axis.

       Given any material system at rest, and subjected to an
impulse of any given magnitude and in any specified direction, it
will move off          so as to take the greatest                  amount of kinetic        energy
which the specified impulse can give it.
     Cor.    If    a   set of material               points   be    struck    independently by
impulses, each given in amount,                         more kinetic energy          is   generated

   IV. In this brief note,          I shall not give any more of these trans
formations,        which really present no difficulty; but           I  shall show
the ready      applicability to physical questions of one or two of those
already obtained,        a property     of great importance,      as  it may now
be   asserted     that the next grand extensions of mathematical physics
will,   in all likelihood, be furnished by quaternions.

    Thomson has shown (Camb. & Dub. Math.                 Journal, ii. p. 62), that
the forces       produced    by given distributions of matter,          electricity,
magnetism,         or galvanic currents, can       be represented at every     point

may be useful          to give his analysis,         with some additions,       in   a
quaternion form, to show the              insight gained by the simplicity of
the present method.

that this         is    the vector-force                exerted by       a     small plane current at the

or pole of solenoid, at p. This expression, being
                  a                                 pure vector,                               a
denotes an elementary                   rotation caused by the distortion of the
solid, and        it     is   evident that the above value of er satisfies the equa
tions      (16)',        (17),      and the distortion                    is     therefore     producible          by
external forces.                   Thus the effect of an element of                            a    current on     a
magnetic particle                   is   expressed directly by the displacement, while
that      of   a        small      closed current              or magnet             is   represented        by   the
vector-axis             of the rotation caused                     by   the displacement.

It   is   evident that             a~    satisfies (16)', and that the right-hand side of
the above equation may be written

Hence the corresponding                                displacement            is   producible      by external
forces, and              <   <r>   is   the rotation           axis of the element at                    p, and is
seen as before to represent the vector-force                                        exerted on      a   particle of
magnetism at              p     by an element a of                 a    current at the origin.

       1.   On the Conservation          of Energy.      By Professor Tait.
                                       (Abstract.)
              (This Lecture    was given at the request   of the Council.)
      What Matter or Force may be, we have not as yet the slightest
 idea.       Matter is only known to us by the forces it exerts or resists.
 It is    possible that there may be but one species of ultimate parts
 (molecules or atoms ?)        of matter  ;  but in the present state of chemical
science,       it is more philosophical     to reason as    if the ultimate    parts
of the various elementary            bodies are distinct.      However    this may
he, a     particle     of hydrogen, oxygen, sodium, or gold, exerts certain
definite forces upon other particles            ; which   forces, we have every
reason      to believe, will remain for ever unchanged,             unless the so-
called element should at some future time be decomposed.
    Now, for such elementary particles, change of position (grouping)
or    motion (relative) is the only affection we can conceive ; and we
must endeavour to deduce, from the relation between forces and the
motions they produce,           all the phenomena of nature, except perhaps
some      of those exhibited in living structures.
      All that is necessary for such an inquiry has been most distinctly
 laid down by Newton in his Axiomata, and the Scholia appended
 to them.          A brief  resume of what Newton has there done will lead
  os easily      and naturally to the Conservation           of Energy — though
  stated for      visible  motions only, and without reference to the ener
  gies of heat,      electricity, &c.

     I.    The motion of              a body is       uniform          if no   force act on it.
     II.    Change of motion is proportional                             to the force producing                 it,
and takes place in the direction in which the force                                        is   exerted.
     From this            it   follows at once, that force                    is   measured by the rate
of   change          ofmotion        it   produces   ;    in other words, by the product of
the mass, and the acceleration of its velocity.
  This, combined with purely geometric ideas as to motion in the
abstract, leads directly to the parallelogram of forces, and through
it   to the subjects of the Statics and Kinetics of                                     a       single particle.
In    order to extend our investigations                                 to   a     body, or      a   system    of
bodies, we require the additional law,
     III.       To every action there                     is   an equal and opposite                   reaction.
     Newton shows that there                        are    t%oo   ways in which this action may
be measured, the                  third law being true for either.                              These lead to
two classes of important dynamical theorems.
     (a) Mutual                pressures, tensions              of rods and cords, attractions,
stresses in solids or liquids, &c. &c., form one class of Actions and
Reactions.                We have thus,             as immediate                                      " Conser
                                                                              consequences,
vation of Momentum," and                            " Conservation of Areas."                         From this
point of view,                  we    have also the general                        statement,      by what      is
commonly               called " D'Alembert's Principle,"                             of the equations           of
equilibrium and motion, and therefore the mathematical                                                     expres
sion of the circumstances of any dynamical problem.
  (6) But Newton goes farther, and points out another kind of action
and reaction, ruled by the third law.   His words are, — azstime-                                     si

but we also have as                  a    reaction, the resistance due to the acceleration

but now extended to all the phenomena of physical science) con

   It   would be easy to give the general investigation,                                   but for an
elementary        lecture like this a very simple example                           will suffice, —
the   case   of   a particle moving           in
                                   straight line, and acted on by
                                                   a                                                     a
force whose direction coincides with the line of motion.
   If s be    the space passed over in time                       t,   and v the velocity, geome
trical ideas lead      at once to
                                                       ds                                          /1N

   This is the ordinary equation of motion.
   But Newton's second form of action and reaction,                               as connected by
the third law, gives at once for the action of the force                                   F^,   and for
the reaction of the particle due to acceleration                             we have              multi-

124                   Proceedings     of the Royal     Society
expressing that the change of vis viva is measured by the amount
of work done by the force.        What is expended in work is therefore
stored    up   as   vis viva.     (This is given generally for a single
particle by Newton       ; Principia, Section VIII., Prop. XL.)
   A  simple case is that of a weight raised, or falling, in a vertical
line.    Here the work expended in raising it is so many foot
pounds, each being the work employed to raise one pound a foot
high.     And in fact, by the ordinary formulae for projectiles,
                                     ir=2gs,
                              or  — =mg.s=W.s,
or the vis viva acquired         by falling through a space        s,  is equal to
the work      lost in falling,     or required    to restore the body to its
original position.       Now, the raised weight, in virtue of its position,
has a power of doing work which it does not possess when lying
on the ground ; this is an example of what is called Potential
Energy.      As it loses this in falling, it gains an exact equivalent in
vis viva, which is what is called Kinetic Energy.             In this example
we see   that the sum of the potential and kinetic energies is constant ;
and the same is true in other common cases, such as the potential
energy of a drawn bow and the kinetic energy of the arrow, the
potential   energy of compressed air in the reservoir            of an air-gun
and the kinetic energy of the bullet, and so on.               It   is true even
in such    a case as the    potential energy of a distorted tuning-fork
and the kinetic energy of the sound it produces, if we include in
the latter the vis viva of the vibrations communicated              to surround
ing bodies.
   It  is easy to give a general         proof, that   if the particles of any
system act each on another with forces which are in the direction
of the line joining them, and dependent               on  the mutual distance
only, in such     a system tho sum      of the potential and kinetic       energies
cannot be altered except by external forces;        and therefore,    if the intro
ductory statements about matter        be true,  and physical   phenomena      such
as heat, electricity, &c., be referred to motion      of matter, there can be no
alteration   in   the  sum  of  the energies    of the universe. This is the
general statement of the Conservation of Energy.
   Prom this we at once deduce a proof of the impossibility of pro

curing perpetual motion (i.e., a machine which not only keeps up
its motion     but does external work) by means of any of the known
forces    of nature ; and trice verad, taking this impossibility for
granted,      we  may show that the forces exerted by two material
particles    on each other must be in the direction of the line joining
the two, and      must depend on their distance only.
    The first of the physical energies, distinct from visible motions,
which was shown to be
                                                        "
                                         to the law of conservation," was
                                subject
Heat.      Bacon, Locke, and others, long ago regarded heat in a
material body as a species of motion ; but it was not proved to be
so  till a comparatively recent period, when Davy showed it conclu
sively    by melting pieces of ice by rubbing them together in             an
enclosure      cooled    below   the  freezing point.     Davy says, "The
immediate cause of the phenomenon of Heat is motion, and the
laws    of its communication are the same           as the laws of the com
munication       of motion."      Take, in connection with this, Newton's
second     form of Action and Reaction, and we have the Dynamical
Theory      of Heat   ; requiring, of course, experimental data to connect
the    two forms of Energy quantitatively.           Rumford, by measuring
the    heat produced in boring cannon, and comparing it with the
work expended,         made a near approach to the value of the mechani
                                                                      " How
 cal   equivalent of heat— t.e., to an answer to the question,
 much work is required to produce a given amount of kinetic energy
 in the   form of heat?"          Other thinkers and experimenters made
 more    or less accurate and useful advances, but in a very small way,
 till  Joule, about twenty years ago, made the experimental             treat
 ment    of the subject his own. He showed by varied yet accordant
 experiments, that 772 foot pounds of mechanical energy are equi
 valent     to the additional kinetic energy which a pound of water
  must acquire to raise      its temperature from     60° P. to 61°  F.    He
 has extended       his experimental    work to others of the physical ener
 gies, and arrived      at  many most startling results, several of which
  1 intend to show to-night.
      The science of Thermodynamics,         in which Carnot and Clapeyron
  made great steps before the immateriality of heat was generally
 recognised, has, since Joule's experiments were made, received
 enormous        developments     from  Clausius,  Rankine, Thomson, and
 others; and Helmholz, in an admirable essay (Ueber die Erhaltung
     vol v.                                                         q

  126                  Proceedings     of the Royal   Society
  tier  Kraft) published in 1847, has extended most ingeniously the
  application of the principle of
                                         " conservation " through the whole
 range of physics,        bringing out, from the principles already stated
 in this discourse, the explanation of electrodynamic induction, &c.,
 besides various laws of transformation        of energy, already empirically
 determined from experiment.
     [The lecturer then performed an extensive series of experiments,
 involving transformations of various forms of energy, pointing out in
 each case the separate portions into which the original energy was
 broken up.       It  is not necessary to describe these experiments     here.]
     It  will be    seen   that  in all these experiments       heat has been
pointed     out as the ultimate        form taken by the original energy.
This is    a general law     of nature, — All  energy ultimately becomes heat.
Also heat,     by conduction,     radiation, or convection, tends ultimately
to be    uniformly diffused through the matter in the universe; and
when uniformly diffused, cannot be made available for the produc
tion of any other form of energy, since, for the transformation              of
heat into any other form of energy, bodies of different temperatures
are required.        Uniformly diffused heat, then, as far as we can see
at    present,   is the inevitable      ultimate transformation     of all the
energy, potential or kinetic, in the universe.
    [The lecturer went on to consider at some length the gravitation
theory of the origin of the sun's energy, and various connected
subjects, which are to a certain extent already popularised.]

                      Monday, 7th December 1863.
    Professor Innes, one of the Vice-Presidents, delivered the
                    following Opening Address : —
     Gentlemen, — The opening of our Session requires that shouldI
  lay before you the state and prospects of our Society, which     I hope
  may to some extent      be considered   the criteria of the state and
  prospects of the sciences which it cultivates.
     The Society has lost since the commencement of last Session by
  death, six Fellows, viz., — Robert Allan, Esq., Beriah Botfield, Esq.,
  Dr James Keith, Dr David Boswell Reid, Professor Connell of
  St Andrews,   Professor Mitscherlich of Berlin   ; and by resignation,
 two, the Rev. G.   V. Faithfull and D. R. Hay, Esq.
    In  room of whom the Society has elected twenty-five new Fellows,
 viz., — Professor Blackie, William Brand, Esq., W.S., Robert Camp
 bell, Esq., advocate, Dr Hugh F. C. Cleghorn, India, Charles
 Cowan, Esq., W. Dittmar, Esq., Dr J. Matthews Duncan, the
 Right Hon. Lord Dunfermline, Professor Everett, Nova Scotia,
 James Hannay, Esq., William Jameson, Esq., India, Hon. Lord
 Jerviswoode, Charles Lawson, Esq., Hon. G. Waldegrave Leslie,
 G. R. Maitland, Esq., W.S., Edward Meldrum, Esq., Rev. Dr
 Nesbit, Hon. Lord Ormidale,       David Page, Esq., Dr A. Peddie,
 James Sanderson, Esq., Deputy- Inspector of Hospitals, Dr John
 A. Smith, Dr Murray Thomson, Dr        J. G. Wilson, Dr John Young.
                                        —
    Our roll, therefore, stands thus : The number of Fellows in
 1862 was 258, of which we have lost by death 6, by resignation 2 = 8,
leaving 250.      To which add the new Fellows,         25, making the
whole number of the Fellows of our Society 275, a larger number
than has appeared on the list for many years.
    I am  enabled, chiefly through the active kindness of our Secre
taries, to offer a few notices of the members we have lost, during
the past Session.
    Robert   Allan, son of  Mr Thomas Allan,    a banker  in Edinburgh,
a  Fellow of the Society, and for many years Curator of its Museum
and Library, and well known as an early and successful collector of a
fine cabinet of minerals, was born in 1806, and educated at the High

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1863-64.                           131
School and University of Edinburgh. He inherited his father's taste
 for minerals, and while still a youth followed out the study in
 extended travels in company with Professor Haidinger, who intro
 duced him to the acquaintance and to the cabinets of all the chief
 foreign mineralogists- — among others, Berzelius and Mitscherlich.
     Mr Allan passed advocate in 1 829, but never practised, and was
 admitted a Fellow of this Society in 1832.           He was also a member
 of the  Geological Society of London.
     Mr Allan published in 1834       a Manual of Mineralogy, the classi
 fication founded on the external          character    or natural   historical
 arrangement.
    In  1837 he edited a fourth edition         of " Phillips'  Mineralogy,"
 in which   he added notices    of 150 new minerals.
    On his return from an excursion to the volcanic district of            Italy
 and Sicily,  Mr Allan presented to this Society          a set of specimens
 of volcanic    rocks of the Lipari      Isles, with    a descriptive   notice,
 an abstract of which      is in our Transactions,        of date 16th Jan
 uary 1831.
    He communicated      an account     of a visit to the Geysers and Hecla
 to the British Association at Glasgow, in 1855.
    Mr Allan died in consequence of        a  fall in his garden.
    Beriah Botfield was of        a Shropshire      family, in which county
 his grandfather,    Thomas      Botfield,   made his large fortune         as a
 manager and lessee of the Dawlay Collieries.             Thomas's third son
inherited Norton Hall, near Daventry, in Northamptonshire,                   and
lived the life of  an English sporting squire.        He married Charlotte,
daughter of William Withering, M.D., F.R.S., the author of " The
Botanical Arrangement of British Plants."             The only child of that
marriage    was Beriah,    the subject of the present notice, who, in
addition   to his father's  property, inherited the estates       of both his
uncles, and had become before his death a man of very large fortune.
    Beriah was born 5th March 1807, and succeeded his father in          1  813.
He was educated at Harrow and Christ Church, where                    he took
his Bachelor's degree in     1 828.
    After leaving Oxford he made a tour in the Highlands of Scot
land, a journal of which he printed for private circulation, —printed
at  Norton Hall,    1830, 12mo.

132                  Proceedings       of the Royal     Society
    He was High Sheriff of Northamptonshire in 1831,
    In  1840 he was elected Member for Ludlow, and again in 1841.
    In  1847 he was beaten by the          Whig candidate.
    In  1857 he was solicited to stand again, and he sat in              Parlia
ment for Ludlow for the rest of his life.
     Mr Botfield was          a member    of the Royal Society of London,
the Royal Geographical            Society, Royal Institution, Society   of Arts,
of the Antiquaries of London, Scotland,                and Copenhagen,    of the
Royal Irish Academy, l'lnstitut d'Afrique, and of all the principal
 Societies in the Kingdom, and of a great number of literary Clubs, —
as the Roxburghe,            Bannatyne,   Maitland, Spalding, Surtees,Abbots-
 ford,   Camden,        Percy, iElfric, Hakluyt, Cheetham ; to most of
 which he gave valuable contributions,              his part being generally to
 defray the expense.
     In  addition to these, and some smaller tracts printed for private
 circulation, Mr Botfield published " Notes on the Cathedral
 Libraries of England," from a personal examination, 1849 ; '' Pre
 faces to the    First Editions of the Greek and Roman Classics, and of
 the Sacred Scriptures,"          1861.   Large 4to.
     Another work, for which he was making collections                 when he
 died, and which would have been of great interest and value, was
 intended to illustrate the history of the old monastic libraries of
 England.       A   collection of the extant catalogues and inventories of
  these was already in type, to which he meant to add the catalogues
  of other Middle Age libraries.               His collections, made for these
  objects will,   it   is   feared, be lost to the world by his death.        He
  had previously edited (in 1 838), for the Surtees Society, catalogues
  of the Library of Durham Cathedral, at various periods.
      In  1858,  Mr Botfield printed, for private circulation, Stemmata
  Botevilliana,      a    large volume     illustrating the descent and anti
  quities of all the Bottevilles, Thynnes, and Botfields.
      He was    a  liberal collector of pictures, and       was also known   as a
   zealous book-hunter.
      Mr Botfield married Isabella, daughter of Sir Baldwin Leighton,
   Bart., but left no family        ; and   has entailed a considerable part of
   his property on the second son of the Marquis of Bath, in respect
   of a very old but perhaps real connexion between his family and
   the Thynnes.

                       of Edinburgh,      Session 1863-64.                    133
     Jambs    Keith, second son of William Keith of Corstorphine Hill,
accountant in Edinburgh, was born 29th November                    1783, and was
educated      at the    High School and University of Edinburgh.               He
was apprentice         to Messrs    Bell, Wardrope, and Russell; went to
London       in   1804,  and attended the London Hospital and Guy's.
Was surgeon          of the Berwickshire Militia for two or three years,
which he resigned on entering into partnership                 with Dr Andrew
Wardrope,        which connection       terminated     by Dr Wardrope's     death
in 1822.
    Mr Keith took the degree of M.D. in the University of Edin
burgh in 1804, and he became a Fellow of the College of Surgeons
in 1810.        He   was   physician   to the Deaf and Dumb Institution for
many years.          From the extreme shyness of his disposition, his
worth and ability were known only to a limited circle of intimate
 friends.      He died 12th May 1863. His widow and two sons sur
 vive — William Alexander, M.A. Oxon., and Charles Maitland.
     David Boswell Reid was the second son of Dr Peter Reid, phy
 sician in Edinburgh.          His mother, Christian Arnot,        was the eldest
 daughter      of Hugo Arnot of Balcormo,              advocate   and antiquary,
 well known to the last generation               by his book on the history of
 Edinburgh and his collection of Scotch criminal trials — and per
 haps    still better by the extraordinary         attenuated, almost skeleton,
 figure of the old gentleman             preserved    to us in Kay's Portraits.
  Dr Peter    Eeid (whose mother was          a Boswell  of the Balmuto family)
  was   the editor of Dr Cullen's
                                             " First Lines of the Practice of
  Physic,"      1802.     A  new edition      was  published,   with supplemen
  tary notes, in 1810.        He   was  also the author of a little duodecimo
  volume, entitled "Letters on the Study of Medicine and on the Medi
  cal Character,      addressed to a Student," Edin., 1809.           Besides the
  subject of my present notice,           Dr Peter Reid had two         sons, — Dr
  William,      a lecturer  in Edinburgh on the practice of Medicine, and
   Dr Hugo, well known as the author of several popular works, the
   last of which is a modest and temperate memoir of his distin
   guished brother, to which        I beg   to acknowledge     my obligation.
      David Boswell Reid was educated at the              High School and Uni
   versity of Edinburgh.         At the former, Mr Pillans, the rector, has
   mentioned him as
                            " among the head boys of the Rector's           class."

 134              Proceedings        of the Royal     Society
While    a medical    student he became a member of the Royal Medi
cal Society, of which he was chosen senior president in 1826-27,            his
junior being James Kay, now Sir James Kay Shuttleworth.
    In 1827, Mr David Reid commenced a course of practical che
mistry,    which was very useful and very popular.                He aimed at
enabling each student to familiarise himself, by experiments made
under the directions of a teacher, with the properties of the chief
chemical substances, and the phenomena              attending   their action on
each other.
    After much approval in his extra-mural lecture-room, he joined
Dr Hope in the College, and was again quite successful in the object
of his course.    But the Professor and Assistant had some misunder
 standings, which led      Mr Reid to leave the College, and renew his
independent lectures, which were highly appreciated — attended
by all classes, — the young ambitious student, — the veteran philoso
pher and man of science, — the man of intelligence feeling the
 want of science.      On his benches met         Dr Chalmers and Sir John
 Leslie, Professors George Joseph Bell and Pillans, Dean Ramsay
 and   Mr Combe.
     After the burning of the Houses of Parliament, and in contem
 plation of a new building, when a committee of the Commons was
 inquiring on the subject of its ventilation and acoustics, Dr Reid
 was examined as a witness, from having devoted much attention
 to those subjects, and having shown excellent examples of his skill,
 first in his own lecture-room,        and, later, in the great      temporary
 edifice, erected 15th September 1834, in the           High School ground,
 for the Edinburgh dinner to Lord Grey, at which 2768 persons
were present, and 240 ladies in the gallery, and each individual
  speaker was distinctly heard.*
     The result of his examination        was, that   Dr Reid was employed
to direct the ventilation and acoustics of the temporary House of
 Commons in 1836.         It  is not pretended that his plans gave uni
versal satisfaction     to the 700 members, each of whom had a              dif
 ferent   notion, and of course a peculiar constitution of body to be
suited.    But, after ten years' experience, in 1846,         a fair committee
of the House reported       as  to " the great improvement effected," and
 " concurred in the
                        general opinion in its favour."
         * The Pavilion   was 113 feot  in length by 101 feet in breadth.

     In  1840   arrangements were made for Dr Reid settling in London,
 and, while      taking charge of ventilating the temporary House of
 Commons,        superintending also the ventilation of the new build
 ing then in progress.          This brought Dr Reid necessarily into close
contact     with the architect of the new palace, Mr Barry, and unfor
 tunately they       did not agree.     The difference got worse and worse,
till in 1845 they were no longer on speaking              terms, and every de
tail of such extensive          operations had to be settled by correspond
ence, — a state      of things which could not        be allowed to last.   The
quarrel broke out in some strong expressions of Dr Reid, — a prose
cution for libel by Mr Barry, — a pretty general attack on Dr Reid
by    the  public press,      and a Reply by him to " The Times" news
paper    [1845-47].
    In   1852 a negotiation        was entered into, by which the Govern
ment      proposed     to secure    Dr Reid's services permanently,       and to
throw the       ventilation of the whole buildings of the Houses under
his charge, — one part of which, the House of Lords, had hitherto
                                                                         " these
been managed           by Mr Barry on a different system, — but
negotiations        were abruptly broken       off."    In  fact, Dr Reid was
turned off,     after sixteen years successful service, and, as his brother
tells us,
              " a  small sum was given to him        as some compensation     for
the loss    which he had sustained.         His friends who knew his whole
career, and       the proceedings connected with his removal to Loudon,
to take    the charge      of ventilating the Houses of Parliament, were of
opinion     that the sum awarded was totally inadequate to compensate
for the    sacrifices he had made."
    Dr Reid went to         New York in 1855.        He delivered lectures in
the    Smithsonian        Institution  there, and at Boston.      In the begin
 ning of     this year (1863), he received the appointment of Inspector
 of   Military Hospitals, but soon after, while engaged in an official
journey, he died suddenly at          Washington, on 5th April 1863.
    Dr Beid's system          of ventilating great buildings, where crowds
 habitually assembled, consisted in forcing in a current of air by
 means of a powerful engine — the air being previously               washed to
 free it from      dust and to give     it the requisite moisture.      Some of
 bis experiences       are curious.
     "
       The house is heated to 62° before        it is opened, and maintained
 ln general at a                      between 63° and 70°, according to the
                        temperature

136              Proceedings      of the Royal Society
velocity with which the air is permitted to pass through the house.
This velocity is necessarily regulated by the numbers present,
the temperature to which the air can be reduced in warm weather,
and the amount of moisture which it may contain when the quan
tity is excessive.   Some members are much           more affected      by an
excess or deficiency of moisture than by alterations of temperature.
In   extremely warm weather, by increasing       the velocity, air even at
75° may be rendered cool and pleasant to the        feelings."
    He  goes  on to say — " The temperature       may always be advan
tageously increased and the velocity diminished before the usual
dinner hour.     After dinner, other circumstances        being the same,
the temperature should be diminished,         the velocity increased,     and
the amount of moisture       in the air reduced.     During late debates,
as  they advance to two, three, four, or five in the morning, the tem
perature should be gradually increased as the constitution becomes
more exhausted, except in cases where the excitement is extreme."
    Next to the Houses of Parliament, Dr Reid's greatest and most
successful undertaking of ventilation was the St George's Hall at
Liverpool, in which immense building, on       some occasions,    there have
 been as many as 4500 persons for about ten hours          ;  the air during
 all that time having been supplied to all that multitude in a pure
 state, and in a comfortable and agreeable condition         as to tempera
 ture and moisture.
    Dr Reid superintended      while in this country the arrangements
 for ventilating the royal yacht, " The Victoria and Albert," and
 the steamships used in the expedition to the Niger, in both in
 stances to the entire satisfaction   of his employers   ;   and since going
 to America, he was   employed in the ventilation of      a Russian   frigate,

 the Admiralty     Court,  and author    of  a  well known work on the
  Law of Scotland     respecting   Tithes, entered the High School of
  Edinburgh in 1804, and the University of Edinburgh                in 1808,
 where he studied under Playfair, Leslie, Dugald Stewart, and Hope.
  From Edinburgh Mr Connell went to Glasgow College, where he
  studied under Jardine and Young, and, having obtained a Snell
  exhibition, went to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1812.

      la  1817  Mr Connell     passed    advocate at the Scotch Bar, but he
  bad from     boyhood a remarkable turn for science, especially botany
  and chemistry,     and he ultimately devoted himself exclusively to
  the latter   science.
     In  1840 he    was presented to the Chair of Chemistry in the         Uni
  versity  of St Andrews.
    In   1843   Mr Connell was candidate for the Chemistry Chair at
  Edinburgh, vacant by the death of Dr Hope, and though not suc
 cessful,   produced a collection of testimonials of the highest charac
 ter.     Most   of these were the more worthy of attention              as  not
 made for     the occasion and so in some degree influenced          by private
 friendship.      They   are  for the most part notices in the published
 works     of eminent chemists and in scientific journals, of Mr
 Connell's     chemical    labours,   and the papers in which these were
 announced and described.
    Having failed in this object           of his ambition, Mr Connell con
tinued to study and teach          his favourite   science at St Andrews     till
1856,    when the fracture of a limb, and its effects upon a constitu
tion already       long enfeebled, completely incapacitated           him from
active duty.
    Mr Connell became a member of this Society in 1829, from which
time till 1843 he contributed to the Transactions, or published in
the pages       of the "Edinburgh Philosophical Journal," memoirs to
the    number of 29.
    His chief merit lay in his           skill and unrivalled accuracy      as a
mineral analyst.         To him we are indebted for several new mineral
species — for the discovery in the minerals Brewsterite and Harmo-
tome of the earth barytes in combination                with silicic acid — that
earth     previously having         been    found   combined    only with the
sulphuric and carbonic acids           ;  while his ascertaining the constitu
tion    of the mineral Greenockite,           on one grain of the substance,
displayed      a dexterity seldom     if ever  surpassed.
    Mr Connell also engaged in somewhat more ambitious researches
on the voltaic decompositions of alcohol, ether, and other liquids, and
has presented us        with an instrument for ascertaining the dew point,
superior     in several respects to that generally used.
    Mr Connell was of       a very retiring nature, modest, gentlemanly, and
gentle in     disposition.     He expired peacefully on 31st of October last.

   Eilaed Mitscheruch, born 7th January 1794, at Neurede, in
the Grand Duchy of Oldenburgh,            where his father was a minister
of the Lutheran Church, was educated at Heidelberg and Paris,
and studied afterwards at Gottingen. His first objects of study
were language       and ethnology.      Later in life he devoted himself
more    to natural science, and especially       chemistry.    He assisted
Berzelius at Stockholm for some years.
   In 1821 he was appointed Professor of Chemistry in the Univer
sity of Berlin, and attached to the Friedrich          Wilhelm     Institut.
His lectures      were held     in   high  estimation,  and   attended    by
numerous classes of students.
   In  1828 he was elected an Honorary Member of this Society, and
in 1829 was awarded a Medal by the Royal Society of London for
his discourses " regarding the laws of crystallization and the pro
perties of crystals."
   In 1852 Mitscherlich was elected an Associate Member of the
Institute of France. His great European reputation is founded on
his studies on crystallization and some ingenious adaptations of in
struments for practical chemistry.          His text-book — Lehrbnch der
Chemie — has gone through a great many editions.
   Mr Mitscherlich died in the present year.
   His experiments and disquisitions tended to establish the rule
that bodies crystallizing in the same shape (isomorphous)           have an
analogous chemical composition — throwing great light on chemical
classification,   and giving     us one of the greatest     generalizations
(after the Atomic theory) which chemistry has gained by the re
searches of philosophers.
   When     I  have laid before you these slender memorials of our de
ceased brethren,     I may claim to have discharged the real duty of my
office to-night.     If indeed I were worthy to fill the chair in which
your favour has placed me, — if I had, like some of our distinguished
Fellows,    a knowledge    of all science, or even a special acquaintance
with any    one, — it would be my    duty to submit to you a survey, or at
least some outline, of the progress of science among us and among
our neighbours.      But for such a task you know me to be ill qualified.   I
should not venture to speak in the language of science anywhere, and
least of all in the presence of the men whom I now see around me.

    There are subjects, however, in which scientific men and men of
no science feel an equal interest — which must engage the attention
of every person of common intelligence.
     Among these is the great step recently made in African geo
graphy — the discovery of the head of the Nile. No other geogra
phical discovery can ever compare with this. It is not the solution
of a puzzle in the Geographical Society. It is removing the
" Impossible" — the very type of impossibilities — from our books. It
is opening to the whole world the mystery which was                 a mystery
even to the initiated.      Poets have lost a topic    !   What philosophers
and historians guessed and speculated about, is now written down
 plain on the map. That is now clear which has been wondered at
since men began to ask the meaning of anything.                  We have lost
 the oldest subject of curiosity in the world I
     A grave, prosaic mind loses its equanimity,         and gives way to the
 charm of romance         at the   thought of the veil being raised that
 has for so many thousands of years covered the head of the great
 mysterious river which was worshipped of old — not more for its
 beneficent   overflowings,    regular as the seasons,     yet unaccountable,
 than because of its unknown, unapproachable source.
     I do not mean that the facts which our travellers have brought
 to light run counter to the conclusions of former geographers.              On
 the contrary,    I  think the body of history        on the one hand,      the
 speculations   of science on the other, had prepared the world for
 such a discovery.      Glancing at the ancient,        I mean the classical
 authorities, without arraying them before you, I may say that among
 innumerable fables and          much   unphilosophical reasoning,        they
 almost concur in giving the       Nile its source in    a mighty lake — some
 say two immense lakes — fed by periodical rains, — fed also, say        some,
 by subterraneous streams flowing from the west (these subterraneous
  rivers were favourites with the wonder-loving naturalists of old).
  This great lake   was  further believed   to lie at the foot of lofty, snow-
  covered mountains, named the Mountains of the Moon.               Herodotus
  indeed demurs to the snow.         The Reservoir     Lakes become immea
  surable marshes in some of the accounts.          Indeed    I should  despair
  of producing   a catena   of witnesses for any single point of the state
  ment  ; but such   as I  have described was nearly the mind of ancient
  Greece and Rome, speaking on the information obtained in Egypt.

140               Proceedings of the Royal Society
    It is more remarkable to find a similar shadow of the truth       from
a different quarter, and perhaps of an earlier date.        The ancient
inhabitants of India seem to have felt the same interest, and to
have had an equal glimmering of the course of the Nile.        In  a  -well-
known paper by Mr Wilford, in the Asiatic Researches, we have a
sort of abstract of the ancient    Indian belief concerning the      Nile,
drawn from the Puranas and other Hindu or Sanscrit books.
    The name of the river in those most ancient books is             Kali,
 black.    (Though Homer names the river Aegyptus, it was known           to
 ancient Greeks as MtXas.)     According to the same authorities, that
 famous and holy river takes its rise from the lake of the gods,
 thence named Amara or Deva, Sarovera in the region of         Sharma or
 Sharmasthan,    between the mountains of Ajagara and Sitanta,          part
 of Soma-giri,   or the Mountains of the Moon, the country           round
 the lake being called Chandristhan or Moon-land.           The   Hindus
 believed in a range of snow-covered hills in Africa.
     From thence the Kali flows into the marshes of the Padma-van,
 and through the Nishada Mountains into the land of Barbara                  ;
 whence it passes through the mountains of Hemacata         ; then   enter
 ing the forests of Tapas (or Thebais) it runs into Kantaka-desa, or
  Mitha-sthan, and through the woods emphatically named Aranya
  and Atavi into Sanchabdhi    (or our Mediterranean).
     From the country    of Pushpaversha, it received     the Nanda or
  Nile of Abyssinia, the Asthimati or smaller Krishna, which, is the
  Takazzi or little Abay, and the Sanchanaga or Mareb.
     The Ajagara Mountains, which run parallel to the eastern        shores
  of Africa, have at present the name of Lupata, or the back-hone of
  the world.    Those of Sitanta are the range which lies west of the
  lake Zamhre or Zaire, words not improbably     corrupted from     Amara
  or Sura.    This Lake of the Gods is believed to    be a vast  reservoir
  which, through visible or hidden channels, supplies all the         rivers
  of the country.
     The Hindus, for mythological purposes (says Mr         Wilford), are
  fond of supposing subterranean communications       between lakes and
  rivers, and the Greeks, we know, had the same leaning.
      We really had made little progress beyond these ancient guesses,
  till in the year 1858 Captains Speke and Burton saw and sailed
   upon the great lake Tanganyika,      600 miles    from    the  coast    at

                             of Edinburgh,      Session 1863-64.                               141
Zanzibar.           The lake is narrow, but 300 miles long, and 1800 feet
above the         level of the sea.        Very soon after, Captain Speke alone
had the       glory to see         and bear witness to the great inland sea which
he has      named Victoria.             Having only         seen    this mighty lake, and
being obliged to leave               it unexplored, Captain Speke made haste to
retnm to          it,   and this time in company with his old comrade and
brother-in-arms           Captain Grant, and through toils and dangers
which men           like these love almost for their own sake, they, together,
reached          in 1861 the Victoria Lake, which Speke had discovered
three years         earlier.
 It    happened (and such coincidences are frequent in science) that
at   the very time when Speke and Grant were fixing the bearings
and   heights of the great lake and its mountains, Baron von Decken
and    Mr Thornton measured and estimated the altitude of Kilima
Nearo, one          of  mountain range to the eastward of our travellers'
                         a
route,      at   20,000 feet, while the snow line descended below 16,000.
     At present our information                 is   necessarily       meagre, but on the
testimony          of these two veteran travellers, furnished                   as    they were
with instruments               for observation, we have some actual certainty,
and room          for infinite speculation.
     The Victoria Sea of fresh water                 is   about 150 miles square.              The
equator          line runs through       it,   though nearer its north shore.                    Its
waters are 3563 feet above the sea level.                      It   is   skirted,    if not   quite
surrounded,  by ranges of mountains of 10,000 feet high. Without
farther evidence, independent even of the high authority of Captain
Speke's opinion, we receive as certain that in the Victoria great
lake     is   tho source, or rather the great reservoir of the Nile, for of
course        the lake        is   fed by numerous         streams, in fact by         a   stream
from every        valley among the surrounding mountains, and then                                it
follows       that the White Nile, not the Blue Nile as Bruce believed,
is    the   chief of the two streams that join at Kartom, lat.                        15° 30'.
      Thus was the mystery cleared up that had defeated the ingenuity
and      enterprise of philosophers            and travellers,         of kings and        Caesars,
since the         days of Herodotus.
      Captain Speke  thinks very highly of the country he has explored
 in   a   commercial and agricultural view.   He found the people not
 all savage, but              capable of intelligent        interest      and quite awake to
 kindness and             friendship.     But the country            is   everywhere          thinly

142                Proceedings      of the Royal     Society
peopled, and productive much beyond the wants of the population.
Along the equator, at heights varying from 6000 to 12,000 feet, the
travellers found a delicious climate, with abundance of water, and no
excessive heat, full of cattle and corn.        In  the kingdom of    Karagwe
(lat.  1° 4ff, elevation  5100 feet), the temperature        for five months
ranged from 60° to 70° at       9 morning.     From what they could leam
of the country to the westward of the lake, it preserves the same
character for several hundred miles, and              I  know that Captain
Speke believes there is a continuance          of that which he calls the
Fertile Zone almost to the coast of the Atlantic.               He tells his
friends he has "discovered       a great fertile zone there, caused      princi
pally by the Mountains of the Moon, situated close to th$ equator,
in the midst of the continent of Africa.               These are great rain
condensers.      Round them are the sources of several rivers, the Nile
on one side, the Tanganyika and the Congo on the other.                     The
rains falling all round make that a       fertile zone — the   most   fertile in
the world.      There is nothing in India or China to equal         it."
    It is in that direction the indefatigable     traveller proposes to   make
his next expedition, and let us hope that in two years more we shall
welcome Captain Speke returning from the mouths of the Congo.
    I know    not whether to congratulate       or condole with the     Society
upon another advance in science, or whether that is to be called an
advance which some consider a double trespass, a breaking down of
the boundaries between geology and archaeology, and overleaping              the
ancient landmarks which divided natural science from sacred history.
    Certain well-known discoveries of hand-shaped weapons and
implements, found along with the remains of some extinct animals,
in undisturbed     beds  of a very ancient alluvial deposit both in     France
and in England, led the antiquary,         whose department is      limited to
the human period, to seek to extend that period into what had
 hitherto been the exclusive province of the geologist ; and the
geologist again, driven to admit that these flint spear-points have
been shaped by man's hand, and used upon (or among) the Elephas
primigenius, the Rhinoceros, and other extinct animals whose teeth
and bones now bear them company, has to seek for an extension                 of
 the period hitherto     allotted  for the operations and deposits which
 the race of man has witnessed.

      This only brought           out more palpably what geologists             had for
some time         taught — had taught indeed almost             as   early   as geology
took the      dimensions of a         science — that    the globe itself was im
measurably older than the age assigned                 for man.
   That     period — the     creation of man — the       age   of man on the globe —
had been      early, and nearly unanimously fixed, by calculations based
upon the data           afforded by the Mosaic books.
   Such      calculations        were necessarily      more     or less conjectural,
founded      on    interpretations       of archaic forms of language,          and of
words     which might have different meanings.                  Numbers and figures
were to be     read in varying manuscripts,            often from faulty copies          ;
and    although great men like Newton had satisfied themselves that
the received       age of the world and its inhabitants was the true one,
new facts,        of a science       unknown to Newton, had shaken that
opinion, and       it seemed probable that the Biblical scholar, the stu
dent     of sacred history, in the view of geological facts, would, in the
first place,      abandon the position        that the    age   of the creation, the
antiquity     of the earth, was to be determined by the interpretation
of the Mosaical books     ; and, secondly, that he would not shut his eyes
to new       evidence offered upon the questions, whether the Mosaical
books     intended to aflSnn the age of man upon the globe, and whether
the    interpreters of those books had accurately and precisely                     and
definitely ascertained their meaning and intention in that matter.
  I    should perhaps do better in using the terms of the latest
authority on this subject, which comes with "Oxford" on its title
page to vouch its orthodoxy, and with the sound sense of our friend
Dr Hannah to commend it to our acceptance : — *
  "
       It is surely mere misapprehension               to suppose that the reve
lation    with which Moses            was   really entrusted could traverse the
path     of the     modern        geologist, or contain any thing that would
either      confirm      or contradict      his readings of those buried rocks.
From whichever            side the error comes, we are bound to shake our
selves free       from     it,   not by saying with some that God cared not
though      His instruments should make mistakes on scientific subjects,
hut    by   pointing out that there can           be no error        where there   is   no
assertion,        and    thatpurely theological revelation contains
                                 a                                                      no
assertion     which falls within the proper sphere of science."

saical scholar,    both earnest for truth, would         have come to some
understanding,     not surely to conceal or shut out the truth, but to
give each    full license to inquire and experiment, and to draw all
legitimate   inferences from facts discovered        ; for after all, the dis
putes between theologians and geologists relate rather to inferences
from facts than to the reality of the facts themselves.             The theo
logian   infers  certain  truths from the words of the first chapter of
Genesis   ; the geologist infers certain notions from what he sees in
an open quarry.       The inferences     are mutually contradictory ; but
as the theologian and the geologist are both capable of drawing
false inferences, such inferences may be contradictory and neither
may be "true.      A  new light on the meaning          of the word    "Day"
in the Mosaic language might end the controversy.; so might some
evidence that the best instances of hand-formed flint implements
found in ancient drift were fictitious and fraudulent.
   We must suppose that a candid student of the Divine books will
take what help is in his power for explaining their difficulties, and,
be sure, he will not neglect the testimony of the rocks — the history
of creation written in other letters but by the same Author.              So a
candid geologist, who reflects that the purpose of Moses was clearly
not to teach natural philosophy, but to inculcate and enforce the
worship of the true God,     will acknowledge that the order of creation
given in Genesis     does agree  marvellously with the inverse order of
the fossils actually found — plants, marine or aquatic animals, birds,
mammals, man.
   I  say these disputants     might have come to terms — explaining
the Scripture history of the creation         by the help of a careful and
reverent study of the created universe.             But a third party has
lately rushed among the combatants, and now fight with two-edged
weapons.      These are theologians     too — at least they are churchmen,
and Hebraists,     and mighty arithmeticians       ;   but, with a    singular
view of their duty to their Church, they cavil at the foundations of
its history and doctrine, and think       it necessary to tell the world    so.
These critics insist, that no interpretation, construing of a phrase,
word, or numeral of the Mosaical books shall be admitted — that all
shall stand or fall together      ;  and then, having picked         out some
words,    especially   some numbers, which they judge erroneous             —

                        of Edinburgh,       Session 1863-64.                 145
 though     not     affecting a single point of doctrine        or morals, or the
 essentials    of history — they say the books ascribed to Moses              are
devoid of      authority, and must       be abandoned     !
    That is not the way in which we are accustomed to read any
ancient      history    ;  and, though    different  canons are used for criti
cising the       inspired writers from those applied to other historians,
yet, as to     the mere text, the books of Moses are entitled             beyond
others to a      fair and liberal construction,       as the most ancient books
in the world, and as          having passed through an infinite number of
transcriptions and translations.
   But    I must      declare my entire concurrence with       Dr Hannah, that
" it  is a dangerous         and mistaken      policy to raise these disputes to
adventitious importance,            by treating    them as though they neces
sarily   involved the issue of our highest interests."
    For the persons of tender conscience, who feel themselves con
strained
             "  to build up those scattered fragments of difficulty into a
coherent edifice         of doubt," they would themselves surely feel easier,
as  it would be        a relief to the world, who are judging in the quarrel,
if  they could        cease   to be members of a Church which founds so
confidently on the Mosaical history.               They would assail with more
satisfaction       if they had not promised to defend.
    For the geologist, if my voice were wanting to encourage him,
 I would bid him go forward, cautiously,                 reverently, yet without
fear.     Let him test the evidence with all care before publishing             a
 discovery.         He must consider he has everything to prove, and he
 should     assert nothing without evidence, and take nothing for
 granted.       We want proof of the antiquity of the Drift-deposit, and
of the      fossils contained in it belonging to the extinct animals
 named.       We want proof that the flints are hand-wrought,            and not
 chipped      accidentally in the rolling drift.           Much more,   we desire
 proof that they           were found there, and not placed to be found by
 some cunning quarryman.              It  is not only the flint instrument    but
 its manufacture,         its chipping into shape, that must be tested. la
 the fracture       of the flint such that it might have been made many
 thousand years ago ?
     Farther, the geologist should publish to the world the evidence
  of his facts    ;  for the inquiry is one that concerns the public, and in
     vol.  v.                                                         T

  146              Proceedings    of the Royal        Society
 which the public take an interest.           But why should      I  intrude my
 advice upon men who have shown they know well what is required
 at their hands in a momentous inquiry ? Nine of the most eminent
 geologists   of France and England met in friendly               conference      at
 Paris, and, later, at Abbeville, to compare specimens, to test the
 evidence, to do everything for ascertaining the truth ; and they
 published the   proci!s-verbal of their      proceedings    in the " Natural
 History Review" of last August, with the sanction of Dr              Falconer's
 name, and others equally well known.          It seems  hardly to be    doubted,
 that numerous frauds have been        perpetrated upon the naturalists.
 When specimens      are well paid for, they become         plentiful,    both in
 England and in France, but there may          be means of detecting       the im
positions, and these means our geologists           are  using with all        care.
The iron horse-shoe, lately put forth among the primeval               relics, has
been, as   I understand,  withdrawn    ;    the bones of elephant and other
animals, bearing marks of human            hands, are not yet accepted           by
these naturalists.     As to the Abbeville jaw-bone          of  a man, whose
jaw must have     ceased chewing    long before the flood,          there    is but
one opinion in England, which        I am informed by Mr Evans is also
                              —
gaining ground in France that the whole thing was an impudent
imposition.     Mr Prestwich, who was once a believer, published his
recantation in the last Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society.
    It  may be permitted    me, perhaps, as one        of the public,     to offer
ono more advice to the naturalist.            Ho must take care not            only
that his reasoning is logical,    his inferences        cautious and careful,
but he will do well to avoid even the appearance of disputing for
victory.    Science has no enemies       if  its votaries do not raise        them
up by indiscretion    and intemperance.
    I  have to apologise for occupying so much of your time, and for
venturing rashly beyond the boundaries of my own line of                 study.

   The following Communications were read : —
1. On the Morphological Relationships of the Molluscoida
   and Coelenterata and of their leading members, inter se.
   By John Denis Macdonald, B.N., F.E.S., Surgeon of
   H.M.S. "Icarus." Communicated by Professor Maclagan.
2. On the      External Anatomy of a New Mediterranean
   Pteropod. By John Denis Macdonald, E.N. Communi
   cated by Professor Maclagan.
3. On the   Limits of our Knowledge respecting the Theory of
                Parallels.    By Professor Kelland.
   The Author has in this paper traced to its consequences the

156             Proceedings      of the Royal     Society, 1863-64.
                      if it  were an axiom, of the proposition
                                                                      " That the
assumption, us
angles of a triangle are together less than two right angles."                The
results as regards the theory of parallels are such as to imply that
such lines would have most of the properties                of equal circles ex
terior    to one another.
    Professor      Tait reminded the Society that, at the close of last
session, he and Balfour Stewart, F.R.S., of the Kew Observatory, had
deposited with         the Secretary a sealed packet containing the coin
cident results of certain           investigations which they had separately
carried on from totally distinct points of view, and which appeared
to lead to a new principle in Natural Philosophy.
    Experimental attempts at verifications of this principle have
since been made by them in various ways, and others are in pro
gress.        Meanwhile, the authors desire to put on record that it
appears probable, from their experiments, that the viscosity,               &c, of
air   are not the     only  causes   of the increased radiation from     a moving
body.         (Compare Joule and Thomson,             Phil. Trans. 1860.)         A
vacuum apparatus now in course of construction,                will, it is hoped,
 lead to decisive results.

1. On the great Drift-Beds with Shells in the South-west of
    Arran. By the Rev. Eobert Boog Watson, B. A., F.E.S.E.,
    Hon. Mem. Naturw. Ver. Liineburg.
    These   beds, as examined  by the author, lie in the Torlin or Kil-
morie Burn basin, in the Scoradale or Slidry Water basin (more
strictly in the first north or north-west tributary of each, reckoning
upwards from the sea), and in the Clachan Glen, — all in the south
west of Arran. They are of great extent and depth ; at certain
points they contain boreal shells in considerable numbers.        They
are divisible into two classes, (1.) underlying fine dark sands and
 clays ; and, (2.) overlying coarse red clay with striated stones, pro
 bably boulder clay.
    They  are interesting, because,
    1. They present, in a striking form,       proof of the   immense
 destruction of the surface of the land.
    2. They afford unusually good sections, from the rock on which
 they rest, upwards.
    3. They throw some light on the formation of the boulder clay.
    4. They present sea shells, at one point land plants,   and also at
 one point a later lake basin.

                                                   is,
      That all the latest geological changes have not materially
     1.
affected the relations of hill and valley.
     2.      That the valleys were largely excavated by ice.
     3.      That the ice covered the land till  was submerged.

     4.      That the depression of the land              below   the sea was   con
tinuous, and ultimately attained 1000 feet at least.
             That the depression was, at one point at least, sudden.
     6. 5.
             That this sudden fall did not begin later, at least, than the
time at which the present 90 feet line above                 the sea-level reached
the level of the sea.
     7.      That this sudden subsidence could not have amounted to less
than 200 feet.
     8.      That   it   could not have much exceeded 300 feet.
     9.     That under obvious limitations, the beds which lie nearest
the       sea-level and deepest belmo the surface, are the oldest, and that
those are contemporary which occupy the same relative position                  to the
sea-level and the underlying            rock.

certain defiuito points of the hydrosome in the Plumularidae.
These contents              were shown to consist of

are very extensile and mutable in shape, and exactly resemble the
pseudopodial prolongations,              whose occurrence among the Rhizopoda
is    so     eminently characteristic      of this group of Protozoa. The con

of thread-cells,            are   indistinguishable in structure, and in the phe

The following Communications were read : —
 1.  Description of the Lithoscope, an instrument for dis
    tinguishing Precious Stones and other bodies. By Sir
    David Brewster, K.H.
        The Instrument was exhibited.
 2. On the Temperature              of certain Hot Springs in the Py
      renees.      By Pi. E. Scoresbt-Jackson, M.D., F.R.C.P.
    In   the year 1835, Principal Forbes          very carefully observed the
 temperatures      of certain    springs    in the Pyrenees, with the view
 of ascertaining     to what extent changes of temperature occur iu
 them.      Observations previously       made were, for several reasons, of
 uncertain worth, and Principal Forbes was desirous of then fixing
 " data for future observers with         a  degree of accuracy hitherto un-
 attemptod."
    The author having determined to spend his autumn holidays in
 the Pyrenees, believed that a careful repetition of such observa
tions, after the lapse of twenty- eight years, would afford results of

some interest.       He furnished himself with accurate thermometers
made    for the purpose, and, during the month of August, carefully
observed the temperatures of several of the springs visited by
Principal Forbes in 1835.            In  the tables   which    are   distributed
through the paper, the temperatures of the springs                are  given   as
recorded by different       observers at various        periods   between the
years   1835 and 1863.        From these records it would appear that
whilst there is perhaps in no instance a general or permanent
change of temperature, neither is there in any an undeviating
temperature.       It is probable that the temperatures of the springs
in the interior of the globe have undergone              no change,    and that
the changes observable upon the surface             of the earth    are   due to
superficial causes, such as external         temperature,   the infiltration of
cold   surface   water, &c.      To  a certain   extent,   an allowance     must
be made     for inaccuracies   ;  for it is scarcely to  bo supposed that     all
the observers dipped      their thermometers exactly at the same points,
uor does     the author know that in all cases the instruments em
ployed were without errors.
3.   On   Human Crania allied in Anatomical Characters to
    the Engis and Neanderthal Skulls.                     By Wm. Turner,
    M.B., Senior Demonstrator of Anatomy in the University.
    The Author compared the above crania with various human
skulls which had come under his observation.                  He exhibited a
skull brought by       Mr Henry Duckworth, F.G.S., from St Acheul
near   Amiens, which in its general contour presented a striking
resemblance to the Engis skull. The St Acheul skull was somewhat
smaller,    being probably that of        a female.    It  might almost have
been regarded as a reduced copy of the Engis skull.              There was no
evidence that the skull from St Acheul was of an earlier date than
the   Gallo-Roman period of French history.                 The Neanderthal
skull was compared with several modern crania, mostly British,
especially     with reference to the projection         of the    supra-orbital
 ridges, the retreating      forehead, and the slight convexity           of the
 occipital region.     He exhibited several skulls which were closely
 allied to it in one or other of those features.      It was shown also that

162                 Proceedings            of the Royal       Society
the Neanderthal skull, although below the European mean in it*
internal capacity,           yet exceeded the dimensions             of   some    normal
modern      European                       carefully measured — its
                             crania which had been
large transverse parietal diameter compensating for the brain space
lost by the retreating forehead and flattened occiput.
     As the history and geological            age   of the Neanderthal skull        were
both      unknown, and            as many     of its most striking          anatomical
characters     were         closely   paralleled      in some modern         European
crania,    the Author          considered      that   great   caution ought to be
exercised in coming to any conclusion,                   either as to the pithecoid
affinities or psychical endowments of the man to whom                      it originally
appertained.
4.Notice of a Simple Method of Approximating to the
 Roots of any Algebraic Equation. By Edward Sang, Esq.
     M. Lagrange, on applying the method of continued fractions to
the resolution     of numerical           equations, discovered that, for those of
the second degree, the quotients                   recur periodically.      From this,
combined   with the previously well known fact that all periodic
chain fractions belong to quadratics, he inferred that periodicity is
exclusively confined to equations of this order.
     In January    1858,      I   showed to the Royal Society that the series
of approximating fractions obtained by M. Lagrange can be con
tinued in the opposite direction, and that the convergence then is
to the other root       ;   and enunciated the general theorem, that               if any
two    fractions   be       assumed, and      if   a progression    be    formed    from
them by combining fixed                multiples of their members, this pro
gression, which     I       called duserr or two-headed,           may be continued
in either way, and gives on the one hand the one, on the other
hand the other root of a quadratic.
     This would    seem        to confirm      Lagrange's view of the limited
application    of periodicity.
     However, we may observe that our attention                  has been restricted
to one kind of periodicity            ;    there may be recurrences          of higher
orders which may belong to equations of higher degrees.                          Thus   if,
instead of beginning with two fractions, we had assumed three, and
formed the progression by combining specified multiples of the last,

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1863-64.                             163
the penult and the antepenult, the terms of the progression would
approach to some limit which, not being the root of a quadratic,
may    be the root   of a cubic or   of some higher equation        ;   such a pro
gression may be extended backwards, giving an approximation                        to
another    root ;  and we may still farther complicate           the recurrence
by using four, five, or any number of fractions.
    While engaged in examining the nature of such progressions,
and seeking for a demonstration of some general properties which
they   seemed to possess,     I came upon a very simple theorem, which
gives great facility in the      search  for the roots of equations.
    If we put an    algebraic equation in the usual form —
                     axf + bx"— 1+                 px + q = o,
multiply each term by its exponent          ;  thus,
                    nax* + n—     1 bx»—  1+   . .  . . p + 0,
and divide the expression          so obtained     by the original polynome,
developing the quotient according to the descending powers of x,
the resulting series takes the form
                n + Ax-^ + Hx-i+Gx-s + T)x-*+ &c.                 ;
or  if we  develop the quotient according to the ascending powers of
x, and change the signs, we have, writing from right to left,
                        + &c. +&C4 -ryx3 +       (3x2  +ax,
and these two series conjoined make a duserr progression                  ; thus,
 + &c. +Sxi+yx^+Px2+ax + n + Ax-1 + Bx-1 + Cx-s + Dar-4 + &c.,
 approaching      on   either   side to a     geometrical      progression,       the
common ratio of which is a root of the equation              ; that is to say,      if
 we divide the coefficient of any term by that of the term to its left,
we   shall have an approximation        to a root more and more close the
 farther we proceed along the series.            The approximation on the
right hand is to the root farthest from zero, that on the left hand
to the root nearest to zero.
   If the   equation   2x3-lla;2 + 13x-3 = 0 were proposed, we should
form from     it the expression 6:s3-22x8 + 13a:-0, and, by division,
thence form the progression

without the necessity of going through the details of the division.
   If we denote by r> , ra , r3 , &c., the roots of the equation, the co
efficients of the powers of x            in the duserr progression are the                      sums
of the powers of rv            r2, &c. inverse            of the power of x ; that is              to

Now      if we  have a number of unequal quantities,                      r, , r2 , r3 , and take
their successive powers, the power of the largest of them may he
made to exceed the sum of the corresponding powers of all the

 others in any required         proportion,    bo  that  if R denote the greatest
 of all the roots, the      ratio Rm : 2   (r")   may be brought,        by taking m
sufficiently great, as nearly to a ratio of equality as we desire                  ;  of
necessity, the      ratio R"^1    : 2 (r'H-1) will be still more nearly that of
equality    ;  wherefore the quotient
                                       2(r"'+i)
                                         2(r"0
may be made to approximate                to the value of      R within any pre
scribed degree        of nearness.
    Similarly, on taking the successive inverse powers, those of the
greater diminish much more rapidly than those of the smaller
quantities     ;  wherefore we may continue the progression towards the
left hand     until the sum 2 (r— m) may have to the            — m,h    power of the
least root, p, a      ratio differing from that of equality        as   little as may
be   desired, in which case the two ratios
                                    2 (r-m), and p-™-1 :p-m
                                  ,

 will be nearly alike          that is to say, the quotient                          will
                             ;
                                                                      i  (r-»-i)
 differ from     the smallest root, p, by an imperceptible quantity.
    The chief use of this approximation will probably be found in
 practice to be to give a        starting point for the more rapid methods
 already    known, which methods           are  only rapid when the root has          to
 be   approached        from   a small distance.        Yet, having obtained            a
 pretty close approximation,         s, to some root, we have      only to make the
 substitution       x —         to obtain a new equation,
                         s—y,                                      having one root
 very   small in comparison with the others, and to which, therefore,
 the approximation by this method will be very rapid.
     When the root R is positive, the signs of the quantities A, B, C,
 &c. become continuous             and +    ;  if R  be negative,       they must      be
 alternate     ;  and  it is to  be observed      that  if  the coefficients     of the
 even     powers of x become negative,             the root must be imaginary.
 Also,    if  there should be two roots,           R and    -  R', nearly equal to
  each other, the coefficients of the odd powers will become small in
  comparison with those of the even powers, in which case it may be
  convenient to take
  as the   formula for approximation,

 5.   Notice of the State of the Open-Air Vegetation in the
        Edinburgh Botanic Garden, during December 1863.
        By J. H. Balfour, A.M., M.D., F.R.S., F.L.S.
     The state of the vegetation in the open ground of the Botanic
 Garden during the month of December 1863 was so very remark
 able that   I have   been induced to submit a notice of it to the Royal
 Society.     The number of phanerogamous species and varieties in
 flower during the month amounted to 245 ; of these 35 were spring-
 flowering    plants which had anticipated     their period of florescence,
while the rest were summer and autumn flowers which had pro
tracted their flowering beyond their usual limits.
    The following are the details      as given by Mr M'Nab : —

    I have drawn up a list of all the plants in flower during Decem
ber, arranged according to their natural orders         ;   and    I  have also
requested    Mr James Tod, one of my assistants, to dry              a complete
series of the plants, and to exhibit them in one view on pasteboard.
    In looking    at the list we shall find that the following spring-
flowering plants developed flower-buds and blossoms             : —

    The state of vegetation in December was much influenced by the
nature of the weather during the preceding months of October and
November.            No marked check was given to it during these months,
and the temperature was such as to stimulate the action of the cells
and vessels of the plants.              In  December     the comparatively      high
temperature           continued.      I have asked my friend,        Mr Alexander
Buchan,      Secretary of the Scottish Meteorological Society,              to draw
up for me a tabular view of the temperature                  of the three months
during the last seven years.              I have supplied the lowest daily tem
peratures, as observed in the Botanic Garden ; and for want of suffi
cient data in the garden, he has selected for the other data a sta
tion in Fife (Balfour) where the temperatures in general resemble
much those noticed at the Botanic Garden.                    (I hope to be able to
make arrangements               in future for  a  full series of thermometrical,
barometrical,          and hygrometrical observations          being made at the
Botanic Garden.)

Report on        the  Weather    of   October, November, and December         1863,   as
   compared with the previous             Six Tears. By Mr Alexander Bcchan.
    The first three tables present a detailed statement of the tem
perature in October, November, and December, during the seven
years ending with 1863, as observed at Balfour, near Markinch, in
Fife, one of the stations of the Scottish Meteorological Society. It
is the nearest station to Edinburgh at which full and well-authen
ticated observations on temperature                    have been made for so long      a
 period, and, besides, its position              is such as to represent fairly both
sides of the Forth.
     Table     I.  gives the mean monthly temperature of the day and of
 the night, and the mean temperature of these months for the past
 seven years, and a comparison of 1863 with the means of the pre
 vious six years.        From this Table,         we learn that the peculiar features
 of the weather of October, November, and December last,                    as respects
 temperature, were as follow : —
     In   October, the mean temperature was nearly a degree (0°-8) above
 the averago of the month              ; but whilst the mean temperature of the
 day was less than half a degree (0° 4), that of the night was about                   a

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1863-64.                        173
  degree   and a-balf (l0-4) above the average, thus indicating a cloudy
  sky and comparative absence of frost.            At the Botanic Garden, the
  thermometer      fell only three times to freezing, the lowest being 28o-0
  on the   night of the 6th. This frost continued but for a short time,
  and   very little damage was done except             to Heliotropes; dahlias
  were  only slightly affected.
    In November, the mean temperature was               4°-2 above the average,
 which     increase    was very unequally distributed         between    day and
 night,  — the mean temperature of the day being               5°-2, and of the
 night only 3°-2 above the mean of the month.                 This temperature
 is not  only greatly above the average, but it is also about a degree
and    a-half higher than any previously recorded November, and 60-6
                                                '
higher than the November of 1862.
    In December, the mean temperature was 3°-5 above the average,
and the manner of its distribution between day and night similar
to   November,     — the   mean of the day being 4°-2, and of the night
2°-5 above     the average.
    Hence the characteristic         feature of the weather of this period is
the nnprecedentedly          high temperature      during the day in Novem
ber and     December, — a point to which special attention is directed.
    Table    II. gives   the highest      temperature of the day, and Table
III.   the lowest temperature of the night, in each week of the period
under consideration.
    Table    IV.  gives the number of nights each week on which the
temperature       at the Botanic Garden        fell to freezing or lower, and
an    asterisk is put to mark those cases when it fell to at least G°'0
below freezing.
    These tables furnish the data from which an explanation                 may
be had    of the remarkable vegetation of December last, in so far as
that depended on the character            of the then current weather. The
explanation is twofold        — first, the high temperature during the day
in November and December ; and, secondly,             the comparative absence
                                   ,
of frost   during the night.
    This remarkably high temperature was preceded by a period of
cold weather,      extending from the 29th of October to the 12th of
November,       during which frosts were of frequent occurrence.             At
Balfour     the thermometer,         four feet above the ground, and pro
tected,   fell to 26'-5    ;  and at the Botanic Garden, four feet above
                 '

the ground, but exposed,         it fell to 23°5, and indicated freezing      on
ten nights.       Though dahlias and other plants were destroyed,            yet
many survived, owing,        it is supposed, to the remarkably dry      state of
the weather, and to the very brief periods during which the severity
of the cold in each instance lasted.              This cold period also con
tributed to the remarkable growth which followed, since by playing
the part of winter, though in a modified degree, it arrested the vital
functions,     and gave plants       the benefit of a fresh start with the
warmth which succeeded.
   The unprecedentedly          high temperature      began  on the 13th of
November,       and continued with scarcely any interruption       till Christ
mas  :   see Table   II.  Of this period the warmest part extended         from
the 13th of November to the end of the month, during which the
mean temperature of the day was 52°'5, or 9o-0 above the average.
This day temperature          usually prevails    about the end of    April    or
beginning of May, when the temperature of the night is much               lower
than obtained in November           last.
   In   the end of November        and beginning of December (see Tables
III.   and   IV.),  the temperature of the night declined occasionally
to freezing.       At Balfour it fell to 30o,0, and at the Botanic Garden
(exposed) to 26o•0, — a degree of frost insufficient to damage those
nutumn flowers which had stood the more severe frost in the begin
ning of November, or check the growth of the spring flowers rapidly
coming into bloom.
   This anomalous        weather      sufficiently accounts for the    strange
spectacle of     sweet peas and Hepaticas blooming together.

 1.  On the Influence           of the Refracting Force of Calcareous
    Spar on the Polarization, the Intensity, and the Colour of
    the   Light which it Reflects. By Sir David Brewster, K.H.,
     F.R.S.
    In the " Philosophical Transactions " for 1819, the author had
 shown that the doubly         refracting force of calcareous spar extended
 beyond     the sphere of the reflecting force, producing a change in

  176             Proceedings    of the Royal   Society
 the polarising angle varying with the inclination of the incident
 ray to the axis of the crystal,     and producing    a deviation   of the
 plane of polarisation   from the plane of incidence       and reflexion,
 when the reflecting force of the crystal      was reduced by contact
 with oil of cassia and other oils.    These experiments were made on
 the face of the primitive rhomb.
    In  the present paper, the author gives an account of the results
which he obtained upon other natural and artificial faces of           cal
careous spar, inclined 0°, 5J°, 12°, 22 J°, 67 J", and 90°, to the axis
of the crystal.    On all these surfaces, when the reflecting      force is
reduced by contact with oil of cassia or other oils and fluids, the
intensity and colour of the reflected pencil,      and the deviation of
the plane of polarisation    from the plane of reflection, experiences
remarkable changes, depending on the inclination of the incident
ray to tho axis of double refraction.
2. On the      Most Volatile Constituents of American Petro
                leum. By Edmund Eonalds, Ph.D.
    It was shown by this paper that the gases dissolved in American
petroleum, and which gave to       it such a high degree of inflamma
bility,   were composed    of the lower    members     of the marsh     gas
series, having the general formula,
                              C» Hjin+i, H,
and to which the liquid products have already been referred.
    The gases evolved from the Pennsylvanian oil were collected at a
temperature of    - 1° Cent., as they floated, mixed with air, over the
surface of the liquid in the casks in which     it is imported into this
country and the hydrocarbons were shown by eudiometrical analysis
to have the composition of a mixture in nearly equal proportions
of the hydrides of ethyl and propyl.
    The first portions of incondensible    gas evolved on warming the
most volatile product of the distillation of petroleum on a manufac
turing scale were also found to contain     a mixture of these hydrides,
while portions of gas collected at a later period of the operation
approached more closely to the composition of pure hydride of pro
pyl, or were mixtures of the hydrides of propyl and butyl       ; the last
gas collected being nearly pure hydride of butyl.

                      of Edinburgh,    Session 1863-64.                            177
   The liquid condensed by a mixture of ice and salt during the
collection of these gases gave, upon redistillation, a considerable
portion boiling between      0° and 4° Cent.    ;  this,  as well   as  that which
 passed over as high as 6° Cent., was shown by analysis to be nearly
 pure hydride of butyl having the composition              C4H9,  H.
    This liquid has a specific gravity of O600 at 0° Cent.              ;   it is con
 sequently    the lightest liquid known.          Its vapour density was by
 experiment found to       be 2-11.   It  is colourless, possesses           a sweet,
 agreeable smell, is soluble in alcohol and ether, but not in water.
 Alcohol of 98 per cent. dissolves between 11 and            12 times     its volume
 of the gas at 21° Cent. The liquid and the gas              are not    preceptibly
 affected by sulphuric or nitric acid, nor by bromine               ;  mixed with
 twice its volume of chlorine in diffuse daylight, the gas is con
 verted into liquid chloride of butyl, while the original three volumes
 become condensed into two volumes of hydrochloric acid.
 3. — On the      Action of Terchloride of Phosphorus on Aniline.
                       By Magnus M. Tait, F.C.S.
    More than a year since my attention was directed to a statement of
  Hofmann's, that the action of terchloride of phosphorus on aniline
 yielded   a white substance   of crystalline character,        as the investiga
 tion  of  this  compound   so produced    seem'ed     likely to be of interest,
 I  began    its  examination,   but  circumstances prevented me from
 completing it at that time.         The publication of SchifFs papers,
  however, on the metal-anilides     again drew my notice to the subject,
  and I considered    it a duty to  myself to publish the results of my
  experiments,    more especially as the reaction which forms the sub
 ject of this paper appears to have          escaped      the attention        of that
  chemist.
    Terchloride of phosphorus was added, drop by drop, to the ani
 line, which required to be kept cool by ice, as the reaction tends to
  be of a rather violent character, great beat being produced.                    In  a
 short time the whole solidified into      a soft    granular mass, which dis
 solved readily in water, alcohol, and ether.          The   mass was dissolved
 in hot water, and, on cooling, the excess of aniline            rose to the sur
 face as an oily layer, and was separated by passing                  it through      a
 moistened filter.      The watery solution      was evaporated         at ordinary

178                     Proceedings              of the Royal          Society
temperatures over sulphuric acid, and when it had reached a syrupy
consistence          it slowly solidified               into    a mass       of fine needle-shaped
crystals, which were the hydrochlorate                                of a new         base, to    which   I
give the name of Phosphaniline.
   The crystals were well pressed between folds of filter paper, and
then being placed on a filter, were washed with a very small quantity
of alcohol and ether               ;    again dissolved, and evaporated as before, the
crystals were pure.                    The substance            so obtained           dissolves easily in
water, alcohol and ether, and is neutral to test-papers.                                 Gently heated,
it sublimes, and gives fine prismatic crystals. Treated with solu
tion of potash it is decomposed.     Strong sulphuric acid expels
hydrochloric acid, and gives a colourless solution.                                          Nitric acid
oxidises       it,   and gives         a   coloured solution.
     On analysis,       it   yielded the following results                    :   —

  This analysis shows that the substance   produced by the direct      is
union of the chloride of phosphorus and aniline. It      however,                            is,

in which three equivalents of hydrogen are replaced by phosphorus:

     Platinochloride         of        Phosphaniline.         — A    portion of the original salt
was dissolved  in water, the solution acidified with hydrochloric acid,
and bichloride of platinum added, in      short time crystals began to

and dried over strong sulphuric acid, until their weight was con
stant. They were in the shape of small granular crystals of light                                   a
yellow colour, soluble in alcohol and water, but not in ether. On

   The platinum in the third column was estimated by direct igni
tion, the    high result obtained was probably owing to the formation
of  a little phosphide of platinum.
   The analysis corresponds with the following formula : —

   Zincochloride       of Phosphaniline. — Hydrochloric             acid   was added
to a  portion of the solution of the hydrochlorate in water, and then
some    fragments      of pure zinc were thrown in. After the zinc had
dissolved       the fluid was evaporated at a gentle heat (about 200°
 Fahr.), and filtered       from a few greenish        flakes which had formed,
as  even   that low temperature appears to decompose the salt. The
clear fluid was then put over sulphuric acid and left for some days,
when crystals of a zinc salt were obtained, but under the same
conditions as the hydrochlorate,             as the    solution was very concen
trated    before the salt appeared, and then it solidified completely.
The crystals were pressed between folds               of filter paper, and washed
 with a   mixture of alcohol and ether, and dried in vacuo over strong
sulphuric acid.          They were white needles, slightly deliquescent,
and     soluble     in  alcohol.       In ether it     does     not dissolve,    but   it
 becomes      liquid, having the same appearance                 as a drop     of oil in
 water.
    The chlorine only was estimated, the analysis gave —

     Bromine       water   immediately precipitates             a  brownish-coloured
 substance       from   an aqueous solution of the hydrochlorate.                   This
  precipitate      was washed with water, and a portion of it boiled for
  some    time, and found          to be insoluble    in water; but        a substance
  appeared to have       volatilized along with the vapour of the water,               as

  180              Proceedings     of the lioyal   Society
 the neck of the flask and a glass rod which was held over               the
 mouth of    it were covered with white feathery crystals. The fluid
 was filtered, and, after drying the hrown residue, it was put into a
 beaker covered with filter-paper,     and left over a water-bath,    when
 it nearly all sublimed in crystals corresponding        to those obtained
 when attempting to dissolve it.       A  few of these crystals were dis
 solved in alcohol and bichloride of platinum added, but no preci
 pitate   was formed,    and   on   evaporation   the  original  substance
 crystallized out.    These   circumstances    indicated   the body to    be
 Tribromaniline.     The filtrate from the brown substance        obtained
 originally was treated with bichloride of platinum also, but no        pre
 cipitate forming, it was presumed no bromaniline or bibromaniline
 had been formed.
    Cadmium Salt. — Chloride of cadmium gives, with strong solutions
 of the hydrochlorate,    scaly crystals   of a double salt, moderately
 soluble in water.
    Copper Salt. — On adding chloride of copper to a solution of the
 hydrochlorate,   and evaporating    over sulphuric acid, small granular
crystals of a beautiful green colour are obtained.
    Mercury Salt. — If a strong solution of chloride of mercury is
added to a concentrated solution of the hydrochlorate, beautiful
 white scaly crystals precipitate out immediately ; but if the solu
tions are dilute no precipitation takes place, if the solution is now
 warmed, a crystalline substance is thrown down.          This appears   the
 more curious,    when  it is known that the other salts cannot           be
 heated without decomposition.
    When the hydrochlorate     is heated with potash the phosphaniline,
at the moment of separation, appears to undergo decomposition, for
the smell of aniline is apparent even in the cold, but no precipita
tion   takes place, so that    phosphaniline must be itself soluble in
water.     An attempt was made to obtain it in the separate state by
acting on the hydrochlorate with oxide of silver, a precipitate of
chloride of silver was formed immediately.          The filtered fluid was
alkaline to test paper ; it clearly contained phosphaniline, but on
evaporating the fluid it became coloured, owing to the decomposi
tion of the base, which is very changeable, and cannot         be obtained
in the pure state.

            4.   On Fermat's Theorem.            By Professor Tait.
   The author stated that in consequence of Legendre's work, the
proof of Fermat's Theorem is reducible to showing the impossi
bility of
                                   x"=y"+z",
when m is an odd prime, x, y, z          being integers.
   Talbot has shown that in this           case x, y, z are necessarily  com-
poiite numbers.
   The author shows, among other results of very elementary pro
cesses, that if numbers can be found to satisfy the above equation,
x and     y leave the remainder         1 when divided by m ; and that        z
has m as a factor.          Many farther limitations are given on possi
ble  values of x, y, z — the process being based on the consideration
of their prime          factors,  and   on Fermat's     Elementary Theorem
N" - N      =  Nm.

 with a species of shagreen, and mounted in silver. An exceedingly
 simple and ingenious arrangement,              consisting of a double screw
 working four small arms of brass, was placed at each end for the
 purpose      of regulating the distances between each pair of glasses,
 and    silver dial plates enabled the operator to set the instrument
 according to his ascertained requirements. The instrument belongs
 to the   Royal Institution of Liverpool, and is supposed tc have been
 part of a collection of rarities, made by Wm. Roscoe, in Italy.
  As  a telescope, it is of great power       ;  the focus is adjusted by one
  portion of the case acting as a draw-tube within the other part.

   The following Communications were read                 : —
1. On the     Gods of the Rigveda. By John Muir, D.C.L., LL.D.
   After some preliminary remarks           on the common      origin of the
Indians,    Greeks, and Romans, — on the expectation          thereby raised
that we should find     in the earliest literatures of these nations some
remains    of the primeval mythology which their ancestors must origi
nally have possessed in common, — on the partial fulfilment of this
expectation by an examination of these literatures, — and on the
greater   light thrown    by the Rigveda than by any other monument
of ancient poetry on the genesis of mythology, — the author adverts
to the  various theories of creation which would naturally be formed
by simple men       in the earlier ages of the world, to the manner in
which    the various great phenomena of nature would come to be
ascribed to different    deities,  and to the diverse    aspects in which
the grander      objects of creation,   such as heaven and earth, were
viewed, sometimes as inanimate,        sometimes as animated and divine.
The  chief deities mentioned      in the Rigveda    are then passed    under
review, and     their most remarkable characteristics      are described  ;
                                                                            —
viz. Dyaut and     Prithivi (Heaven and Earth), Aditi and the Adityas,
 Varuna     and Mitra, Indra, Vdyu, the Maruts, Rudra, Vishnu,
 Tvashtri,  Agni, the Asvins, Soma, Tama, and the various goddesses,
   rol. v.                                                        2 b

  Ushas, Sarasvati, &c. &c.      The writer then sums up the instances of
  well established    coincidence between the Indian and the classical
  deities, which he considers to be few in number       ; and concludes by
  noticing how the most prominent gods of the Rigveda lost much of
 their importance in the later mythology of India, while two of the
 deities who hold only a subordinate      rank in the Veda — viz.    Vishnu
 and Rudra — were afterwards exalted to the highest position.
    2.  On the Diffraction Bands produced by Double Striated
           Surfaces.     By Sir David Brewster, K.H., F.R.S.
     Having observed     a series  of serrated fringes in examining       the
 colours produced by the fibres of the crystalline lens of fishes,        the
 author    was led to imitate     them by the combination of grooves
 upon glass and steel surfaces, or of grooves taken from these sur
 faces upon isinglass    or gums.
     The interference bands thus produced were serrated or rectilineal,
 sometimes parallel and sometimes        at right angles to the direction
 of the grooves, and varying in their magnitude and character             ac
 cording as they were exhibited on the colourless image, or on            the
 diffracted spectra, or as they were produced at different        angles of
 incidence,    or at different distances of the grooved surfaces, or by
different   numbers of reflexion,    or by different numbers and combi
 nations of refracting and reflecting surfaces.
     The grooves   on glass employed    by the author were executed by
the late    Mr George Dollond, and those on steel, varying from          315
to   10,000 in an inch, by the late Sir John Barton.
3.     An Essay on the Theory of Commensurables.              By Edward
                                 Sang, Esq.
     The subject of this essay may be described as an application of
the Theory of Number to Geometry, its principal or characteristic
problem being to determine under what conditions the sides or sur
faces of figures may be represented by integer numbers.
     Like all other inquiries into the properties of integers, it is  rather
speculative     than practical, and yet, perhaps on that very account,
is more apt to engross the attention       of its cultivators than   almost
any other department of pure mathematics.             It seems, indeed, to
be of very little moment whether we can demonstrate that the sum

                            of Edinburgh,              Session 1863-64.                       •               185
of two cubes never can be a cube                        ;     and yet one after another of the
moat       eminent mathematicians                  have tried, and, though foiled, have
again and again              essayed the proof of Fermat's negation.                                         So it
may also        appear to be a matter of indifference                                 whether or not we
can    construct         a four-sided         figure which may have its four sides,
and also      its two diagonals, all integer multiples of the linear unit                                           ;
and    yet such inquiries present to the mathematician                                            attractions
sufficiently powerful               to balance              those of more              practical        investi
gations.
   Nor is the labour bestowed on the cultivation of such subjects
altogether or in any degree lost, since the various branches of
science are so interwoven,                that     we cannot improve our acquaintance
with one without augmenting our knowledge of those allied to it.
  The first part of the paper is occupied with the subject of the
orthogonal trigon, and is a collection of previously known proposi
tions, the novelty,           if   any, being in the arrangement.
     The second powers of numbers form the only exception                                               to   Fer
mat's      Theorem; the sum of two squares may                                    be a square          number;
that is to say, the equation
                                              «'   +   fi2   =     C2
is   possible    in integer numbers            ;       or, in other words, the altitude, the
base, and       the hypotenuse of              a   right-angled trigon may all                           be ex
pressed      in integers.
     Among the remarkable properties of these Pythagorean                                          numbers,
as they are         often called, are that, when in the lowest terms, one or
other of the two sides               is   divisible by              3   ;   that one or other of the
two sides       is   divisible by     4   ;   and that one of the three                           is   divisible
 by   5.     These three propositions                       are     all exemplified           in the well-
known solution,
                                              3'   +   4' = 5'.
  It    is   also   a   very singular property, that the hypotenusal                                   number
can never       be      a   multiple of       7,   of        11,    of      19, or,   in general, of any
prime number            of the form        4n -        1,    unless the other also be so                 ;    and
thus that no prime number                     of that form can ever                      be   a   divisor of
the   hypotenuse when the trigon                       is    in its lowest terms.
     And as     a    companion,           we have            this other property, that every
prime number            of the form 4n+            1,       and every product of such prime
factors, may be the hypotenuse                     of   a        right-angled trigon.

186                   Proceedings     of the Royal    Society
   This part of the subject is completed by a table showing every
form of right-angled trigon, having its sides expressed in integer
numbers, with the hypotenuse under 1000.
   In   the second part of the paper, the properties of the angles of
such right-angled trigons are investigated             :  to these   angles the
name     muarif is given, and their values are entered opposite each
of the trigons in the above-mentioned table. Muarif angles are
defined to be those which have their sines and cosines rational             ;  and
it is shown that the sines and cosines of the sum, or difference of
two muarif angles, are also rational,         this property being analogous
to the   arithmetical proposition,      that the product of the sum of one
pair of squares by the sum of another pair, is also the sum of                 two
squares.
   This property of muarif angles is then applied to the demonstra
tion of various theorems, and to the solution of several problems.
In the first place, it is shown that if        a trigon    be constructed     with
two of its angles muarif, the three sides, the three altitudes, the
radius of the circumscribing circle, and the radii of the four circles
of contact,      are all commensurable, while the         area also is commen
surable with their squares.
   This proposition is then extended thus : that if at the ends of
any line assumed as a base, muarif angles (in any number) be
made, the sides of these extended indefinitely intercept segments,
which     are    all commensurable      with the    base,   and   include   areas
which are all commensurable           with the square of the base.
   And, farther, that the same property is extended to the sides of
all muarif angles made at any of the intersections of the above-
mentioned lines.
   Also, it is shown that         if  a straight line    be drawn    to touch    a
circle, and     if at  the point of contact any number        of muarif    angles
be made,      if the   extremities   of the chords thus formed        be joined,
and   if  tangents be applied at those extremities,          all the lines  being
continued indefinitely, then all the intercepted distances              are com
mensurable with the diameter, and all the areas with the square of
the diameter.
   It  is then shown how to construct a muarif angle which may ap
proximate with any required degree of precision to a given angle, and
thence how to find a rational trigon approximating to a given shape.

      The solution           is also extended                 to this more general problem                           :
having given            any polygon inscribed in a circle,                         to    find another ap
proximating to               it,   and having its sides commensurable                                   with the
diameter, and            its area with the square of the diameter.
     Afterwards,        it   is    shown how to construct                 a   trigon having its sides
and the       lines bisecting its angles all rational.
  In the third part of the paper the construction of polygons
having their sides, and also the ordinates of their corners integer,
is   discussed.
     The only regular polygons which can be used to cover surface
are the       trigon, the tetragon, and the hexagon.                              Of these the regular
tetragon or square                 is   the one in common use for the measurement
of    surface     ;    but, viewing the matter                       abstractly,         we may as well
measure surface               by triangular inches                   as   by square inches.                  Since
the    regular hexagon contains exactly six regular trigons,                                        it   follows
that, as      far as the doctrine of commensurables                               is    concerned,           there
are    only two possible systems of surface measurement,                                      — viz., That
with the square, and that                     with the equilateral                trigon      as the super
ficial    unit.
     The fourth section of the paper                         is    occupied in discussing the tri
gonal system            of measurement.                     Just    as the    right-angled trigon                  is
the    guide to the theory of tetragonal                            commensurables            ;   the trigon
having an angle              of 120°       is   the guide to the theory of trigonal com
mensurables.              The leading property of such                        a    trigon         is,   that   the
square     of the subtense exceeds the squares of the two containing
sides     by their rectangle but this   an enunciation in tetragonal

language       :      stated appropriately              it   is   this, that the equilateral trigon
constructed on the subtense,    equivalent to those on the two sides
                                                   is
together with the original trigon for in this system, the surface of

have no common                    divisor,    c    cannot be divisible by                  2,     by    3,   by    5,

form 6« +     l,  and every product of such primes, may represent the
subtense of 120°, the other sides being rational.
   It is worthy of remark, as a notable relation between the proper
ties of numbers and those of surface, that 4 and 6 are the only
moduli which separate prime numbers into two classes             ; all primes,
with the exception of 2, being of one or other of forms 4n — 1 and
4ra + l ; while, excepting        2 and 3, all belong either to the form
6»=1 or to       6»+l.      Four squares may lie round a point, and the
form 4n +    l,  includes all the hypotenuses of right-angled trigons;
six equilateral trigons lie round a point, and the form 6n +            1  con
tains all the subtenses of 120° or of 60°.
   A list  is given of trigons of 120°, in the lowest terms, of which
the subtense does not exceed 1000, accompanied               by the value     of
the smaller angle.
   This leads to the recognition          of muarif   angles  of the trigonal
system, possessing properties analogous to those of the common or
tetragonal system.
   Thus,   if  at the extremities    of any  base trigonal muarif angles be
made, all the segments into which the sides of these angles cut each
other are commensurable with the base, and all the areas with its
equilateral     trigon.
   And similarly, if at the point of contact of a straight line             and
circle, trigonal muarif angles be made, if the extremities of               the
chords be joined, and        if tangents   be applied at those extremities,
all the segments so formed are commensurable with the side,                 and
all the areas with the area of the circumscribed regular trigon ;           and
it may   be remarked that in the      trigonal system, the inscribed trigon
is commensurable         with the circumscribed,      whereas the inscribed
square is incommensurable          with the circumscribed.
    The existence of these two distinct, yet analogous systems of
muarif angles, naturally suggests the inquiry, whether there may
not be other systems as well.
    The fifth section of the paper treats of muarif systems in general ;
it shows that      if a trigon be constructed with sides, proportional to
any three integers whatever, its angles belong to a system of muarif
angles possessing properties analogous to those of the two preced
 ing systems, the assumed trigon, or any other             one of the  system,
becoming the unit of surface.

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1863-64.                                         189
      It   is also shown that no angle              of one can       be equal to that        of any
other muarif system,             with the exception of               180°    which belongs to
all systems.
      The general character            of     a   muarif angle         is,   that its cosine       is
rational     ;    the value of its sine may or may not involve the square
root of an unsquare number                ;    if   the sine be rational, the angle be
longs to the tetragonal             system   ;    but   ifotherwise, the irreducible surd
involved          in the expression         for the sine becomes the modulus or
maatar       of the system, and all angles having the same irreducible
surd       in the values of their sines, the cosines being rational, belong
to the      same system.
     The modulus of the common                      or tetragonal       system      is     thus   VI,
that   of the trigonal system             is   V3   ;   while the modulus of any other
system       is   the irreducible surd in the common expression for the area
of   any trigon belonging to it.
     The sixth and last section of the paper contains                        a   few miscellane
ous    propositions.           The first group of problems are                     cases    of this
general one,
                       " To      trigon, of which the three sides and
                              construct   a
the    lines dividing one or more of the angles into equal parts may
be    all commensurable."
     When only one angle               is    proposed to be divided,               or when two
angles are to be divided,             we can assume these as the proper multi
ples   of muarif angles of any system whatever;                          but when the three
angles are to be divided,             we find ourselves restricted                 in the choice
of the system.
     Thus,    if   we wish that the lines               bisecting    each of the angles be
rational, we must use the common or the tetragonal                               system, because
the    half of 180° belongs to it.                  While,    if    we wish       that the lines
trisecting the three angles be all rational, we must take the trigonal
system, because the             third part of       180°     is   among its angles.
     And    it    is   remarkable    that we cannot construct                a   trigon of which
the sides and the lines  dividing its angles into any other numbei
of equal parts than two and three, may be all rational, because no
aliquot part of the half revolution except the half and the third can
belong to any            muarif system.

excellent   work the properties of the muarif angles of the tetragonal
system are given     ;  and as there is no hint concerning            the higher
systems of these angles, my impression is confirmed that this part
of the subject is entirely new.

                        (Abstract by Professor Tait.)
    This is an abstract of an investigation which will be published
in full in " Thomson and Tait's Natural Philosophy."                 It contains
the application    of Green's wonderful results regarding the potential
to the determination of the centre of gravity of a system when
there is such a point.       Some of the more remarkable propositions,
which are thus established are as follows             : —
    If  the action   of terrestrial   or other gravity on a rigid body is
reducible to a single      force in    a   line passing always through one
point fixed relatively to the body, whatever be its position relatively
to the earth or other     attracting mass, that point is called its         centre
of gravity, and the body is called a centrobaric body.
    If a body is centrobaric relatively to any one attracting               mass,
 it is centrobaric relatively to every other ; and it attracts all matter
 external to itself as if its own mass were collected in its centre of
 gravity.
    The centre of gravity of a centrobaric body necessarily lies in its
 interior ; or, in other words, can only be reached from external space
 by   a path cutting through some of its mass.
    No centrobaric     body can consist of parts isolated from            one  an
 other, each in space       external     to   all ;  in other words, the     outer
 boundary of every centrobaric body is            a single closed surface.
     A given quantity of matter may           be distributed     in one way, but
 in only one way, over any given closed surface, so as to constitute              a
 centrobaric    body with     its centre of gravity         at any given point
 within it.
     Matter may   be distributed    in an infinite number of ways through

 out a given closed space,       to constitute     a centrobaric      body with its
centre of gravity at any given point within it.
   The moments of inertia of             a centrobaric    body are equal round
all axes through        its centre of inertia.      In other words, all these
axes are     principal axes, and the body is kinetically symmetrical
round its centre of inertia.

1.   Ou the Anatomy and Physiology of the Mitral, Tricus
   pid, and Semilunar Valves in Mammals, Birds, Reptiles,
   and Fishes.           By James B. Pettigrew, M.D., Edinburgh ;
    Assistant in the Museum of the Royal College of Sur
    geons of England. Communicated by Wm. Turner, M.B.
   The writer begins his communication                       by giving a brief de
scription of the structures in which valves are found, and takes
occasion to comment on the nature and properties of the veins and
arteries,   and on       the arrangement           of the muscular      fibres in the
ventricles,     as   these necessarily          influence,    to a greater     or  less
extent, the action of the valves.                He also adverts at some length
to   the shape       of the venous,            arterial,   and   auriculo-ventricular
orifices, and to the fibro-cartilaginous rings by which the latter are
surrounded     ;  as well     as to the    dilatations or sinuses which are found
behind or    to the outside          of the segments constituting the semilunar
valves in the veins and arteries, and to the shape of the ventricular
cavities, which,      as he points out, bear an important             relation to the
valves,   inasmuch        as they       determine     the direction in     which the
blood acts upon them            ;    precise information on these points being,
according to the author, indispensable to                 a just appreciation of the
subject under investigation.
    The object of the Memoir is to prove that in the valves, as in
other structures where modifications occur, we rise from the simple
to the more complex               ;   in other words, that the valves form            a
differentiated and gradually ascending series.
    In  the veins,    e. jr.,  the valve consists of a doubling of the delicate
membrane        lining the vessel, containing some fibro-cellular and
elastic tissue, the distribution of which in the horse can be readily
made out.       The segments of the valve are semi-trausparent,                 and, as
a rule, semilunar in shape.               They are further placed obliquely, one
only being present in the smallest veins, two in the middle-sized
ones, and three in the largest.                  Behind each segment there is a
dilatation or bulging of the vessel, which projects nearly                    as far in
an outward direction as the segment                    extends   inwardly, and gives
to the latter the requisite             degree of curvature.       As the dilatation
referred to enables the             lining membrane which forms the segments

194                Proceedings        of the Royal      Society
to project   boldly, and almost transversely, into the vein, it follows
that the free margins of the segments run for a certain distance in
a  nearly parallel direction,      the parallelism     being maintained        by the
presence of a fibrous structure,* which projects                from the wall of
the vessel, and not only supports the free margins, but carries them
fairly away from the sides into the interior.              This relation of       the
dilatations   to the segments, and of the segments to each other, has
not hitherto been recognised, and shows that the union between the
latter is not one of the margins            simply,  as has been supposed, but
of the margins and a considerable portion of the sides                ;  the sides of
the segments, on account of the angle at which they are set with
reference to each other, being more and more involved in proportion
to the amount      of pressure which is brought             to bear upon them.
The object of the dilatations            is evidently threefold — 1st (as has
been stated), To allow the free margin of the segments to project
into the interior, and maintain            a  position  with reference to        each
other   which    necessitates     their coming       rapidly and naturally         to
gether; 2dly, To increase the             space   occupied by the blood, and
thereby extend the area, and the amount of pressure to which the
segments are subjected        ;  and, 3dly (which is the most important),
To determine the direction in which the blood shall act, that being
from above downwards,           and from without inwards.               The effect of
this arrangement       on   the segments is very obvious            ;   these, when
two exist, being forced together in the mesial plane of the vessel,
where they      mutually support each other ; and when three are
present, in the axis of the vessel. In the latter case, the segments
(from   the more or less conical           shape assumed by their free mar
gins while in action, and from the fact of their apices being free
to move)     rotate to    a greater or less extent,         while in the act of
                    —
fixing or closing the closure being effected by a combined wedge
and spiral movement. f In the veins the closing of the valves may
be regarded as purely mechanical,             this being due not to any active
power residing in the segments, but to the pressure exerted upon
them by the blood, and to the vital contractility residing in the

veins, which tends to urge the segments                         together,        while it assists
the onward         flow of the blood.         In   the arteries, as,         e. g.,   at the origin
of the pulmonary           artery and aorta, the segments of the valve are
of a semilunar           shape, and always three in number.                           They consist
of a doubling         of the lining membrane,                  and contain            within their
fold certain tendinous           bands which run in well-marked directions                            ;
the     structure     closely    resembling         that      met with in the auriculo-
ventricular or highest                          The cusps, moreover,
                                     form of valve.*                                                are
semi-opaque,         stronger, and more ample than in the veins.
    In the arteries the dilatations behind the segments, commonly
called the Sinuses         of Valsalva,       are very large, and, as the author has
ascertained,        curve towards each other in such a manner as ensures
that the blood    will act upon the segments only in certain directions :
in fact,   that they will be urged by it towards each other, and fixed by
a   distinctly spiral wedging movement                   ;   the margins of the segments
flattening themselves against each other whilst in action, and form
ing an inverted     tripartite dome, the strength of which is limited
only     by the strength of the materials used in its construction.
The action of the arterial semilunar valves may also be considered
mechanical, the inconvenience                  which might            be supposed to result
from an excess           of vital contractility in the arteries and ventricles,
between  which the valves are situated, being counteracted by the
existence at this point of comparatively  unyielding fibro-cartila-
ginous      rings.       Strongly contrasting with the arterial semilunar
valves in mammals               whose area of activity              is,   so to speak, circum
scribed, are the         semilunar valves situated within the bulbus arteri
osus    of fishes, which        is   an actively contracting structure.                   In   these
cases the     segments, as           a   rule, are more numerous than in the veins
and arteries, and arranged                 in tiers,   so    that the blood which              is   not
caught        by   one tier falls into and          is   supported         by the next.         The
number of segments, moreover, obviates the                         evil effects which might
accrue from the displacement                  to   which they         are    subjected      by the
contraction        of the bulb.
      In the semilunar valves of fishes                  we find the first trace          of what
may be regarded as chordae                    tendineas, in the shape of tendinous

bands which run between the segments and afford a certain degree
of support.      The action of the valves in fishes is partly mechanical
and partly vital, for we must regard the contraction                    of the bulb    as
contributing to the closure.              In  the auriculo-ventricular valves of
mammals,       birds,    reptiles,    and    fishes,    we have      a great    variety.
These     valves     are   characterised       by   the    presence       of  tendinous
chords (chorda tendineae) which connect them with actively con
tracting muscular structures ; as, the interior of the ventricles
or the structures arising therefrom             — viz., the    carneao columnar and
musculi      papillares.       They     therefore     differ   from     the   semilunar
valves proper.        In  the auriculo-ventricular valves there is also gra
dation.     In    some instances, e.g., there is only one semilunar flap
or segment      ;   in   a second      there    are   two    flaps or segments,        so
arranged that their long diameters correspond                 to  the  direction of the
muscular fibres with which they are connected directly.                      In a third,
the two segments are attached to the interior of the ventricle                         by
rudimentary        chordce    tendinem.        In   a   fourth,    two     accessory    or
smaller    segments       are   added to the two principal ones, the                whole
being   attached     by well-developed        chordce    tendinece     to rudimentary
musculi papillares.         In   a  fifth, which is the most perfect form of
valve as    it exists in man, and in the higher mammalia, the seg
ments are from four to six in number, most exquisitely and symme
trically formed, and       attached    by minutely graduated chordce tendinea
to highly    developed      carnece    columnce     and musculi papillares ; the
latter being distinctly spiral.
   The action of the auriculo ventricular valves                        is varied, and
depends on the circulation, on the configuration                    of the ventricles,
and the shape of the ventricular cavities, which adapt and mould
the blood, and cause it to act in a definite or given direction.                       In
the Fish, the ventricle and the ventricular cavity are pyramidal in
shape, the ventricular fibres being so arranged that the organ con
tracts and dilates very much as one would shut and open the hand.
As, moreover, the circulation is languid, the segments of the                      valve,
when two exist, are forced towards each other, by the contraction of
the ventricle      and by the blood, in a manner analogous to that by
which the segments of the bisemilunar                  venous valves are approxi
mated, by the retrogressive movements of the slowly advancing
venous blood, assisted to a slight extent by the vital contractility

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1863-64.                               197
of the vessels.            In the Reptile, where the circulation is also lan
guid or slow, the shape of the ventricle or ventricles,* and of the
ventricular cavity or cavities, is conical                ;   the cone being        slightly
twisted upon itself.                 As the muscular fibres forming the ventricle
pursue a more or less spiral course, and this arrangement                           extends
to the valves,their action may be aptly compared to that which
obtains in the valves of the largest veins, and in those of the
arteries.      It    is,   however, in the auriculo-ventricular valves of the
Bird and Mammal that the spiral action of the segments becomes
most conspicuous the nature of the action being unavoidably de
                           ;
termined by the spiral arrangement of the muscular fibres forming
the ventricles, and by the spiral nature of the musculi papillares
and ventricular cavities.    As the two spiral musculi papillares
project into the spiral ventricular cavities, follows that between
                                                              it
them there exist two spiral grooves or depressions, and in these
the blood is arranged,                on   its entrance into the ventricles, in two
spiral columns        ;     that fluid, towards the end of the diastole                 and
the beginning       of the systole, advancing on the segments of the
auriculo     ventricular valves in spiral waves, from below upwards,
and  wedging and screwing them into each other in an upward
spiral direction the musculi papillares, by contracting, dragging
                      ;
the segments towards the end of the systole, by means of the
chordae tendineae, in an opposite or downward direction, to form                          a
spiral dependent cone, the apex of which points to the apex of the
heart.    The action of the auriculo ventricular valves      partly               is
mechanical          and partly vital, the musculi papillares and analogous
structures exercising,           through the chordae          tendineae,    at one time   a
restraining influence to prevent retroversion and regurgitation, at
another wielding      direct power for approximating and applying
                            a
them accurately            to each other.        The paper, which          is   based on an
extensive      series of dissections,            is   illustrated by upwards of 50
photographs         and drawings,           showing    the structure,      relations,   and
action of the valves.

ventricle into two.

2.  On some points in the Metrology of the Great Pyramid.
     By Professor C. Piazzi               Smyth, Astronomer Koyal for
     Scotland.
   This paper       was    an attempt to submit to a severe     and searching
examination,       the very new and apparently important ideas con
tained in the work, published four years ago by            Mr John Taylor of
                              "                                          "
London, and entitled The Great Pyramid              ; why was it Built ?      To
this end, the original authorities for measures of the Pyramid, had
been extensively referred to, from Professor John Greaves in the
17th century, down to Colonel Howard Vyse and                Dr Lepsius in   the
19th  ;    and their various and sometimes conflicting numerical state
ments       had been      computed     with all due attention      to scientific
accuracy, as well         as   every endeavour    to eliminate  both personal
and other sources of error in the observations.
   The result of this proceeding has been most eminently favour
able to all the more important and cogent of Mr Taylor's conclu
sions   ;   not only as to the probability of a common origin in pre
historic      times    for   the hereditary   weights   and   measures of all
nations, but as to there having been something                more than     mere
human intelligence concerned in their establishment              ; and also,   to
the Great Pyramid, besides having been earlier in date, being, in
all the spirit of its construction,        completely separated from all the
other Pyramids, as well as from everything usually thought typical
of Egypt, or peculiar            to the Pharaonic, or any other, dynasty       of?
the Egyptians        ;  and entirely devoid, in its finished parts, of even
the remotest and most distant             allusion to any form of idolatrous
worship ever practised by any nation of antiquity whatever.
   The calculations were prepared in full, and an astonishing series
of coincidences upon coincidences given, both as to the relations
truly connecting the dimensions of the Great Pyramid, with the
latest geodesically-determined          numbers for the size and figure of the
earth    ;  to the original founding of the standard of that Pyramid's
linear measure on the one and only absolutely correct scientific              re
ference which the earth contains          — viz., the axis of rotation ;  to the
connecting of its ancient measures of capacity and weight with the
weight,      or what goes, with the size, to make the weight,            of the

             and to the
typical to the Pyramid, even in the temperature secured for its
standards.
     There     then        followed   a     comparison      of the ancient

measures, in length, surface, capacity, and weight, with the Eng
lish hereditary measures still in existence among us ; and it
showed, first, the extreme                closeness of the two systems, especially
in the       smaller units employed chiefly by the working and poorer
classes      of our country ; and then, the remarkable convenience for
scientific purposes and questions of the present day,                         of the larger

                         Communicated by E. Sang, Esq.
     The author^ having had experience                      of the simple duodecimal
monetary system   of Portugal, which   accumulated by multiplica
                                                       is
tion from     decimal minimum unit, proposes to apply the same
                a
principle to the British coinage. Having also discovered, while in
Canada,        that the difference            betwixt the British coinage and                 a

to    overcome      this by altering the value of the present farthing, by
this rate,     making       it   the fifth, instead of the fourth of the penny               —
the penny       of   5     farthings would then become the duodecimal                       mul
tiplier of all the coins, making the shilling 60 farthings instead of
48,   and the pound 1200 instead of 960, and each intermediate                              coin
would        be represented        by one of the digits and one or two ciphers,

This would introduce the decimal principle into the coinage, with
out sacrificing either the pound or the penny, which it has hitherto
been declared          impossible      to do, while it would completely            revolu
tionise our arithmetic, and bring our money into accord with the
whole world.           By this slight alteration,          making no disturbance        in
the names or values of the coinage — affecting nobody injuriously,
but everybody beneficially — a change of notation from the present

and 1200ths, while the larger merchants                      and bankers      may keep
them in pounds and 120ths, greatly to the diminution of figuring
and arithmetical labour, while the conversion                       of the decimal into
s. and d. is the simplest             mental operation.
4.    On the Elevation   of the Earth's Surface Temperature
      produced by Underground Heat.       By Professor W-
      Thomson, F.R.S., F.R.S.E.
     Peclet found,by his own experiments, that a body with any
common unpolished non-metallic surface, kept by heat from within
at 1° higher temperature than that of the air and other objects round
it,   loses heat from each square metre of surface at the rate of about
nine kilogramme-water thermal units per hour, or, which                            is   the
same,     rjVffth of    a   gramme-water         unit from each square centimetre
per second.          The mean conductivity of the three Edinburgh                  strata,
in     which        Principal     Forbes's       underground        thermometers     were
placed,       is   2f grain-water units per second per square, foot per                  1°
per foot rate of variation of temperature,                     as
                                                                I     have shown pre

              strata                       l-64, according to  is
Angstrom (Poggendorff's Annalen, last volume of 1861).    The

 of conductivity       founded    on the gramme-water-second-centimetre
 units, is •005.      Taking this, therefore,       as an average     conductivity
 in the earth's upper         crust,   we find that      if  the temperature     in'
creased      downwards      at the     rate  of   1°   per   20 centimetres,    the
quantity of heat lost by conduction          outwards would be T^VTth ; and
 therefore,    according to Peclet's result, this would keep the surface
just 1° warmer         than   it would    be if  there were no conduction         of
heat from      within.     Hence,    to warm the surface to 10° Fahr. above
what    it would be if there were no conduction from within, the rate
of rise of temperature must be 1° Fahr. per 2 centimetres,                or •0656
of a foot (which would probably destroy the roots of any large tree
                                                     I
or plant), but at all events could not, as have shown,* be the real
condition of the earth at any time later than about 180 years after
even a greater       heating (7000° Fahr.) of the whole globe than the
greatest      we can suppose it at all probable the earth ever ex
perienced.       Hence it is certain that the climate can never have
been     sensibly    influenced    from    the earliest     "geological"    era by
underground        heat.     This    conclusion    was stated in § 17 of the
          already referred to
                                   "  On the Secular Cooling of the Earth,"
paper
 as rendered certain by a rough           general    knowledge     of the circum
stances,     without any approach to an accurate estimate of the                 ab
solute amount       of radiation.
    We now see, farther, that the present rate of underground                   rise
of temperature,        estimated     at 1° Fahr. per 50 feet, is only      ^th of
that    which is required to warm the surface by 1°.                   Hence the
 surface is only about -fatti of 1° Fahr. warmer at present than it
 would be if there were no supply of heat from within.

I.   On the Celtic Languages in their Kelation to each other,
     and to the Teutonic Dialects.            By W. F. Skene, Esq.
          (This paper    was given at the request   of the Council.)
    Mr Skene in his paper gave       a sketch   of the various views which
had been entertained regarding the Celtic languages, and advocated
the opinion that these languages          belonged properly to the Indo-
European    class.   He gave an outline of the distinctive peculiarities
of the two branches of the Celtic languages, the Welsh and the
Gaelic, and discussed the leading theories regarding the lost Pictish
language,    only five words of which were now extant.              Mr  Skene
had, as the result of his investigations,        arrived at the conclusion
that the Pictish language occupied a place between the Welsh and
the Gaelic — that it was a Gaelic dialect partaking largely of Welsh
forms.

 2.    On the Protection   of Vegetation from Destructive Cold
              every night.  By Professor W. Thomson.
     The effect of dew in protecting vegetation                   every clear       still night
of summer was long ago pointed                out by Dr       Wells ; the correctness
and acuteness     of whose views on this subject have been generally
recognised.      The hypothesis recently put forth by Dr Tyndall, that
absorption of radiant heat by aqueous vapour in the atmosphere is
an     effective defence against        destructive      degrees of cold, and the
ready acceptance     yielded    to    it by some of our highest authorities
in the popular      promulgation of the truths of science, seem to
render    it necessary to recall attention to Dr Wells' admirable work.
In the first place, when Dr Tyndall announces, as a result of his
experiments on radiant heat, that,
                                    " It is perfectly certain that
more than ten per cent,        of the terrestrial radiation from the soil of
England      is stopped within       10 feet       of the surface of the soil," by
the absorption    it suffers from aqueous vapour; it must                        be remarked
that this absorption     cannot         go on at the same rate through any
great thickness    of air.     For at the same rate half the radiant heat
would be absorbed      in 70 feet       ;   f in   140 feet   ;       ^
                                                                          in 210 feet, and    so
on, which     is inconsistent with known facts                    ;    as,   for instance, the
influence    of clouds on terrestrial radiation.             Hence the quality of
rays    which passes through the lowest 10             feet of air suffers less than
ten    per cent, of absorption in the next 10 feet; and                             it is quite
certain that after passing      through several times                     10 feet   of air, the
radiant heat must, by        having     been deprived      of the part of it liable
to absorption by aqueous vapour, be in a                  condition in which not
one per cent, is absorbed from it in its passage through 10 feet of
clear air.    Whatever influence             true vapour              of water really does
exercise   in checking, by its absorption, the loss of heat by radiation
from    the earth's surface, it  even in the most humid conditions of
                                  is,
optically clear atmosphere, insufficient to prevent heavy dews                           ;   far
less   than the latent heat of which, taken from the blades of grass,
or other finer partsof plants, would leave them destroyed by frost.
  In point of fact, therefore, heat actually   radiated away into
                                                              is
v»ry high terrestrial atmosphere and distant interstellar air or

204                       Proceedings    of   the   Boyal Society
aether, from the upper          and finer parts of living              plants, in so great
amount          every clear    night of summer, that destruction                   by frost
could not be delayed for many hours after sunset without a com
pensating supply of heat from some extraneous source.                         This   source,
on windy nights, is the thermal capacity of the air whirled about,
up and down, and among the stems and leaves of the plants.                                  On
still nights it is the latent heat of the vapour condensed into dew.
This vapour is taken chiefly from the air engaged among the stems
and leaves, which, in the case at least of fine grass, is all nearly
at the same temperature              as the leaves        ;    the temperature        of    the
surface of these being of course rigorously the same as that of the
air in contact.    Thus the temperature of the leaves can never go
below     the dew-point of the air touching them, and any cooling
which they experience after dew begins to deposit upon them is
only equal to the lowering of the dew-point, occasioned by the
amount of drying experienced by the air in consequence of the
condensation         of vapour out of it.
      Clouds,    as remarked      first by Prevost,           being practically      opaque,
prevent     the surface of the earth from tending by radiation to                             a
lower temperature            than their own, which, unless                 they    are very
high, is generally not much colder than the dew-point of the lower
air, but is at all events in general sufficiently warm to prevent the
finest blades of grass from acquiring any very sensible dew, or to
allow the general           temperature of grass and the air engaged among
it,   even on the stillest night, to sink as low as the dew-point.
Thus, either clouds, by their counter-radiation, or wind, by mixing
acomparatively thick stratum of air with that next the earth, keep
the grass and delicate           parts of other plants             from sinking to the
dew-point       ;   or,   when there    is   not enough of clouds            and wind        to
afford     this degree of protection,               dew   begins       to form,      and     by
preventing the temperature               of any leaf or flower from                  sinking
below the dew-point,            saves   them all from destruction,                unless,    as
when hoar-frost appears, the dew-point itself                     is   below the freezing
point.

  Sir DAVID BREWSTER, Vice-President, in                            the Chair.
   In   presenting      the  Keith Medal to Professor William Thomson
of the University of Glasgow, Sir David Brewster made the follow
ing remarks      : —
   It  is now nearly         half  a century      since the late   Mr Keith,      of
Dunottar, intimated          to me his intention to bequeath L.1000 for
the promotion of Science in Scotland, and to appoint me one of the
Trustees for the administration            of the Fund.    I cheerfully accepted
the trust, and pointed          out to   Mr Keith the manner in which           the
fund might be most advantageously                employed.
   In conformity with this          plan, the sum of L.600 was presented          to
the Royal Society,
                          " to form   a biennial prize for the most important
discovery in Science made in any part of the world, but communi
cated by its author to the Society, and published in its Transac
tions."      The rest of the Fund, which had increased                   consider
ably,   was subsequently          presented to the two Societies        in Edin
burgh, which had been instituted for the promotion of the Fine and
the Useful arts.
   Agreeably to the regulations adopted by the Council, the Keith
Prize for 1862 and 1863 fell to be allotted to the most important
discoveries in Physical Science, made during these two years.                    In
deciding upon its adjudication, the task of the Council was                as easy
as it was agreeable.         Professor William Thomson, who was            elected
a  Fellow of the Society in 1847, had, during the last                 seventeen
years, communicated           many valuable        papers to the Society,    which
added greatly to the value of its Transactions.                These papers, and
others    elsewhere      published,     relate principally to the Theories of
Electricity,      Magnetism, and Heat, and evince               a genius   for the
mathematical        treatment of physical questions, which has not            been
surpassed,    if   equalled, by that of any living philosopher.
    In studying       the mathematical         theory of Electricity, he greatly
 extended the general theorems demonstrated by our distinguished

countryman,     Mr Green, and    was led to the
                                                              "
                                                 principle of Electrical
Images," by which he was enabled to solve many problems respect
ing the distribution of electricity on conductors, which had been
regarded    as almost hopeless by the most eminent       mathematicians
id Europe.
   In his researches on Thermo-dynamics, Professor Thomson has
been equally successful.      In his        " On the Dynamical Theory
                                     paper
of Heat," published      in our Transactions for 1851, he has applied
the fundamental     propositions of the theory to bodies of all kinds,
and has deduced many curious and        important results regarding the
specific heats  of bodies, which have been completely verified by the
accurate   experiments of Mr Joule.
   No less important are Professor      Thomson's researches on Solar
Heat, contained in his remarkable paper     " On the Mechanical Energy
of the Solar System ;" his researches on the Conservation of Energy
as applied to organic as well as inorganic processes       ; and his fine
                                                              "
theory of the Dissipation of Energy, as given in his paper On a Uni
versal Tendency in Nature to the Dissipation of Mechanical Energy."
To these we may add his complete Theory of Diamagnetic Action, and
his investigations   rolative to the Secular Cooling of our Globe, and
the influence   of Internal Heat upon the temperature of its surface.
   The value of labours like these could not escape the notice of
the   Council of this Society,     and they would    have entitled their
author to the     Keith Prize, had they not been presented to the
Society when the Prize was devoted to other branches of Science.
It  is not, therefore,  for these researches and discoveries that the
Keith Medal has       been  awarded to Professor Thomson, but for the
very interesting and important discovery,        in Abstract Dynamics,
which he has communicated to the Society during the biennial period
appropriated to Physical Science.
   By the previous researches of Euler, Lagrange, Delaunay, and
Bertrand, it had been established that when any system of bodies,
connected by any invariable kinematic relations,          is struck  with
impulses     of any kind, the kinetic energy thus developed is a
 maximum.       This remarkable principle is of very great use in the
 investigation of certain complex dynamical problems, but in many
 important cases it is inapplicable.     In the motion, for example, of
 an incompressible   liquid, contained in a vessel whose form is suddenly
    vol. v.                                                     2 b

208                 Proceedings      of the Royal      Society
altered, it is not the impulse on the liquid which is given, hut                de
finite kinematic relations         are   laid down to which the impulsive
motion     must be subject.        In   such a case, Professor Thomson          has
shown     that   the kinetic energy which has been thus generated is
a  minimum ; and it is for this theorem that the Prize has been
awarded, — a theorem which not only affords a direct and simple
 mode of dealing with questions of more than ordinary difficulty,
but which is itself      an extremely      singular and valuable property         of
 Motion.
   The researches of Professor Thomson, to which we have                 referred,
are  of too recondite      a nature to be      generally appreciated.      The   re
sults of abstract      Science    have ever failed to excite the notice, or
call forth the gratitude, of the State.             The question of practical
use — the cui     bono  of ignorance — is put every day by educated           men
in high and responsible positions, to whom are confided the mightiest
interests of the nation.       History and experience might have taught
them, had they been capable of learning, that abstract Science is
the life and soul of Industry, and that its successful cultivators              are
the true benefactors, not of their country only, but of their species.
The discoveries of our eminent colleague, and even the very               abstract
property of motion, to which we have attached                 so special a value,
must, like all similar revelations,         find invaluable applications to the
material interests of society.
   I  should be doing injustice, however, to Professor Thomson were
I  to characterise      his researches      as  wholly abstract and transcen
dental.     The important conclusions which he obtained from the
Theory of Induction in submarine Telegraphs, have found a valu
able practical application         in the Patent Instruments for          reading
and receiving messages, which he so successfully                employed on the
submarine      cable across the Atlantic        ; and when that great work is
completed,     his name      will be associated     with the noblest gift     that
Science ever offered to Civilisation.            By his delicate Electrometers,
his Electric Spark Recorder,           and his Marine and Land Reflection
Galvanometers,       he has provided          the world  of thought with        the
finest  instruments of observation            and research   ;  and the world of
action with the means of carrying the messages of commerce                     and
civilisation which have yet to cross the uncabled oceans that                sepa
rate the families of the earth.

justly merited.
     In discharging this duty,                I    am    proud to think, and           I   am sure
that      all here will participate in the sentiment, that Scottish Science
has       such a representative in the University of the West, while, in
our own,        it has one of kindred genius and power.
     Professor Thomson,               I now   beg to present to you the Keith Medal,
and to congratulate                you on the honour           which you have              so   justly
deserved.
1.     On Vital Agency with reference to the Correlation of
     Forces. By William Seller, M.D,, F.R.S.E., Fellow of the
     Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.
     In this paper there is presented                 a series   of characteristic examples
of vital agency,              followed      by some considerations               bearing        on   the
extent to which, in a physiological point of view,                                it   can be ad
mitted         that the physical forces, under                   exchangeable          forms,        are
concerned         in organic          phenomena.            At the same time,          one      of the
particular objects of inquiry                  is,   whether      there be ground for the
belief that vital agency, being not                     a   force but   a   directive principle,
may accomplish                all the parts assigned             to   it,   solely by means of
the physical forces       variously modified through organic structure.
     It   is   laid down among the preliminaries, that no facts hitherto
discovered        bring the origin of organic                 life within the pale of in
ductive         inquiry   ;    that    the    transmutation           of species by natural
selection,       though       a   brilliant conception, holds           as yet no foundation
of an      inductive character          ;   that   it   remains therefore        a   fundamental
fact in physiology, admitting of no explanation, that all species
have their commencement in original parentage    and further, that          ;
it   is   thence correct in principle to maintain that all the multiplied
phenomena          in the life of       a   species, of whatever extent, derive their
source from         the potentiality of the reproductive                        cells in the pri
mordial        parent or parents of that species.
     It   is   also taken for granted                that such    a   directive principle,            as

 210                 Proceedings    of the Royal      Society
 that already indicated, must act through the organism and                    the
 organic fluids which take their first origin in this manner.
    The character of nutrition throughout organic nature is then
 dwelt on, with the purpose of showing that it is everywhere under
 the control of more or less perfect organic           (physiological)   atoms   ;
 that even reproduction       of species is nutrition of a more          special
 kind, the organic atoms supplied by each sex being thrown off only
 when the individual or individuals whence they are derived have
 attained a very perfect maturity.
    The maintenance of heat in organic bodies, and particularly in
 animals of perfect type, is next pointed out as probably indicating
 the true nature of the connection between vital agency and the
 physical forces, since in every case the higher temperature has a
 purely physical source, while it is nevertheless under the control
 of vital agency.
    A  rapid    view is next taken of acts of relation          in the animal
 world, as more immediately proving the necessity for a directive
 principle to explain, in any degree, the reference of such acts               to
 physical forces.
    Finally, the interference of       a directive   principle is represented
 as essential to show why vital agency at last puts a limit to its own
 operations, even when the material supplied is in abundance, first
 building up the springs of growth and limiting the size of each
 individual over which it presides, in accordance with the rule of
 the species  ;  next building up the springs of reproduction         earlier in
 the one sex than in the other       ;  and, lastly, building up the springs
 of life itself, and terminating the career of its own individual
 existence   in    a  manner    even     less intelligible   to  finite under
 standings than any of the most wonderful             of its acts of workman
 ship in the greatest vigour of its power.
    A few passages are then devoted to the exhibition of views taken
by Carpenter, Leconte,       also by Thomson       and Tait, in speaking of
organic   phenomena with reference           to the correlation    of physical
forces or to the conservation of energy.
   Affinity and aggregation      are   next reviewed at some length,        with
the view of showing that there is no essential difference              between
affinity in inorganic nature and that affinity which builds up and
repairs organic structures when the agency of a directive principle

                      of Edinburgh,       Session 1863-64.                     211
 is admitted    ;   that that directive principle operates through organic
 structure and the          protoplasma    in vegetable bodies, both of which
 owe   their origin in unvaried succession to the original parents of
 the species ;     that all organic structure at present in existence may
be traced     back to the state of vegetable protoplasma;                 that the
protoplasma       in the cells of the green parts of plants becomes aug
mented     by the assimilation of carbon and hydrogen in particular,
derived    from the carbonic acid and water of the atmosphere, and
that this operation         is purely chemical, aided by the merely physical
agency     of light   ;   that the presence of water in so large proportion
throughout the        living solids, pervading their atoms and interstices
like an almost         incompressible      atmosphere,    accounts for many of
the peculiarities         of organic    affinity, and among others for the
apparent     antagonism         between the attraction which holds together
the   living solids and that which,           on the failure of vital action, so
quickly reduces them to the state of purely mineral matter — the case
being    exactly parallel to that of water containing salts in dilute
solution, the concentration of which is followed by the precipitation
of such     insoluble salts       as can arise out    of the constituents of the
salts   originally dissolved in the fluid — finally, that the heat which
attends the exercise          of such affinities  as produce water and carbonic
acid is due to the rapid movement              of the strongly attracted atoms,
that being      to a     far greater degree than in the exercise of the
organic affinities.
    It is next     considered how far electricity is to be regarded as con
cerned under a        directive principle in the phenomena of life, and
particularly in the exertion of animal power.
    The facts ascertained with respect to electrical fishes are pointed
to as   sufficient    proof, that animals       nourished   and constituted     like
vertebrated      animals can generate a great amount of electrical force,
the peculiarities        of the electrical     fishes being in fact inconsider
able,   when compared with the effects produced.             It is further noticed,
that the general           result of the many experiments         made by recent
electro-physiologists          is to show, that during life, hardly any two
parts   of the animal body are in electric equilibrium. From all which,
and     many other facts, there appears to be nothing improbable                   in
the idea    that electricity is an active agent in the phenomena of life,
 more   especially in those of the nervous apparatus and the muscular

212                     Proceedings                  of the lloyal         Society
system.        Moreover, from what appears to be the fact, that electricity
is developed along with heat in the eremacausis or organic                                           decom
position under the influence of oxygen attendant on the occurrence
of vital phenomena, while the living body exists in such                                             a non
conducting medium                as   air   ;    the unsolved question already presents
itself — What becomes of that electricity ? At the same time, how
ever, it is acknowledged, that as respects physiology, electricity is
full of promise rather than of actual results. It is shown that                                            the
numerous, and, in some respects, contradictory experiments of                                              Du
Bois Reymond and Matteucci, prove that electricity exists in living
bodies, but do not conclusively indicate what                               it   does or can perform.
    The question of most immediate                             interest at present             in   connec
tion with the correlation                   of physical forces, is whether                     electricity
or heat, or partly the one, partly the other, be the representative of
animal power in muscular exertion.
    If vital    agency be assumed to be not a force — that                               is,   not   an im
mediate source of motion                — but only            a   directive principle analogous
to man's       intelligence when                it   compels the properties of bodies                   and
tho laws of nature               to     minister to the fulfilment of ends                             sug
gested to him by his appetites, desires, and capacities of enjoyment,
then, to avoid the alternative                       of representing force          as   springing         out
of nothing, animal force,               as manifested                  in muscular action, must            be
considered as metamorphosed from affinity, electricity, or heat.                                           In
continuance,     a     muscle can be conceived to be so built up by affinities,
as that   it   shall, under certain conditions,                         shorten itself and produce
a   mechanical      effect   ;   but such an effect can take place in this man
ner only once — to contract                      again       and again in quick succession
by the expenditure           of affinity,             it    would require to be rebuilt after
each contraction, which seems next to impossible.                                   A    muscle, there
fore, after one contraction,                    is   in the same predicament               as a weight
that has fallen from         a        height to the ground, which, to produce                           the
same effect     a   second time, must be raised to the same elevation                                       a3
before.    Is    it,   then, electricity, or heat, or partly the one partly the
other, which produces the renovating effect on the muscle                                      ?     One     of
the illustrations on this point                      is   the following: — Some physiologists
regard a muscle as being in its natural or spontaneous state when
in complete contraction, believing, that when the body    at                                   is      rest,
the molecular structure of the muscle   kept by some kind of      is                                  force

in a species     of constraint— that on the discharge of this force the
muscular     fibril contracts, and that the constraining force is immedi
ately renewed.        It  has been supposed that the force here operative
is   heat,  yet electricity seems        better fitted   for the purpose.      In
support    of this view is cited the analogy, indicated by some autho
rities, between the structure       of the muscular system and that of the
electric organs     in the gymnotus and torpedo.
    If such a view,   under whatever modification,        be rejected, heat must
be resorted     to as the source of animal power.
    To prove heat to be the source of animal power,            it must  he shown
that the products       of eremacausis, under forcible muscular exertion,
both account       for the whole temperature         manifested in the mean
time, and leave a surplus         sufficient to be metamorphosed         into the
calculated equivalent        of the mechanical         effect produced     by the
entire amount       of that exertion.
    Chemists pronounce         that the amount of heat in the combustion
of hydrogen       and carbon, whether        slow or rapid, is exactly propor
tioned to the products       in water and carbonic acid        ; nevertheless, it
may be doubted        if two  circumstances     have been taken into account
 in their estimate as respects the         living body, viz., the disturbance
 of electric    equilibrium in such combustion, and the reciprocal con
 vertibility of heat and electricity, so that it may turn out that, with
 the same amount of material products, there may be room for a
 reciprocal    variation in the proportions of these forces developed.
    Whence, though the product in carbonic acid and water be in
 exact proportion      to a given exertion      of animal power, the question
 appears   to be   still unsolved, Whether heat, or electricity, or both
 jointly, represent the equivalent         of mechanical force put forth in
 such   exertions.

 2.   On Sun Spots, and          their connection with Planetary Con
     figurations.      By Balfour Stewart, Esq. Communicated hy
     Professor Tait.
     The author      was led to examine        the sun pictures     taken by the
  Kew Photoheliograph, with the view of ascertaining                 if  any con
  nection   exists between the behaviour of sun spots and planetary
  configurations.

214                    Proceedings       of the Royal Society
     It   was found, that when any portion         of the sun's disc      recedes by
virtue of rotation from the neighbourhood               of Venus, it acquires          a
tendency to break out into spots, and, on the other hand, when
such approaches Venus, there is a tendency towards the healing up
of spots. Carrington's observations were then discussed, which                    seem
to show that, on the whole, the sun's surface is fullest of spots when
Jupiter is furthest from our luminary, and freest from spots when
he is nearest.   This action of Jupiter is not, however, much in
fluenced by the rotation of our luminary, perhaps because the sun's
diameter is small compared with the distance of that planet.                      The
mode of action of Venus and              Jupiter may both    be expressed by the
                 "
following law : — When               the sun's disc, or part of   it,   approaches    a
planet,      or when    a   planet    approaches   the sun's disc, there         is   an
absence of spots, or        a   tendency to luminosity produced."
     It   was then shown that this law was sufficient              to explain the
phenomena of variable and of temporary stars             ;   and, in conjunction
with Professor Tait, the author suggested that           it   might     be analogous
to that, in virtue of which two atoms rushing together give rise                      to
radiant light and heat.

       Some     of the following    Communications       were read : —
1.   Unpublished Letter of the late Professor Dugald Stewart.
      Transmitted by John Small, M.A., Librarian to the Uni
      versity.       Communicated by the Rev. Dr Stevenson.
     The letter which      Mr Small has sent to the Royal Society, and
 which, at the request of the Council,       I have the honour of bringing
 under the notice       of the meeting, was acquired by the University
 in 1861,     at the sale of the MSS. of the late Very Rev. Principal
 Lee.      It is by no means destitute of historical importance, though
 its  main value for us may rest on the consideration that it was
 written directly from the scene of the convulsion which         it describes,
 by Professor      Dugald Stewart to the Reverend         Archibald Alison.
 As    a  zealous student     of political philosophy, Mr Stewart took a
  lively interest in the early stages of the French Revolution.            He
  accordingly visited Paris       both in 1788 and in 1789;        and while
  there he maintained       an active correspondence on the subject which
  engrossed     him, with his friend Mr Alison.      Of this correspondence
  five letters, unconnected      with one another, have been printed in
  the Appendix to Professor Veitch's Memoir, which forms the first
  article in the tenth volume of Stewart's collected works.             These
  five are dated,     27th August 1788, 10th       May 1789, 30th May and
  4th   June 1789, 27th June 1789, and 17th September 1789.

      The letter now brought to light by Mr Small, the most interest
   ing of the series, so far as it is known to have been preserved, is
   dated 2d  July  1789, and is distinctly connected        with that   already
                                                                           "
   printed, of date 27th  June.      In  the latter the writer says :—        My
   Dear Archy   — I had begun    a   very long letter for you, which      I  find
   I cannot possibly get ready for you till next post            I must   there
   fore content   myself at present with mentioning to you, that              the
   day before yesterday,   t. e. 25th   June, the king sent     a letter to the
  clergy and noblesse, desiring them by every consideration of           regard
  for his person, and of attachment to their country, to unite           them
  selves instantly with the Tiers Etat, which they did that very day."
  That the document now before us is the " very long letter" thus
  referred to, becomes obvious from the facts, that it takes up the
  narrative of events at the 22d of the month, and that, towards the
  close, it mentions the union of the clergy and noblesse with                the
  Tiers Etat, in nearly the precise words quoted above.
     On the 17th of June, the Tiers Etat had declared themselves a
  " National Assembly," in consequence of which bold step, it was
 determined by the Court       party to close the hall of the said Tiers
 Etat till June    23.   On the 20th, proclamation to this effect was
 made by the Herald- at- Arms      ;  but the '' Assembly," excluded from
 their own hall, met in the Tennis -Court, and then took the famous
 Teunis-Court oath — with only one dissentient.              On the 22d, no
 fewer than 148 of the clergy joined the Commons or Tiers Etat,
 now assuming to itself the unusual name and the boundless powers
 of " L'Assemblee Nationale."          On the next day, the 23d, came the
 Seance Royale,    according to previous      proclamation    ; and here the
 letter of  Mr Stewart takes up the narrative.
     " My Dear ARcnY, — My last letter,      if I recollect right, was dated
 on Sunday, 21st     June, at which time everything here was in              the
utmost confusion.      On Monday morning, notice was given in Paris
that the    Seance Royale   would not take place       till Tuesday ; and in
the meantime      copies were distributed of a       letter from M. Necker
to M. De Crosne (who has the charge of the police in Paris), tend
ing to quiet the apprehensions of the people about the dissolution
of the States General, and assuring them that the K. was doing
everything in his power to conciliate the different orders. On

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1863-64.                            217
Tuesday       forenoon        I  went     to Versailles, chiefly from a desire of
                                                                    I
getting the earliest intelligence of the result (for had heard before
that no strangers were to be admitted into the Assembly), and                          I
arrived     just after the time the             Séance Royale was ended.         Every
body seemed to be in the greatest consternation,                      for the King had
gone to the Salie, without             M. Necker, accompanied by the Garde           des
Sceaux and the other ministers.                  The noblesse had retired with the
King, together with             a great part     of the clergy; but the Deputies of
the people were           still sitting, although the K. had given them posi
tive orders to separate immediately,                 and to assemble again the day
following. At that time everybody believed that M. Necker was
out of office, and it was generally supposed that the Prince of Conti
would be at the head of the new ministry.
    " The principal objects of the King's
                                                           speech were, to annul all
the arrêtes     of the Tiers Etat, from the time that they had constituted
themselves into the National Assembly, and to establish the mode
of voting par ordre, agreeably to the wishes of the majority of the
noblesse and a great party among the clergy.                      It  contains likewise
a  variety of most important concessions in favour of the people,
which     I  have not time to mention to you at present, and concludes
in the following             words (for, unfortunately for           His Majesly, the
speech     was immediately printed) : —
    "  '

          Je  vous ordonne,      Messieurs,     de vous    separer tout de suite,
 et de vous rendre demain             matin,    chacun   dans les Chambres           ap-

 consequence au Grand Maitre des Ceremonies de faire preparer                         les
 salles.'
      " After the King had
                                 retired, be sent two separate           messages to
 the Deputies of the people to separate, and received for answer that
 nothing but force should determine them to leave the Salle, or to
 interrupt their deliberations.        They then proceeded to pass a variety
 of resolutions, the chief of which were to persist in all their                former
 arrStes, and to continue their meetings as before, under the title of
 Assemblee     Nationale.
     " In   the afternoon     a great    crowd     assembled before the apart
 ments of M. Necker (among              whom       were some hundreds          of    the
 Deputies of the people, and many people of very high rank),                          re
 questing     him not to abandon them at             so critical  a juncture     ;  and
 about five o'clock, the very day that the above speech was pronounced,
 he received a message from the              King and     Queen.      He    remained
 with them     a considerable     time, and at last came out and told the
 people he was to continue         in office  ;  for, in their anxiety to know
 the result, an immense crowd had forced their way into the apart
 ments of the palace.          He made an attempt to return to his                 own
apartments by a private passage from the               King's closet, but      he was
forced out of doors by the people, and,            I am  told, was carried home
through a crowd who pressed forward                  to kiss   his clothes.        The
same evening fireworks were thrown                before his windows, and,         it   is
said, continued the greater part of the night.               I called   accidentally
next morning       on a gentleman,      who was in      M. Necker's apartment
during the whole of the business.                It is supposed that this very
extraordinary revolution, which took place so suddenly in the plans
which the King seemed to have formed in the morning, proceeded
from a discovery of the general dispositions              of the army,       and par
ticularly of the Guards.
     " Nothing of much consequence took place at Versailles the
three following days.          The Deputies of the people continued their
Stances, under       the title of Assemblee        Nationale,    and those of the

                      of Edinburgh,     Session 1863-64.                        219
 other    two orders in their own         chambers.        On the Wednesday
 (24th   June),    a considerable  number of the noblesse, who had been
restrained      hitherto by the instructions they had received from their
constituents, declared their resolution to unite themselves to the
National       Assembly, and the day following about fifty actually
joined the Deputies of the Commons. Among these were the Duke
of Orleans, the Comte de Montmoreucy,            the Due de la Rochefoucault,
the Due      d'Aiguillon, the Comte     de Clermot      Tonerre, and a number
besides     of the very first names in France.
    "  Despremenil,    and some others, particularly of the new noblesse,
 were   still blustering in their own chamber.           It is curious that Des
premenil, who was a roturier, and who has not yet held his office the
complete       term of years necessary to confer          noblesse^  should    have
been    on   this occasion the great champion of his order, although he
 was frequently reminded of the history of his family by some of his
 brethren, in terms abundantly humiliating.            It is said, in particular,
 that the    Due de Liancourt told him one day, in the Chamber of the
 Noblesse, — II faut avouer, Monsieur, que voire zele pour la no
                 '
 blesse   soit bien desinterresse     car il vous manque encore six mois
 d'etre  Gentilhomme,'       During this time the desertions of the clergy
 from   their own Chamber to that of the Tiers Etat were continuing,
 insomuch      that the President found one morning           a  bit of paper tied
 about the tongue       of his bell (the Presidents of all the three orders
 have a    small bell before them on the table, which they ring when
 they wish to establish      order in their Assembly),        with the following
 inscription, — Vox     damans in deserlo.
    "  At last, on Saturday, the King sent            a letter to the Chambers
 of the    Clergy and the Noblesse, desiring them to unite themselves
 without     delay to the National     Assembly,       which they accordingly
 did that very day.
    "
       Since that time nothing of consequence has been done, as 'the
  Assembly      has been wholly occupied      in verifying     the powers    of the
  new members,       and in some other preliminary business.              •

2.   The Law of Aeriform Volumes extended to dense bodies.
     By J. G. Macvicar, A.M., D.D. Communicated by Pro
     fessor    Lyon Playfair.
     In this   communication            the author proceeds to show that when
dense bodies, whether             liquids or solids,         are regarded as consisting
of certain      molecules,        the volumes         of these molecules are        either
equals, halves, or doubles, &c., as in aeriforms.
     This he proves by showing that the densities of bodies in                      gene
ral, as determined          by the balance, are proportional            to the numbers
which express the weights of their molecules.
  The author's theory of molecules is based on the following                      reason
ing. By the general consent of men of science, nature is                          a dyna
mical system — a system of applied mathematics.   The molecules
of bodies are, when compared with the other properties of bodies,
very stable clusters         of atoms.           In their     structure, therefore, they
may be expected to display in a high degree the geometrical and
the      dynamical,       that    is,   the     mechanical     conditions    of stability.
These conditions          in reference to individualised objects, each hav
ing but one centre, that      in reference to such structures as the
                                        is,
molecules of bodies, are most perfectly fulfilled, when the group
of their parts or particles, regarded geometrically,    reducible to    is
one or other of the regular                   polyhedrons.      These polyhedrons       are
five in pumber    and of these, three (the tetrahedron, octohedron,
                      ;
and icosahedron) are of the same order, all having triangular faces                         ;
and all the three may be regarded as culminating in the last named
and most perfect            of the three, viz., the isocahedron.                 But   the
icosahedron,        in its turn,        is    most intimately     related to the dode
cahedron,      each       under    the application           of the law of symmetry

                       of Edinburgh,              Session 1863-64.                                   221
developing       the other, each inscribing and circumscribing the other,
giving both as alternate forms, as the radius lengthens or shortens.
The remaining          polyhedron,          viz., the tube or hexahedron                        stands
out from       all the others, and         is,   in fact, singular, inasmuch               as   it   has
no   proper poles, and seems unsuited for polarized                           action.
     The author        therefore       fixes      upon       the dodecahedron              and        the
icosahedron       as the geometrical                  types of the molecules              of bodies.
He conceives        that their molecules                 may possibly consist              of       12 or
of 20 chemical         elements or units, either single units, binary units,
ternary    units, &c.,      as the case may be.            And he proceeds to calcu
late solely from atomic              weights,         and without any reference what
ever to   atomic volumes, the densities                      of liquids and solids on this
hypothesis.
     But previously to entering upon details, he finds                            it   necessary to
allude    to the    law of molecular              differentiation.            Not that there           is
anything new in this law               ;   for   it     is   merely the further operation,
when the       stability of    a   molecule       is    threatened by heat or otherwise,
of the grand    principle of all chemical synthesis, viz., the concur
rence     and apposition of dissimilar particles  but     modifies the  ;         it
number     of elements in          a   molecule according to the risks which that
molecule       has run     ;   and consequently              it   modifies     also the specific
gravity of the mass.               Thus taking               X   to represent          any chemical
element    ; instead of simple dodecatoms Xi2 or icosatoms X^, both of
which     are isometrical  as well as homogeneous, we may have                                          a
composite       molecule, Xi2X3u=X>s, consisting of both, the one diffe
rentiating the other, and thus securing                          a   greater stability for both.
Similarly single elements of                X may differentiate both XI2 and X^,,
giving    X     Xi2X   =
                           XU and X         X20X = X22.  And these two, in their
turn, may differentiate            each other, giving                 X   X,,X, X X^X           =   36X.
And here one of the limits of the theory as                             a   method of reaching
the construction           of molecules presents itself.                    Thus the compound
undifferentiated! dodecatom (Xi2)Ia, occupying four volumes,                                        must
give the same specific             gravity       as    X XUXX X^X             =   36X, occupying
                           12 x 12     X=
one   volume; for                           36X.
                               4
     To obtain densities in the familiar form of specific gravities                                   the
molecule or       unit volume of water requires to                        be determined.             And

this the author finds to  be a dodecatom (or rather an isobaric mole
cule), each constituent   element of which is 3HO
               = 36 aq=AQ=36x           9 = 324 when    H = l.
   He then proceeds to deduce theoretically the specific gravities of
between seventy and eighty of the most interesting and abundant
of natural and chemical substances, somewhat in the order in which
they are treated in chemical works.
   A   composite  molecule, consisting of the two isometrical mole

cordingly, that such is the molecule of the precious metals, or metals
that remain pure, and the diamond ; gold and silver having normal
or aqueous volumes,     platinum and aluminium half, and bismuth

3.  On the Freezing of the Egg of the Common Fowl.                     By
           John Davy, M.D., F.R.S. Lond. and Edin.
   The author, preparatory to stating the experiments which he has
made on the freezing of the egg of the common fowl, referred to
the early ones of  Mr Hunter on the same subject, and to the later
ones of  Mr Paget, both these inquirers agreeing         as to the results,
but differing in their conclusions, Hunter attributing the resistance
which the egg offers to freezing to     a supposed    vital principle, Mr
Paget attributing it to the peculiar viscid state of the albumen.
   The author, from his results, infers that two causes are mainly
operative in protecting the egg  ;  one, the  cellular filamentous struc
ture in which the albumen      is contained    ; the other, the peculiar
composition   of the contents of the egg, and especially their saline
elements.   He concludes by proposing some queries respecting life,
whether it can exist without action, and whether, provided the
organic structure is not injured, congelation     can take place without
the death of the part frozen.

4.    On the Variations of the Fertility and Fecundity of
     Women according to Age. By Dr J. Matthews Duncan.
     This paper was divided into four parts.                        In the first part it        was
shown      :   —
     1.   That the actual, not the relative, fertility of our female popu
lation,        as a whole, at different      ages,      increases from the commence
ment of the child-bearing period of life until the age of 30 is
reached, and then declines to its extinction with the child-bearing
faculty.
     2.   That the actual fertility is much greater before the climax,
30 years, is reached, than after it is                  passed.
     3. That at least three-fifths of the population                            are recruited   from
women not exceeding 30 years of age.
  In the second part it was shown : —
     That comparative fertility increases gradually from the com
     1.
mencement of the child-bearing period of life until about the age of
30 years is reached, and that then it still more gradually declines.
  2. That it is greater in the decade of years following the climax
of   about 30 years of age than in the decade of years preceding the
climax.
     In   the third part    it   was shown      :   —
     1. That the fecundity of the mass of wives in our population                                 is
greatest at the commencement                 of the child-bearing period of life,
and after that epoch gradually diminishes.
   2. That the fecundity of the whole wives in our population in
cluded within the child-bearing period of life
                                                                       is is,
                                                before 30 years of
age   is   reached, more than twice as great as                   it        after that period.
     3. That the fecundity of the wives in our population                                 declines
with great rapidity after the            age   of 40      is   reached.
     In   the fourth part    it   was   shown — :
     1.   That the initial fecundity of women gradually waxes to                                  a
climax and then gradually wanes.
     That initial fecundity very high from 20 to 34 years of age.
     2.                                 is
     That the climax of initial fecundity
     3.                                   probably about the age
                                                               is

 5. On the    Chemical and Physical Principles in Connection
    with the Specific Gravity of Liquid and Solid Substances.
    By Otto Richter, Ph. D. Communicated by Professor
    Maclagan.
    The subject of this paper, is of      a nature to find favour with all
those chemists who are disposed to recognise in the fast accumulat
ing evidence of    a new and remarkable order       of chemical   phenomena
 rich and valuable materials       for the construction    of a sounder and
 more comprehensive       chemical    theory.    This new order of     pheno
 mena   appears to me, nevertheless,          but  imperfectly    appreciated
and understood, even on the part of our most distinguished experi
mentalists.    Thus, for instance, Monsieur Pasteur, the illustrious
French philosopher, and with him a host of other eminent thinkers,
is of opinion, that matter is indebted for its chemical and physical
properties mainly and exclusively to the peculiar manner in which
the   atoms are     grouped    together.    In alluding     to the probable
cause of circular      polarisation,   Monsieur Pasteur considers,        that
this singular property ought to         be referred   to the unsymmetrical
disposition of the constituents,         and that    the restoration   of  the
chemical    symmetry     must at the same time obliterate         every  trace
of circularly polarising power. Again, in order to account for the
fact, that certain salts, for instance the chlorate of soda, cease to
exhibit circular polarisation      so soon as they are made to pass from
the solid   into the liquid state, he ventures even a step farther.
According to him these optical phenomena are really due to two
distinct  causes,   either   to the dissymmetrical distribution        of  the
atoms within     the limits of each individual          molecule,  or to   the
spiral form of aggregation       impressed upon entire masses       of  mole
cules, although these latter may, as individuals, exist in a             state
of chemical    symmetry and optical        neutrality.     Monsieur   Pasteur
adopts the following mode of reasoning : — The chlorate of                soda
owes its optical activity mainly and exclusively to the spiral form
of aggregation ; and being destitute of that property, so far as its
individual molecules are concerned, it follows, that the destruction
of the spiral arrangement during the process of solution, must leave
the chlorate of soda optically, because constitutionally,
                                                                      passive

    This argument, which prima facie seems so ingenious and plausible,
    is,nevertheless, in my opinion, void of foundation, because  rests                    it
    on premises              which   are empirically     and philosophically        inadmissible.
    In the first place, empirically, because the hypothesis postulates,
    that   ray of light
           a            propagated, both within and beyond the polar
                                 is
    ising medium, in the form of   spiral whereas Monsieur Tresnel,
                                                  a          ;
    another distinguished French philosopher,                        has clearly proved, both
    experimentally and mathematically, that the plane of polarisation
    assumes this twisted form in virtue of the mutual interference of
    two pencils of light, into which the original beam has resolved
    itself, and the particles of which, instead of vibrating as formerly
    in straight lines,           are    henceforth      made to vibrate      in the direction
    of    a   curve, and across two opposite regions                      of the influencing
    molecule.            In   the second place, philosophically,           because the hypo
    thesis places             us between the horns           of the following dilemma              :

      Now,        well known axiom of cosmical economy, that, in try
                   it   is

    ing to interpret facts, we ought not to multiply causes unneces
    sarily, an3 that one and the same class of phenomena                                 ought,   if
    possible, to be referred to one cause only                   ;   but when, as in the case
    before     us, these causes            are    so essentially      distinct, both in their
    form and in their mode of action,                        the arguments       employed         by
    Monsieur Pasteur, unsupported                      as they are    by either experiments
    or calculations,           appear to me no longer tenable, and              it   behoves us,
    therefore, to search for             a   more consistent         and comprehensive            ex

    alluded to, and which embraces the following principal physical
    properties of matter,              — viz. specific gravity, specific volume, allo-
    tropism and polymorphism,                    fusing and boiling points, crystalline

 228               Proceedings     of the Royal       Society
 form, optical,   electrical,  and magnetic      polarity, &c., the     general
 aspect of this order of facts     seems to me so marked          and peculiar,
 and at the same time so unchemical,         that    I consider   myself justi
 fied in vindicating, for their scientific conception and interpretation,
 the existence    of a principle sui generis, — a principle which, in
 virtue of its characteristic mode of action,         I  hold to be capable of
 modifying the chemical and physical energies of every part of a
 given atomic system, and all this, be it well observed, with the
 entire preservation of the original arrangement.             Let me, in illus
 tration of my meaning, assume, in the first place, that the so-called
 atoms, — a definite number of which         I  conceive to be always and
 inseparably united according to some fixed principle of grouping,
 and   thus   to constitute    an elementary       atomic     system or mole
 cule, — are endowed with repulsive energies directly proportional            to
 the range and intensity of their own vibratory movements, which
 latter may be supposed to consist in a series of periodical expan
 sions and contractions     of each spheroidal atom ; let me assume, in
 the second place, that under the influence of a certain physical
 agent the whole, or a given portion, of the atoms composing                    a
 molecule   may experience      a suspension     or restoration     of their vi
 bratory movements      ; and let me assume, in the last place, that the
 specific volumes of substances in the liquid and solid state depend
 upon and correspond to the degree of repulsive energy thus deve
 loped in contiguous conflicting molecules        ;  then, by means of these
 three assumptions, we have established a nexus causalis between the
 variations in the specific volume of dense molecules and between
 the intensity of their repulsive energies.         Now it   seems to me very
 clear that, so long as the peculiar     force, which causes these varia
 tions, and which   I will provisionally distinguish by the term paralytic
force, happens to induce       precisely the same changes upon any two
 opposite sides of a given atomic        system, the physical symmetry
 of that system will not      be disturbed,    but, on the contrary, that,
 when these changes differ, physical symmetry can no longer exist,
 and that the natural result will be the formation              of an ethereal
 current from the stronger towards the weaker side during the act
 of atomic expansion, and of another current iu the contrary direc
 tion during the act of atomic contraction.             Applying this view to
 the phenomena of circular polarisation,            I   have no hesitation in

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1863-64.                       229
 maintaining, that they have their origin in physical dissymmetry
only, and that the existence of the vaunted chemical dissymmetry
is at least very problematical.        The reason, therefore, why chlorate
of soda and its congeners lose the property of circular polarisation
during the act of solution must be sought in differences of tempera
ture and the altered state of aggregation, both of which conspire
in restoring the physical symmetry,         while the process of crystalli
sation tends to produce the opposite effect.          I  may add, moreover,
that the discovery of a substance exhibiting the same optical de
portment     as chlorate    of soda,  while these physical processes are
reversed, would prove a      powerful argument in support of my view,
but utterly subversive of Monsieur Pasteur's mode of reasoning.
   The theory here advocated naturally leads us to suspect the
existence of another set of equivalents, namely, the volume equi
valents  ;   their numerical expression         would     correspond   to  the
highest degree of repulsive        energy, and to the greatest amount of
vibratory movements, of which the various species of elementary
molecules are susceptible.         They would, however, differ materially
from the weight equivalents,          which   are  constant,    whereas they
would, on the contrary, be subject to a peculiar law of variations,
which enables them to pass through a series of values from a given
maximum down to zero.             I  am not at present prepared to enter
into details, but a careful       comparison of facts has convinced        me
that the variations       in the specific volumes of the molecules, or,
what comes to the same thing, the variations in the volume- equi
valents of their component elements, are genetically connected, and
 run parallel with the modifications       of their various physical pro
perties.   If,  then, all the chemical and physical properties of matter
are   due to the simultaneous         agency   of two essentially     distinct
principles, it follows       that chemistry,     both   as  an art and as a
 science, rests not on a simple but on a complex foundation. On the
 one hand,    it is the purely chemical principle which determines the
 various forms of molecular arrangement, and it is the ponderable
 portion alone of the various kinds of atoms, which, in their con
 stant weight-equivalents,       furnishes  the basis of calculation.      On
 the other hand,      it is the purely physical     principle which deter
 mines the specific volume of the molecules, and it is the imponder
 able portion alone of the various kinds of atoms, which, in their

230                  Proceedings          of the Royal              Society
variable       volume-equivalents,          furnishes          the    basis of calculation.
Accordingly,        our tree of chemical             knowledge            splits up into       two
main branches,         to which we might apply the terms Pondo-che-
mistry and Impondo-chemistry.                   I
                                 beg to remark, in conclusion,
that having resolved upon a minute and thorough investigation                                        >
of this, no doubt very intricate, subject,                      I
                                           was surprised to find,
after examining all the principal sources of information, that a
complete and trust-worthy catalogue of the leading physical pro
perties of matter was            still    a desideratum,             but more particularly
that the determination                of the specific gravities             of   substances     in
the liquid and solid state had been much                             neglected.       With     the
most ample resources at my disposal,                     I   have at length succeeded
in composing         a catalogue         of these latter.             The number of           bona
fide cases entered therein amounts to about 1800 ; but this number
 is after all a mere fraction, in comparison with the hundreds of
thousands of non-determined                bodies.       I   may also state, that should
a systematic        revision     of this most needful portion of our science
be resolved upon,           1   shall feel great pleasure in presenting my
catalogue, such as it            is,   to the parties entrusted with its execu
tion.
6.   On the Theory of Isomeric Compounds.                                  By Dr A. Cram
                                           Brown.
     In this    paper only those bodies are considered which are
                                                                 "                            abso

per cent. and the same molecular weight, but also the same constitu
tional formula.            As the constitutional formula of comparatively
few substances        is   known, this class  as yetissmall one.     a
     The following pairs of substances                   are    probably         absolutely    iso
meric.
     The alcohol radicals and the hydrides,
     1.                                                              as   methyl gas    and the

      7.  The  two varieties  of malic acid.
      8.  The two varieties of aspartic acid.

   1.    The compounds of ethylene and of ethyl idene.
   2.    The alcohols' proper and the hydrates of the defines.
   3.    Lactic and paralactic acids.
   The next point considered        is the influence   which the existence
of such     pairs of substances has on the theory of atomicity, and
particularly on the question whether all the equivalents of a multe-
quivalent atom are of the same chemical nature.
   The consideration      of absolutely isomeric bodies leads to the con
clusion    that there is a difference among the equivalents of the same
atom, and      that this difference   is not entirely due to the structure
of the molecule       of which the atom forms a part.       It is not, how
ever,    possible  as yet to apply this principle to the explanation of
particular cases.
   The remarks of Professor Kekule on the isomerism of the dehydro
genates     of succinic and of pyrotartaric acids, and those of Professor
Bntlerow on the isomerism        of methyl gas and hydride of ethyl, are
then considered in detail, and Butlerow's hypothesis compared with
the views of Kolbe as to the chemical nature of carbon.

7. On     the Khombohedral System             in Crystallography.           By
    Alfred R. Catton, B.A., Scholar of St John's College, Cam
    bridge, and Fellow of the Cambridge Philosophical So
    ciety.     Communicated by Professor Tait.
    1. The science of Crystallography has for its object the classifi
cation of crystalline forms.
    The principles which must guide us in attempting to arrive at a
natural classification of crystals are the same as those which have
been so successfully    applied to the formation of a natural classifi
cation of plants by Ray and Jussieu, and of animals by Cuvier.
    By the application of these principles it has been found that
crystals are formed on six different types or plans of structure, and
in consequence crystals have      been arranged      in six primary    classes,
termed crystallographic systems.         They  are named the      cubic,  pyra
midal, rhombohedral,      prismatic,   oblique, and anorthic systems.
    It is the object of this paper to show that the type on which
crystals of the rhombohedral      system are constructed       is the same    as
 that of the prismatic system.
    The establishment     of this proposition necessitates the abolition
 of the rhombohedral      system, and all crystals hitherto included in
 it must in future   be referred to the prismatic      system.
    2.  In  order to establish this proposition    it is necessary to show,
       (1.) That three axes of symmetry can be found at right angles
          to each other, such that for them the crystallographic para
          meters become unequal.
       (2.) That the laws of symmetry of crystals of the rhombo
          hedral system are the same as those of the prismatic sys
          tem.
     Now it is easily   seen that the threo    straight lines perpendicular
  to the planes 101, 121, and 111 are at right angles to each other.
     For the forms   101 and 211     differ only in position, the    one being
  the same as the other turned        through   an   angle of 30° about the
  optic axis.
     Also the faces of the form     111 are   perpendicular to the     faces of

                         of Edinburgh,        Session 1863-64.                        233
each     of the above forms.          The three straight lines perpendicular
respectively to the faces 101, 121, and 111, are taken as the new
axes of       symmetry; the parameters corresponding                   to them being
a, b, e,   respectively,   it is shown in     a later part   of the paper that      a, b, c,
are     unequal.
   3. The paper then proceeds to show that the laws of symmetry
of crystals of the rhombohedral system are the same as those of the
prismatic system.
   This is done by taking each simple form separately and finding
what       the indices of its faces become when referred to the new
aies; it is then found that the new indices for all the simple forms
follow the laws of symmetry of crystals of the prismatic system.
   The same process is followed with the hemihedral forms.
   4.    In   order to find the indices of a given face referred to the new
axes,      it is necessary to solve the following problem : —
   1!
        Given the indices and parameters of any face of a crystal when
referred      to given axes, to find its indices and also the new parame
ters when referred to any other axes              originating in the same point."
   This problem is solved in the paper, but the solution is too long
to be      here given.
   For the purposes of this paper only               a   particular   case   of the gene
ral problem is required.
   For in the rhombohedral system the axes make equal angles with
each other, and the parameters                are equal.      Let   <o be   the angle be
tween the rhombohedral              axes, and a the magnitude           of each of the
equal       parameters.     Let hkl     be the symbol         of a face of      a   crystal
belonging to the rhombohedral                  system,     and h'k'Z the indices          of
this face when        referred to axes perpendicular respectively                   to the
faces 101,      121, 111,    o',   b',c, the new parameters.
      Then the formula obtained               in the general    case become,        in this
instance,     —
                                          6                                             (!•)

                                         +    l
   These expressions give the new indices.

  The new parameters                        are given by the                     following           formula;.

                                                       (   1   + 2cos            o) 1   A
Where x is       a constant.

                                  " angular element" of                           a crystal            of the     rhombo-

the faces 100 and 111.
  Then it is shown in the paper, that the expressions                                                       for the     new

of its several faces when referred to the new axes can be determined,
and also   the ratios of the new parameters.
    The simple forms of the rhombohedral           system are then taken in
succession,    and the indices of their faces when referred to the new
axes   are found.     It  is then seen that the new indices follow in all
cases the   laws of symmetry of the prismatic         system.
   This is done at length           in the paper.     The general process is
exemplified     here   by its application       to one or two simple     forms
only.
   7.  The   simple   form 101, consists of the following faces.
                           101        O11       110
                           fOl        O11       110
By theformulae     (1.), it is found that the new indices    are, respectively,
                           100        110       110
                           100        ITO       llO
    These indices    are  divisible into two groups,

                           An,1{loo
    Now,   it will   be observed       that in the first group, the indices
always occur     in the order    1,  1, 0 ; and that the symbols of the faces
consist  of every possible arrangement of the symbols dbl,           ±1,   0, in
which    unity occupies the first and second places, and zero the last.
    The faces of the first group, therefore, follow the law of sym
 metry   of the prismatic system, and belong to the form 110.
    Similarly,  the faces
                                        100
                                        100
 belong to the form 100.
    Hence, the form      lOf of the     rhombohedral    system, is a combina
 tion of the forms 110 and 100          of the prismatic system.
    In  a  similar manner it can          be shown,   that the form 211, is a
 combination of the forms 310 and 010.

  A   combination       of these scalenohedra              is  a   combination   of the forms
122, 534, 714 of the prismatic system.
   The scalenohedron          Ml itself       is a   combination        of three hemihedral
forms with parallel         faces,   viz., —

   12.The simple forms of the rhombohedral system, therefore, with
the exception of the rhombohedron hkk, and the scalenohedron hkl,
follow the law of symmetry of the holohedral forms of the prismatic
system.        Hence   it   follows that the hemihedral                 forms also, derived
from these simple forms, are subject to the laws of symmetry of the
hemihedral forms of the prismatic system.
   Since the rhombohedron              and scalenohedron are themselves com
binations of hemihedral            forms with parallel faces of the prismatic
system,    it   follows     that     the hemihedral                forms derived      from     the
rhombohedron       and scalenohedron                are combinations        of tetartohedral
forms, with inclined and parallel faces, derived from the hemihedral
forms with parallel faces of the prismatic                      system.
  These tetartohedral          forms with inclined and parallel faces, de
rived from the hemihedral forms with parallel faces, may                             be denoted
respectively     by the symbols Kirhkl and mrhkl.
  The tetartohedral          form     irMl         cannot obviously exist        ;    and     it   is
easily seen that the form kkMcI                    is   included in Kirhkl.          Hence     the

only tetartohedral forms      are inrhkl and mrhkl,      —i.e., they   are all  de
rived from the hemihedral         forms with parallel faces.
   Also mrhkl can only exist when all the indices h, k, I are finite, and
mrhkl can only exist when all the indices are finite or one zero.
   When hkl    are   all finite, inrhkl consists of any pair of parallel
faces of the form hkl and Kirhkl of any pair of inclined faces of the
form hkl.    When one of the indices is zero, inrhkl consists of any
single face of the form hkl.
   13.  Hemihedral forms with inclined faces, derived from                      the
rhombohedron or scalenohedron, have only been observed in                       the
following minerals,   —
                               Cronstedtite.
                               Phenakite.

                               Quartz.
                               Tourmaline.
   In  these minerals     alone, therefore,       do the tetartohedral      forms
Kirhkl occur.
   Hemihedral forms with parallel faces, derived from the                scaleno
hedron, have only been observed in the following minerals,               —
                               Dolomite.

                               Phenakite.
The tetartohedral      forms    mrhkl     occur,    therefore,    only in    these
minerals.
    Hemihedral forms with parallel faces, derived from scaleno-
hedra, occur also in apatite. But in this mineral, two scalenohedra,
inverse with respect to each other, always occur together on the
same specimen,      and when one scalenohedron              is hemihedral      the
other is so also.    Hence the hemihedral forms in this mineral               cor
respond to hemihedral       and not to tetartohedral          forms in the pris
matic system.

to    60°.

8.   Preliminary Note on the Connection between the Form
    and Optical Properties of Crystals.             By Alfred K. Catton,
    B.A., F.C.P.S., Scholar of St John's College, Cambridge.
   1.   It is the object of this note to give an account of the results
of investigations,    which have had for their object the discovery of
the connection     between the form and optical properties of crystals.
   It  is believed that in the results      here given, some of the prin
cipal difficulties of this important      problem have been overcome.
   2.   The first step towards the solution of this problem was made
by Sir David Brewster in 1818. He discovered that crystals be
longing to the prismatic, oblique, and anorthic systems, are biaxal;
those belonging to the pyramidal and rhombohedral systems uniaxal,
while crystals of the cubic system do not possess double refraction
(a fact which had been previously stated by Hauy).
   In the prismatic system, the optic axes always            lie in a plane
containing two of the crystallographic axes, and make equal angles
with each of these axes.
   Now the theoretical        investigations of Fresnel have shown that
the oj)tic axes lie in a plane containing the axes of greatest and
least elasticity, and make equal angles with each of these axes.
   llence it follows, that, in the prismatic system, the       axes of elas
ticity coincide with the crystallographic axes.
   In the oblique    sy.stem,   one axis of elasticity coincides with that
crystallographic axi* which is       at  right angles to each of the other
two.

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1863-64.                              243
    In  the anorthic system, the            position of the axes of elasticity is
 subject to no known law.
    3. These facts      show that there is a fundamental            connection     be
 tween   crystalline form and optical properties.             Of late, nevertheless,
many eminent physicists,            following the views of De Senarmont, have
doubted the       existence of such a connection.              We shall, therefore,
show    hereafter     that the experiments           of De Senarmont       as well as
those    of Des Cloizeaux are              not at all opposed to, but important
confirmations       of, the views here adopted, which are founded on the
facts stated     above, and in addition on the remarkable relations that
have been      observed between hemihedral            forms and rotatory polarisa
tion in quartz, and dextro-             and laevo- tartaric acids.
   4.  In this note we shall consider in detail the connection between
the form      and optical       properties of crystals     belonging to the pris
matic system.          For crystals belonging to the oblique and anorthic
systems,   the investigation is still in progress.
   5.  We proceed to consider the following problem.
   "
      Given the angular elements of a crystal belonging to the pris
matic   system, to find the angle between the optic axes."
   We have         before observed,         that, in the    prismatic    system,   the
optic   axes     always lie in a plane containing two of the crystallo
graphy axes, and make equal angles                  with each of these axes.
   First, let the optic          axes lie in the plane containing the para
meters c   and a, and each make an angle                 w<  with the axis    c.   Our
object is  to find an expression            for some function of      uc, say tan   <oc,
in terms    of the parameters           a, 6, c.
   Now crystals        belonging to the pyramidal system have only one
optic axis, which coincides with the axis c, if a = b.                 Hence, when
a = 6, the        angle which each optic axis makes with the axis c
vanishes    ;   or, in other words, both optic axes coincide                 with  the
axis c.
   Hence,     a,c  and  .\  tan   o,< vanishes when a =       b.
                           .-.  tan  o)< is divisible by a  — b.

   6.  In  an abstract         of a paper on the                            System,
published     in the present number of the " Proceedings," it is shown
that the   crystals hitherto included in the rhombohedral system are
 merely the      particular forms which crystals of the prismatic system
 assume when        one angular element is equal to 60°.

   But crystals belonging to the rhombohedral system have only
one optic axis, and this, as is shown in the paper referred to, coin
cides with the axis c if the angular element 100, 110 = 60° ; i.e., if
a        —

    Hence when a                    = b      V3, the angle which each optic axis                                    makes
with the axis             c    vanishes.
    Hence,         me   and         .\   tan     <ae vanishes             when a=b           VS.

    But      we have before shown that                                it is divisible by a             — b.

    But all uniaxal crystals belong either to the pyramidal or                                                       rhom
bohedral systems.
   Hence these are the only factors containing a and                                                     b,   by which
tan <o, is divisible.

    But when this is the                                   case,   by the same reasoning                      as    before,

    Hence the expression                                  for tan     a,„    in terms of            o, b, c, must be a
fraction,          the denominator                          of which contains                the factors          b — c and
b — c    V3    ;    and, for the same reason as before, these are the only
factors in the denominator                                  containing       b   and    c.
    Hence, since tan                      u),   is of no dimensions,               the expression for tanu,
in terms of             o, b, c, must be                    of the form

where C is independent                               of o and       b,     and   A of    6   and c.
    8.Crystals belonging to the cubic system do not possess double re
fraction ; in other words, they have an infinite number of optic axes.
    Hence, tan                <a,   ought to become indeterminate,                              when a        —   b=o and
b — c = o,         which is the                 case        with the above expression.
    9.We have shown from physical considerations, that the factors
a — b, and a — W3, must enter into the expression, for tan &,, at
least, to the first degree                            ;    there    is,    however, no physical               reason for

tion,      in some cases, without making any, or only slight changes,
in the      angular elements               ;       but in other cases it is necessary to make
considerable         changes.          It is          therefore important to consider whether
the     changes required               are greater than the possible                              errors in the
angular elements.
     19.    Now, the measurements                                 of the angles between the faces of
different         specimens        of the same mineral,                             by the same or by            dif
ferent observers, often vary very considerably,                                        sometimes as much as
1°    or 2°.       In Karstenite,                  for instance, the angle between the faces
of the form           110,     which               are truncated                by the face 010, is variously
stated as 96° 36'            or 98° 54', which differ by 2° 18'.                             This difference
is too      great to be ascribed to errors of observation.         only appears              It
possible to account                for these differences in the measurements of
the same or        of equally accurate observers, by supposing that the
angular        elements of a given mineral are liable to vary slightly in
different         specimens.           The question                       is,    to what causes   is    this varia
tion due       ?    Now, in isomorphous substances, the angular elements
often differ         by    a   degree or more.                              For instance, the angular            ele
ments        of the minerals isomorphous with Aragonite are, —
                                                                    100, 100                010, 011

      It   will    be observed that the                            angular elements of Alstonite differ
respectively         by 1°20',5 and                      2°       11' from those of Aragonite, those of
 the       other minerals differing                           by    less.         Now Alstonite may          be con
 sidered as        Aragonite, in which half the carbonate of lime                                       is   replaced
  by    carbonate      of baryta.                   Hence           we may say, that          when half the

   250                Proceedings       of the Royal      Society
   lime in Aragonite is replaced by baryta, the angular elements of the
   latter are altered from 583 5' and 40° 50' to 59° 25'-5, and 38°                 39'
   respectively.
      Reasoning of a similar kind may be applied in a number of other
   cases.
      Hence, we conclude that the angular elements of a mineral vary
  when the normal         constituents    are   replaced by isomorphous           sub
  stances.
      20. Again, all crystals, except those of the cubic system, expand,
   in general, differently in different directions under the action of
  heat.    This is always the case in crystals             belonging to the      priis-
  matic, oblique, and anorthic systems.
      Hence a change of temperature             alters the angles between the
  faces, and therefore the angular elements, of crystals belonging                   to
  these systems, and the angular            elements     will in general      be per
  manently    altered   if the  temperature be sufficiently         raised.
      Hence the angular elements of a mineral               depend upon the tem
  perature to which it is or has been exposed.
      21. We conclude, therefore, that the angular                elements,   instead
 of being constant in all specimens of the same mineral, vary within
 narrow limits, according to the amount of isomorphous replace
 ment and the temperature to which it is or has been exposed;*                    and
 further,   that the amount of this           variation is quite as great as the
 differences which must be made in the angular                   elements, given in
 Miller's " Mineralogy," in order to make the calculated agree                   with
 the observed angle between the optic axes.                 It  is possible that,   iD
 a number     of   cases, the angular      elements of the crystal employed
     * Many apparent cases of dimorphism may possibly bo hence explained.
 Thus, Aragonite is not pure carbonate of lime, but is always associated with
 variable quantities of the carbonates of strontia, lead, or manganese.        Calcite
 sometimes contains     a considerable   quantity   of foreign   substances, —such  as
 protocarbonate of iron, oxide of zinc, &c.      Hence,  if isoruorphous replacement
 produces changes in the angular elements, these differences in the composition
of Calcite and Aragonite would be sufficient to account for the differences in
their angular elements (supposing them both referred to the prismatic system).
Graphite sometimes contains as much as 10 per cent, of iron ; titanic acid is
always associated    in anatoso, rutile, and brookite, with variable quantities     of
sesquioxido of iron.     Differences in the angular elements may also be due to
differences in the temperature at which the crystals were formed.

  for determining         the angle between the optic axes, were, from the
  causes    mentioned, different from those given by Professor                   Miller.
      22. But   if  the angular elements of a mineral vary within certain
  limits,   the angle between the optic                 axes, calculated     by the for
  mulae   given      in this note, must also vary within corresponding
 limits.  *
     The causes,        therefore,      which produce in          a given  mineral the
 variations in the angle between the optic axes are the same as
 those which produce the variations                in the angular elements.          That
 the angle between the optic axes               of  a  crystal varies by isomorphous
 replacement, is established by the experiments of De Senarmont;f
that it varies with the temperature to which the crystals are or
 have been exposed, is established               by those of Des Cloizeaux.J
     The existence of this variation, therefore, far from being opposed
to the      existence       of   a connection       between the form and optical
properties      of crystals,      as argued by De         Senarmont,§ is strongly in
support      of it.
     23. Suppose       that from either of the           causes   mentioned,   the para
meters a, 6, c, become a + x, b + y, c + z, where x, y, z, are small quan
tities.      Let the optic axes lie in the plane              ca, and make an angle a
with the axis c, and let             J  be the angle       corresponding    to the new
parameters.          It  is easily seen that

     Hence,    if 100, 110 be nearly 45° or 60°, and x—y not very small
in    the    former     case,     nor   x-y^'S in        the latter,   while 010, 011
differs considerably           from 45° or 60°,         tan a'   - tan a will be large.
In this     case, therefore,        the angle between the optic axes will vary
considerably.

                                         .     For the existence of this factor no d priori phy
sical reason can be assigned.                                        Now   c   - o represents           an   iufinite     plane,
containing the crystallographic axes a and b, and tan ac vanishes
when c = o.  The physical interpretation of this factor therefore
is,   that such an infinite plane has only one optic axis which coin
cides with the axis                            c.     We may compare this result with the fact,
that   if      a    ray of light                is   incident on crystal of the prismatic system,

          9.    A Contribution to the History of the Oxides of
                     Manganese.   By W. Dittmar, Esq.
     It    is   known that oxides of manganese, when ignited in air, either
absorb or lose oxygen,         until they attain the composition expressed
by the             formula Mn3           04.    Schneider        found       that when they        are
heated in pure oxygen,                    they leave the oxide Mn2 03.
     This latter result             is    not what one might have expected, for                    we
know  of no positive action exerted on manganese oxides or on pure
oxygen by nitrogen.    Thus air should act like dilute oxygen, pro
ducing the same oxide.
     To explain            Schneider's         result,    we      must       suppose     either   that
artificial oxygen differs from that contained in air, or, what is more
likely, that the amount of oxygen    which any given quantity of
manganese can take up when heated in       depends not only on theit,
temperature, but also on the tension the oxygen employed. of
     If,   then,     it   is   true, that at     a   red heat, in presence of oxygen of
the    tension        of one atmosphere, Mn2                03   is   a   stable compound, while
the       same    oxide, exposed to the same temperature in presence of
oxygen          of the tension of one-fifth of an atmosphere, reduced to                is
Mn3 04, the question            naturally arises, What oxides will be formed
in    presence        of oxygen of different tensions from those two above
mentioned           ?   Is there continuous series of oxides corresponding
                                         a
lo   a     continuous          series of oxygen-tensions                  under which they have
been       formed     ?
     These questions              seemed       investigation, especially
                                               to me to merit
as    their results would form an addition to our very imperfect know
ledge          of the influence of physical conditions on chemical reactions.
     Iu the first series of experiments, pure peroxide of manganese,
in    a porcelain or platinum boat, was placed in      porcelain tube,          a
kept       at   a   bright red heat, while            a   current         of nitrogen    or oxygen,
or    of       a   mixture of these two              gases,      was passed         over it.      The

    256                  Proceedings       of the Boyal     Society
    resulting oxide was weighed and analysed by determining the
    quantity of protoxide it yielded when heated in a current of
    hydrogen.        Most of the experiments were carried on under ordi
    nary atmospheric pressure ; but in a few cases, the tension of the
   gas was made less than one atmosphere by connecting the exit                    end
   of the porcelain tube with            a large  bell-jar, within which the     pres
   sure was diminished, and kept constant by means of an air-pump.
       Eighteen experiments gave the following results.
       In all   cases, either   black Mn2     03, or brown Mn3 04 was obtained         ;
   11o  intermediate oxides were formed.
       In all  the cases in which Mn3 0, was obtained, the partial tension
   of the oxygen lay between 0 and 021 atmospheres (the latter
   tension being that of the oxygen              of the atmosphere).       In all  the
   experiments       in which Mn,       03 was   obtained,   the partial tension of
  the oxygen lay between 0-25 and one atmosphere.
      Oxygen tensions intermediate between 021 and 0-25 did not
  occur in the series ; but in spite of this gap, the results obtained
  render    it highly probable that the function expressing the relation
  between the composition of an oxide of manganese which is formed
  at a red heat in an atmosphere of oxygen, aud the tension of that
  oxygen      is discontinuous,       so that   Mna03 is formed whenever           the
  tension exceeds, and         Miij  04 whenever     it is  below a certain   definite
  limit.
      To determine whether such            a point of discontinuity really exists,
 and     if so,   its position,    a   second series of experiments was per
 formed, which were made as uniform, and therefore                      comparable,
 as possible.        In all  cases, the Mn       Oa was    heated in mixtures of
 nitrogen      and oxygen       of exactly     known composition,        kept at, or
 very near to, the tension of the surrounding atmosphere.                   The  per
centages of oxygen in those mixtures were so chosen as gradually
 to inclose the value sought for           within narrower and narrower limits
 In   each experiment,        the height of the barometer was determined,
in order to know exactly the partial tension of the oxygen in the
mixture.
     Eleven experiments          were     made in all.      In eight, the oxides
obtained were either pure Mn,Oa, or Mn3Or                    In three, the oxides
were obtained together, not mixed, but as it were side by side,
aud occupying         different ports of the boat.       In those  cases,  in which

 Jln304 was obtained        alone, or at least in which        it predominated,
 the  partial tension of the oxygen (when measured by the height of
 the  equivalent column of mercury) did not exceed 7•07 inches.
    In those cases in which Mn2             03 was obtained,     or at least pre
 dominated,    the partial      tension    of the oxygen was equal to, or
greater    than,  6-9    inches.     Thus the point of discontinuity lies
between the two      limits    6-9 and 7 07 inches.
    Within these two tensions, sometimes the one and sometimes
the other oxide was obtained.             This fact does not speak, however,
against the existence       of  some definite     point of discontinuity,   as the
composition    of the resulting oxide depends on the temperature at
which    the experiment        is performed, as well as the tension of the
oxygen     employed.        A diminution of         temperature    is probably   of
the same effect as an increase           in the tension of the oxygen, and
vice versa.    Thus,    if the tension of the oxygen in a given mixture
of that gas and     nitrogen is just equal to that corresponding            to the
point   of discontinuity, for       a definite    temperature   t, a  temperature
slightly above that        will  cause   the formation     of Mn3     04, and one
slightly below will produce Mn2 03.
                             I
   In one experiment succeeded in producing the two oxides by
means     of the  same      mixture of nitrogen         and oxygen,      only the
tension   being slightly varied.          Mn2  O.,,  heated in this mixture at
the atmospheric        pressure of      29-9   inches,   remained      unchanged,
while at    the tension of       29-5  it  was   reduced to Hn3 04.        This is
quite   within the limit of ordinary barometrical variations.
 10.  Notice of Glacial Clay, with Arctic Shells, near Errol, on
        the Tay.       By the Rev. Thomas Brown, F.R.S.E.
   The author referred to the paper on the              Elie Glacial Clay, with
 Shells, read by   him    on the 2d    of March 1863.      During the succeed
ing summer he learned from            Dr M'Baiu, that shells had       been found
in  a brickfield near Errol, but       so  badly preserved, that none of the
species   had been determined.           During the autumn, while staying
in the neighbourhood        of Perth, he took occasion to visit the Errol
brickfield, and found that the shells, which occur in considerable
abundance, are precisely        the same group with those at Elie.            The
Wa     trutuMta, for example, which is the characteristic             shell of the

258                  Proceedings      of   the   Royal Society
deposit at Elie,       is yet more abundant           at Errol, along with the
Pectcn Greenland icus,         and most of the peculiar Arctic              shells of
the deposit.      Some interesting additions to the           list of Arctic  species
were obtained        at Errol.     The skeleton of         a seal was also found      ;
but the description          of these fossils, as well as the observations
made on the nature of the deposit and its stratigraphical relations,
were reserved for a future occasion.              The author merely wished to
direct attention to the fact, that thoso glacial clay beds of the Forth
are found also in the        Tay.
11.     Notes on the Boulder-Clay at Greenock and Port-Glas
     gow.      By the Rev. R. Boog Watson, B.A., F.R.S.E.,
     Hon. Mem. Nat. Ver. Liineburg.
.    In Greenock, excavations have lately            been made       for a new  gaso
meter.       The works      are   now completed, but the superintendent,             a
most intelligent man, took me to the place, and told me what they
had found in the course of digging.
     The site of the excavation          is close to the shore, and very little
above the tide-mark.
     At the south-east corner of the works,           i.e., most remote from the
sea,    the workmen        reached    the rock at a depth            of 20 feet.    It
was     a soft shale, and       I  could    not ascertain       that any   striatums
were observed on        it.    Probably there were none preserved on such
 material.      Its upper surface      was flat.     Towards       the sea, or north
and west, the rock sloped downwards                 very steeply, and       this  sea
 ward face was covered by a great bed or bank of sand, that sloped up
 from the edge of the rock, and as it receded rose higher as a bank.
     The flat surface of the rock         was covered by from 6 to 12 inches
 of   a fine soft clay  without stones.         I could not learn whether this
 clay overlay or dipped under the sand-bank,                 or whether    it simply
 disappeared altogether         at the edge of the rock, where the sand
  bank began.       The last alterant ive      seems the most probable.
      Above   the clay lay from 18 to 20 feet of boulder-clay,                a little
  thinner, of course, over the back of the sand -bank.                  The boulder-
  clay was dark in colour, sandy, and full of striated stones, some of
 which     were  of considerable     size — in short, exactly similar to what
 we have at      Leith and Newhaven.

                     of Edinburgh,       Session 1863-64.                       259
    The interest    of this section lies in the fact of its proving, that
the   boulder-clay in this case was deposited in water.                This is ob
vious, not only from       the sedimentary        character    of the underlying
clay and sand,      with which the boulder-clay is here associated, but
also from    the soft nature and exposed condition of these underly
ing beds which could not possibly have resisted the pressure                 of ice.
The boulder-clay seems here, therefore,              to have been dropped from
under the edge       of the ice-cake covering of our land just where it
began to float at the shore line, and thus             quietly to have buried the
true   marine deposits now underlying it.
    Another locality, where       I recently examined the boulder-clay,            is
in the     cutting of the New Wemyss Bay Railway, where it                       ap
proaches its junction with the present Greenock Railway, just                     be
low   Port-Glasgow.        The new railway cutting here runs at            a height
of 60 feet above the sea,       along the edge of the         steep slope, the base
of which is the flat known         as the 40-foot sea-beach.          The old rail
 way   runs here along this flat       ;  and   it was in this neighbourhood
that    the shell-bed described by Mr Smith of Jordauhill occurs in
a bed     of sand overlying the boulder-clay.                 The boulder-clay is
somewhat        redder, but otherwise       exactly like that in the railway
 cutting which is now being made between Newhaven                        and Leith.
 It  is dark,     sandy, and    full of striated stones.          Through it there
 runs    horizontally    a   well marked       stratum    of fine sand and clay
 about two inches       thick, which     I traced for several yards,      till it was
 lost in the debris     of the cutting       In  the midst of this boulder-clay
 at a  height of about 60 feet above the sea,                I  found several frag
 ments    of shells, one or two of which        seemed to belong to an astarte ;
 the others were unrecognisable.              Under the boulder-clay the rock
 has been     laid bare, and both its seaward face and upper surface aro
  well   seen.    It is a coarse sandstone ; its upper surface is very
  strongly striated and well rounded.
     Here then,      as in   the former      case, we have evidence         that the
  boulder-clay was deposited in the sea.            It  was land ice which formed
  the materials    of the boulder-clay,     and consolidated them by its pres
  sure.    This is now generally admitted, but the presence of the shells
  and  the existence of the stratum of sand and clay indicate that these
  materials    were deposited      on a surface        covered    by the sea.     But
  there are    indications here of a still          more interesting fact.        The

260                  Proceedings         of the Royal      Society
steep bank or       cliff which pretty generally along our coasts                        rises
from a flat elevated about 40 feet above the sea, has always                             been
spoken of as a beach formed              by the sea, and not a few calculations
have been made to determine from a comparison with our existing
sea-beach the length of time during which the sea must have stood
at the higher level, in order to its having eroded our land in the
very     marked    way which the upper or 40- foot terrace                    presents.
But plainly, before any such calculations                 are legitimate,     it ought
to be proved that the 40-foot terrace is really the work of the                           sea.
Now, this seems to have been somewhat hastily assumed.                              Unde
niably, the     sea does act powerfully on the shore, cutting out a step
or forming a       beach line along its margin ; further, it is obvious,
that that margin was at one time 40 feet higher along our                           coasts
than now, and the inference has been jumped at, that the terrace
which does certainly exist at that level was formed by the                        sea.     In
other words, a connection  of proximity between the sea and                               the
40-foot terrace being proved, the connection of cause and effect                          has
been assumed.  But is the assumption legitimate ? Now this cutting
at Port-Glasgow shows that the 40-foot terrace exists not merely
on the external surface, but in the rock beneath.                       The superficial
deposits are merely the clothing of a rocky skeleton beneath, and
the terrace which we can trace on the surface, we find existing in
the rock below.         What then gave its form             to   that rocky skeleton
below?       Was the         sea the    agent    which cut       the    terrace     there?
Plainly not, for when the              sea beat on the shore        40 feet   above its
present level, the rock, in its present form, was buried even deeper
than now under that mass of boulder-clay which still covers                         it,   and
which the     sea, at   this particular spot at least, and at many                 others,
was not able      to penetrate.      But was the boulder-clay already there?
Admitting what          is   obvious, that      if
                                              there,  alone and not the un
                                                          it
derlying rock could           be fashioned       by the sea,     are we sure that           it
really was already deposited, or may              it   not rather      have been depo
sited at the very time we are speaking of, when the land in its up
ward progress      still stood    40 feet lower than now         ?
  Now, of this earlier presence of the boulder-clay we have abundant
proof.      The rock surface here and elsewhere on our coasts                 is   sharply
striated.  The striating agent,       now generally admitted, was
                                            it   is
land ice in the form of   thick glacier cake, grinding downwards,
                                a

                        of Edinburgh,             Session 1863-64.                       261
and     pressing outwards             towards      the sea.      This glacier cake must
have been   slowly floated off by the gradual subsidence of the land.
As it floated off the bouldeT-clay was deposited under the edge of
the ice-foot on the           freshly striated       surface of the rock, protecting
it at once from the action  of the surf, consolidated under the pres
sure of the ice-cake, but showing traces in its shells and its strati
fied layers of the presence of the sea.   There on the surface of the
rock the   boulder-clay has rested throughout the long period during
which    the land subsided to a depth of 1500 or 1700 feet or more,
and again re-emerged                till it   approached,      under      an ever softening
climate and      with      a more temperate fauna, to almost                its present level.
  In short, the 40-foot beach terrace                  owes     its configuration      not so
much to the       external action of the             sea,   as to the      internal contour
of the rock.         That contour         was derived from         the grinding agency
of the ice-cake       covering, and between the period when that contour
was   given to    it,   and the presence of the sea at the 40-foot beach -
line, there     have intervened all the countless                 ages,    with their mani
fold changes,        of the subsidence and re-elevation of our land.

264                Proceedings      of the Royal      Society
                     Monday, 5th December 1864.
His Grace the Duke of Argyll, at the request of the Council,
          delivered the following Opening Address                  : —
In opening this Session of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,                 at the
close of my tenure of the Presidency,            I  must express my sincere
regret on account of the small amount            of attendance which it       has
been  in my power     to give.   I  can only assure you that,     if  I  had had
the opportunity,    my attendance would have been far more regular                ;
und that    nothing but the impossibility of reconciling this with
other duties has prevented my occupying this chair as often as the
honour you have done me, and not less my own inclination, would
have led me to do.
   During the years which have elapsed since            I first had the honour
of addressing you from this chair, science has been enriched by
an  accumulated      store of facts in many branches           of inquiry,    and
by not a few of those discussions which so often promote, quite                 as
much as actual discovery,         the advance of knowledge.             Our   own
Society has not been       idle.   Valuable papers have been communi
cated on a great variety of subjects       ; and when we look, not merely
at the number and        variety of these, but at the detailed character        of
many of them, and remember the number                  of Societies which      are
specially devoted      to special subjects,   it is impossible not to be im
pressed with the immense scope, as        well as with the laborious minute
ness,  of modern investigation.         But, divided and subdivided as the
natural sciences have come to        be, they   all touch each other at innu
merable points   ;  and there are some questions touching the shadowy
line that connects rather than separates the physical and the meta
physical, on which almost all the sciences are found to have a
common, and often an unexpected            bearing.      Such, for example,       is
the subject with which Geology, and Palaeontology,               and Compara
tive Anatomy, and Archaeology, and the mental sciences, have all
been    of late years     so  busy,   and on which different          schools of
thought are now disputing every inch of ground.                 That subject is
the history of Organic Life ; and the question, whether in that

                             of Edinburgh,                   Session 1864-65.                                   265
history we can trace anything beyond a series of disconnected facts,
—anything in the nature of                             a   Law.
      I    propose in this paper to make some observations upon this sub
ject, in two of its most general aspects —
      1.    Upon the idea of "Creation by Law," how we should                                                 define
it,   and in what            light     we should regard it.
      2.    On the bearing                 which existing theories                  on the " Origin of
Species"              have upon our knowledge                         and conception          of Creation           by
Law.
      The word " Law"                 is   very often so loosely used that                    it   is   absolutely
necessary             to begin any discussion                     on this subject by defining the
sense in          which     it   is   to be understood.                  Much dispute, in science                   as
well as in other matters, may often be avoided by                                         a    simple defini
tion.         If Law        be understood to mean                       nothing more than an " ob
served order              of facts," there need                  be   no discussion at all on " Crea
tion        by   Law."       There can                 be no doubt whatever               that there           is   an
"   observed           order" in the forms of organic life.                          They are all allied
to each other after an order and gradation which                                    is   as certain as         it   is
mysterious.               But, assuredly, this                   is   not the sense in which creation
                                                           by    some, and as jealously contested
by by
        law      is   so eagerly affirmed
           others.
                          " Law,"          however,          generally         means not           merely          the
"observed order of facts," but some Force which                                          is    its compelling
cause.            Force     is   the root idea of Law in its scientific sense.                                  The
law ofgravitation, which   the purest example,   not merely the
                                                  is                                     is
"observed order" in which the heavenly bodies move, but     the                                          it   is
force which          compels those movements, and (in      sense) explains           a
them.            The difference between " law" in the narrower, and "law"
                                                                         " Three
in    the        larger    sense,      may be roughly illustrated by the
special Laws" discovered by Kepler, as compared with the one
universal Law discovered by Newton. The Three Laws of Kepler
                              " an observed order of facts,"                                            in respect
were        simply and purely
to the           planetary orbits.                They stood            by   themselves— disconnected
—their cause unknown.                         But the higher law discovered by Newton
                                              and their cause. The
                                                                      " observed order"
revealed          their connection
which         Kepler had discovered                        was   simply      a   necessary consequence
of      the law        of gravitation.             In its light,             the   three laws of .Kepler
have been             merged and lost.
    It      is   true, indeed,             that    Law, in the narrower                       sense,     suggests

266                     Proceedings               of the Boyal Society
and implies the existence of Law in the wider sense.                                            An    observed
order of facts — assuming,                       of course, that the order is constant
under the same conditions — implies the action of some force of
which that order is the index and the result.                                                But the        mere
general      idea that some force is at the bottom of all phenomena
which are invariably consecutive, is a very different thing from
knowing what that force   in respect to the rule or measure of its
                                           is,
operation.         It    is,    indeed,          the   great        object of pure                  science, to
ascertain the measures of force.                        Mr Lewes, in the very curious                           and
interesting work which he has lately published on the philosophy
of Aristotle, has maintained that the knowledge of measure — or
what he calls the "verifiable                         element" in our knowledge                       —    is   the
element which determines whether any theory belongs to science,
or to metaphysics          ;     and that any theory may be transferred                                     from
metaphysics        to science, or from science to metaphysics, simply                                            by
the addition or withdrawal of its                         " verifiable element."                      In   illus
tration of this he says, that    we          if          withdraw the formula " inversely
as the square of the distance, and directly                             as the mass,"           from the law
of universal attraction, "     becomes   it                    pure metaphysics."*                     If      this
means that, apart from ascertained numerical relations, our concep
tion of law loses all reality and distinctness,  do not agree                   I                                in
the position.   think the idea of natural forces
                I                                  quite separate                       is
from any ascertained measurement of their energy        that, for                               ;
example, the knowledge that all the particles of matter exert an
attractive    force upon each other,                     is,   so   far   as   it   goes, true physical
knowledge, even though we did not know the farther truth that this
force acts according to the numerical                           rule ascertained                by Newton.
That matter attracts matter                      isa   definite         idea, — although             it   is   less
definite,    or less complete than the idea that the measure of that
               " directly as the mass, and inversely as the
attraction    is                                            square of
the distance."    This undoubtedly the highest, or perhaps ought
                                  is                                                                 I
to  say,  the ultimate, conception of       scientific " law," — force
                                                                    a
ascertained according to some method and measure of its operation.
   But now     we must go              a    step farther.               What      is    force   ?     What       is
our conception of         it   ?       What idea can            we form,            for example, of             the
real nature of that force, the measure of whose operation has been
                         *     Aristotle.        By G.   II.   Lewes.          P. 84.

                         of Edinburgh,          Session 1864-65.               .                   267
bo   exactly ascertained           — the    force of gravitation ?            It         is invisible,
— imponderable.              All    our words     for it are but circumlocutions
to express         its phenomena           or its effects.    There are many kinds
of force       in nature — which        we   distinguish after the            same fashion          —
according       to their effects, or according to the forms of matter in
which they become cognisable                   to us.   But   if   we trace up our con
ceptions on the nature              of force to their fountain-head,                 we shall pro
bably find      that they are connected, more or less directly, with our
own       consciousness of living effort, — of that force which has its
seat      in our own vitality, and especially            with that kind of it which
can be      called forth at the bidding of the will.  If we can ever
know       anything of the nature of any force, it ought to be of this
one.       And yet the fact is that we know nothing.                      The vital forces
which work in our organisation,                  work, for the most part, entirely
independent of our will, and even of our consciousness.                                     Those of
them      which are at the bidding of will are subject to it only through
an     elaborate machinery ; and if that machinery be damaged, we
know too often, by sad experience,                that their connection with the will
is broken.         If,   then, we know nothing of that kind of force which is
bo   near us, and with which our own intelligence                       is,   so to speak, in
such close       alliance, much less can we know the ultimate nature of
force in       its other fofms.       I    dwell on this because       I      think that both
the aversion       with which some men regard the idea of creation                                  by
Law, and the eagerness with which some others hail                                 it,   are founded
on   a    notion, that when we have traced any given                           phenomena            to
what are called natural forces, we have traced them farther than
we     really have.          We know nothing of the ultimate seat of force.
Science,       in the modern doctrine of the Conservation
                                                     of Energy and
Convertibility of Forces,    already getting something like
                                       is                      firm                            a
hold of the idea, that all kinds of force are but forms and mani
festations     of some one central force, issuing from some one fountain-
head       of power.  Sir John Herschel has not hesitated to say, that
"    it   is   but reasonable        to regard     the force of gravitation as the
direct or      indirect result of      a   consciousness, and      a   Will existing           some
where."*         And even       if   we cannot assume that force,             in all its forms,
is     due to the        direct working of the Creator,                at least let us not
                         *   Outlines of Astronomy.     3d ed. p. 265.

268                          Proceedings          of the lioyal          Society
assume the contrary,               — let     us not speak or          think     as       if   the forces        of
nature were either independent of, or even separate from, His power.
The idea of Creation by Law leaves these questions exactly where
it found them.  It has no adverse bearing on theology; and those
who prize it under the notion that it has this bearing, as well as
those who dread                it on the same account,                   are equally forgetful                  of
what " Law," in               a scientific     sense, must be defined to be.
    Hut there is still another                    sense      in which the word                    "Law"         is
habitually used in science ; and this is perhaps the most common
and the most important of all.   It is used to designate not merely
an observed order              of facts — not the bare abstract idea of force — not
mere individual forces, according to ascertained measures                                          of   opera
tion — but forces             as combined          with each other, and fitted to                         each
other for the attainment of special ends.                                 The whole science                     of
mechanics,          for example,              deals      with      Law in this                sense— with
natural forces           as related to purpose                and subservient                 to intention.
And here         we     come upon " Law
                                        " in                      a sense     which is more                   per
fectly intelligible to us than in any other ; because, although                                                we
know nothing of the nature of force, even of that force which                                                   is
resident in ourselves, we do know for what ends we exert                                                it,   and
what    is   the " law" governing our devices for its                         use.        That law        is   —
combination  for the accomplishment of purpose.    The universal
prevalence of this idea in nature    indicated    the irresistible
                                                            is                      by
tendency which we observe in the language of science to personify
the forces, and the combinations                            of force, to which all natural
phenomena           are in         the      first instance         due.        It    is       a   great       in
justice, too often committed, to suspect scientific men of unwill
ingness to accept the idea of    personal Creator, merely because
                                                   a
they try to keep separate the language of science from                                                        the
language of theology. The separation may sometimes be                                                         due
to such       unwillingness, but quite as often — hope much oftener   I
— it   is    a  separation which      maintained for other and better
                                                  is
reasons.         But    it    is   curious        to observe how              the    attempt            breaks
down,   — that         is,   how impossible            it   is,   in describing physical                  phe
nomena,        to    avoid       the     phraseology             which identifies them with
the phenomena                of mind, and           is   moulded         on    our own conscious
personality         and will.          It    is   impossible        to    avoid          this language,
simply       because         no other       language conveys              the impression                which

  innumerable      structures    leave     upon   the   mind.       Take, for       ex
 ample, the     word " Contrivance."           How could science do without
 it?    How could the great subject of animal mechanics                       be dealt
 with    scientifically  without continual reference to Law               as that    by
 which, and through         which, special organs are formed for the doing
 of special     work.     What      is the very definition        of    a machine ?
 Machines do not increase force, they only adjust                    it.    The very
 idea   and essence      of  a machine      is that it is a contrivance         for the
distribution of force with a view to its bearing on special purposes.
A man's arm is a machine in which the law of leverage is supplied
hy the    vital force for the purposes of prehension.             A   bird's wing is
a   machine in which         the same law is supplied,          under most com
plicated conditions,       for the purposes of      fight.     It is impossible to
describe the facts we meet           with in this or in any other branch of
science,    without investing the laws of nature with something of that
personality which they do actually reflect, or without conceiving
of them      as partaking of those attributes of mind which we every
where    recognise in their working and results.              If any one imagines
that the idea       of Creation by Law casts out the idea of creation
under     the supreme control of purpose, let him read one of the
later works      of Mr Darwin, —        I  refer to his most curious work on
"
    The Fertilisation        of the Orchids."       In investigating          the laws
which      determine     the form and the propagation               of this strange
order    of plants, Mr Darwin finds it impossible to describe them
without exhausting all the forms of language in which we can
express     the workings of intention and of mind in the determina
tion   of physical results.
    I  am afraid that to         some     this discussion may, at first sight,
appear     irrelevant.      But  I  am sure this impression       will    be removed
in    those who       recollect    how    powerfully ambiguity of language
reacts upon the progress           of knowledge.        Words which should            be
the servants       of thought      are   too often its masters    ;  and    I  know of
no word      which has been used more ambiguously, and therefore more
injuriously, than the word Law."

when we pass, in its use, from one meaning                               to another.       There
are at least four different            senses    which must              be   carefully    distin
guished      —

                                                               "    an observed order of
             facts."
     2.   To that order      as   involving the action of some force or                    forces,
             of which nothing more may               be   known.
     3.   As applied to individual forces, the measure of whose                            opera
           tion has been more or less defined and ascertained.
     4. As applied         to those combinations            of force which have             refer

             function.
    Now, in which of these             senses    does      science       justify us in      enter
taining the idea          of "    Creation by    Law?"
    First, it is certain that there is          an   "    observed order
                                                                                          "
                                                                                  of facts both
in the organic and in the inorganic world.                     I
                                              mean to speak in this
paper of the organic world alone, and chiefly of those higher forms
which are the seat of animal life. In these there is an observed
order in the most rigid scientific sense, that                       — phenomena
                                                                   is,                     in uni
form connection,          and mutual relations which can be made, and                            are
made, the basis of systematic classification.                  These classifications             are
imperfect, not because they are founded on ideal connections where
none exist, but only because they fail in representing adequately the
subtle and pervading order which binds together                            all living things.
But the order which prevails              in the existing world                is   not the only
order which has been recognised by science.                          A like       order has pre
vailed through all the past history of creation.                         Nay, more     ;   it   has,
1   think,   clearly ascertained, not only that relations similar to
              been
those which now exist have existed always among all the animals
of each contemporary creation, but that order of     like kind has            a
connected with each other all the different creations which were
successively introduced.             In   almost      all the leading types of life
which have existed            in the different
                                      geological ages, there                                is   an
orderly gradation connecting the forms which were becoming                                       ex
tinct with the forms which were for the first time appearing in                                  the
world.       It   is   still disputed by some geologists,                 whether      we have

                       of Edinburgh,        Session 1864-65.                        271
certain evidence         that this gradation        has been the gradation         of  a
rising   scale — of     progressive     creations     from lower to higher types.
But this dispute is maintained only on the ground, that we cannot
safely trust to negative evidence.             It  is an unquestionable      fact, that
so far as    this kind of evidence can go, it              does  testify to the suc
cessive    introduction of higher and higher forms of Life.                        Very
recently,     a discovery     has been made, to which          Mr Darwin only a few
years ago        referred,   as
                                  " a discovery of which the chance is very
small," viz., of fossil           organisms    in beds far beneath the lowest
Silurian      strata.      This discovery       has been made          in Canada — in
beds   far down, near the bottom even, of the rocks hitherto termed
" Azoic." But what are the forms of life which have been found
here?      They belong to the very lowest of living types, — to the
"
   Rhizopods." So far as this discovery goes, therefore, it is in
strict  accordance with all the facts previously known, — that as we
go  back     in time, we lose, one after another, the higher and more
complex organisms,           —first,   the Mammalia;          then,  the Vertebrata;
and now        lastly, even the Mollusca. It is in accordance, too, with
another fact which has been observed before, viz., that particular
forms     of life have attained,         at particular epochs, a maximum de
velopment both in respect to size and distribution,                  — the  favourites
as  it were, of Creation for          a time.    These earliest Rhizopods seem
to have been         of enormous size and developed on an enormous scale,
since   there is good reason to believe that beds of immense thick
ness are composed           of their remains.           All that is   new in this dis
covery is the vast extension which              it gives in time to the same rules
which had been already traced through ages which we cannot num
ber.     The facts of creation,           therefore, do range themselves          in  an
observed       order, and in this sense, at least,         it may   be said with truth
that creation has been " by Law."
    And now we advance one step farther.                    Every observed order in
 physical phenomena             does suggest        irresistibly to the mind the
operation of some physical cause — the working of some force or
 forces,    of which nothing more may                   be known than these their
 visible effects.        This is the second of the four senses in which I
                       "        "
 have said that           Law is frequently used. We say of an observed
 order of facts that it must be due to some " Law," meaning simply
 that all order involves the idea of some arranging cause, the work-
     tol.   v.                                                              2 N

272                   Proceedings    of the Boyal        Society
ing of some force, whether it             be one which we can trace and de
fine or not.     In   these two senses, then, both somewhat vague, it can
not be doubted that Creation has been by Law.
   The next question, however, is the main one — Is the observed
order which prevails in nature, and especially in the organic world,
an order of which we can even guess the physical cause ? Is it an
order which contains within itself any indications of the force or
forces which have been concerned in producing                   it?
  In considering this question, there is one thing to                     be observed   at
the outset.      It   is certain that nothing is known           or has been          even
guessed at, in respect to the history and origin of Life, which cor
responds with Law in its strictest            and most definite              sense.     We
have no knowledge of any one or more forces — such                        as the force of
gravitation, or of magnetic attraction and repulsion — to which any
one of the phenomena of Life can be traced.        Far less have we
any knowledge    of any such laws which can be connected with
the successive creation or development of new organisms.       Pro
fessor Huxley, in a recent work,* has indeed spoken of " that com
bination of natural forces which we term              Life."     But this language
is purely rhetorical.       I   do not mean to say that               Life may not he
defined to be a kind of force, or a combination                      of forces. All I
mean    is,   that we know nothing of any of these forces in the same
sense in which we do know something of the force of gravity,
or of magnetism, or of electricity, or of chemical affinity. These
are all more or less known, not, indeed, in respect to their ultimate
nature, but in respect to certain methods and measures of their
operation.  No such knowledge exists in respect to any of the
forces which have been concerned in the development of Life. No
man has ever pretended          to get such       a   view of any of these as to
enable him to apply to them the instruments of his analysis, or to
trace in their working any of those definite                relations to space, or
time, or number, which are always                the ultimate quest of science,
and the discovery of which          is   her great reward.
  Since, then, laws, in this most definite              sense   of the word,          have
not been       discovered   in the existing phenomena,                    or in the past
history of organic life, let us look         a   little closer at the ideas which

                             of Edinburgh, Session 1864-65.                                       273
these phenomena                have suggested to the mind of those who have
speculated on the             origin and development of species.
     There is one idea which has been common                                to all theories            of
development,             and that     is the idea that ordinary generation                            has
somehow been producing,                   from time to time, extraordinary effects,
and that a new species           in fact, simply an unusual birth. It
                                      is,                                                              is
worthy      of observation, that the earlier forms in which the theory
of development appeared, did suggest something more nearly ap
proaching to        a     law of creation          in the later form
                                                than    is   contained
which      that theory has assumed in the hands of Mr Darwin.    The
essential       idea of the theory of development,                     in its earlier forms,
was,     that      modifications         of structure        arose    somehow             by way of
natural      consequence           from      the outward circumstances                    or physical
conditions, which required them, and from the living effort of organ
isms sensible           in some degree of that requirement.                     Now, inadequate
and even grotesque                though       this idea may          be as       explaining the
origin of new species,             it    cannot be denied, that            it   makes its appeal
to   a   process    which, at least to          a   limited extent, does operate in pro
ducing modifications              of organic structure.              For example, the            same
species     of mollusc          has often      a   shell comparatively            weak and thin,
or   a   shell comparatively                robust and strong,         according           as   it    lies
in   tranquil or in stormy water.                      The shell which               is   much        ex
posed      needs to be stronger               than the shell which              is   less exposed.
But the mere fact of the need cannot supply the thing needed, unless
by   the adjustment             of some machinery for the purpose.                          How the
vital forces        of the mollusc            can thus       be made to           work to order,
under      a    change of external conditions,                 we do not know.                  But    we
do know,           as    a   matter   of fact, that the shell               is    thickened           and
strengthened, according as                it  needs resisting power.              This result     does
not appear to arise' from any difference                     in the amount of lime held
in   solution    in the water, but upon some power in the secreting
organs     of the animal to appropriate more or less of according to              it,
its own need.         The effects of this power are seen where there                             is    no
difference       of condition except difference of exposure.    have                 I            seen

different sides of Plymouth breakwater,                      — the    sheltered side and the
exposed side.            The   same power          of adaptation      is   seen      in many other
forms.         Trees      which    are      most exposed to the blast are the most

 most developed.                   All       these results arise by way of natural                          conse
 quence.          How shall we describe them                         ?       Shall   we say that they are
 the result of Law ?                    We may safely do                 so, remembering               only that
 by Law, in this sense, we mean nothing but the co-operation of dif
 ferent natural          forces, which, under certain conditions, work together
 for the fulfilment of                  an obvious           intention.            Of the nature of          those
 forces      we    know nothing                    ;   nor is    it easy to conceive how                      they
 have been         so co-ordinated                     as to produce          effects fitting with            such
 exactness         into the conditions                       requisite        for the preservation               of
 organic      life.      If       there were any evidence that by the same                                  means
 new forms of life could be developed                                 from the old,             I    cannot     see
 why there should be any reluctance                                  to admit            the fact.     It   would
be different           from anything that we see                         ;   but     I    do   not know       that
it would          be    at    all more wonderful, or that it would briDg                                         us
much nearer than we now stand to the great mystery of creation.
I     look   upon       the adaptation                   and arrangement                  of natural        forces,
which can compass these modifications of animal structure, in exact
proportion to the need of them, as an adaptation and arrangement
which is in the nature of creation.                                   It      can only be due to the
working of         a power             which is in the nature of creative power.                               We
are    so accustomed                   to these and other similar phenomena,                                and to
hide our own ignorance of their cause, by describing                                            them as the
result of
          " Law," that                       we forget what a            multitude of natural               forces
must be concerned                  in their production,                  and what complicated                  ad
justments of these amongst each other for the accomplishment                                                     of
purpose.          It   is purely,              therefore, in my view,                    a question      of   evi
dence, whetherthis particular law of adaptation has or has not
been the means of introducing new forms of life.   There is no
evidence that it has.                    So far as we know, this power of self-adap
tation, wonderful                 as    it   is,   has   a   comparatively           limited application;
when that limit              is   outrun by changes in outward conditions,                                  which
are too great or too rapid, whole species die and disappear.                                             Never
theless, the introduction of new species to take the place of those
which have        passed          away,       is   a   work which has been not only so often,
but so continuously repeated, that                              it   suggests the idea of having
been    brought         about through the instrumentality of some natural
process.      But      we may say with confidence, that                              it    must have been

a    process different        from any that we yet know— a process not the
same as      that, obscure as this            is,   which produces the lesser modifi
cations of organic           forms.
    It    has not,  I     think, been sufficiently observed, that the theory of
Mr Darwin does not address itself to the same question, and does
not even       profess to trace the origin of new forms to any definite
law.       His theory gives an explanation, not of the processes by which
new       forms first appear, but only of the processes by which, when
they have appeared, they acquire                     a   preference over others, and thus
become      established in the world.                 A   new species       is,   indeed, accord
ing to his theory, as          well    as   with the older theories of development,
simply an       unusual birth.              The bond of connection                between allied
specific and         generic forms,          is   in his view simply the bond of in
heritance.          But Mr Darwin           does not pretend to have discovered any
law or     rule according to which new forms have been                             born from old
forms.       He does not hold that outward conditions, however changed,
are   sufficient to account for them.                    Still less     does he connect them
with the effort or aspirations         of any organism after new faculties and
                                                " our ignorunce of the laws of
powers.        He frankly       confesses that
variation      is   profound    ;"    and says, that in speaking of them as due
to              he means only
                                          " to acknowledge
                                                   plainly our ignorance
     chance,
of the      cause of each particular variation. "»    Again he says —
                                                                      "                               I
believe     in no law of necessary development."f This distinction be
tween  Mr Darwin's theory and other theories of development, has
not, Ithink, been sufficiently observed. His theory seems to be far
better than   mere theory — to be an established scientific truth —
                    a
in   so   far as    it   accounts, in part at least, for the success and estab
lishment and spread of new forms when they have arisen.                                But    it    does
not even suggest the law under                      which, or      by   which, or according to
which, such          new forms are introduced.                     Natural selection can do
nothing except with the materials presented to its hands.                                It    cannot
select except among the               things open to selection.              Natural selection
can originate         nothing   ;    it   can only pick out and choose among the
things which are            originated by some other law.                 Strictly speaking,
therefore,         Mr Darwin's theory               is   not   a   theory on the origin of
species at      all, but only        a    theory on the causes             which      lead     to the

relative success or failure of such new fomts as may be bora into
the world.            It   is the more important to remember this distinction,
because        it             Mr Darwin himself frequently forgets
                    seems to me that
it.    Not only does he speak of natural selection "producing" this
and that modification                        of structure, but             he undertakes       to affirm of
one class of changes that                            they can be produced,                and of another
class of changes that they cannot be produced, by this process.*
Now, what             are          the changes            for the preservation              of which         his
theory does, in some sense, account ?                                     They     are such changes, and
these only, as are of some direct                                    use    to the       organism     in the
"
     struggle for existence."                        Any change which has not this direct
value,        is     not       provided             for in the theory.   All structures,
therefore,          are    unaccounted                for — not only as respects their origin,
but even            as respects              their preservation — in which the variations
have no other value                         than mere beauty or variety.                     Accordingly,
Mr Darwin is tempted to deny that any such structures exist                                                   in
nature.        Now,        I   hold that any theory of which this denial is really
a necessary part, is self-condemned.                                     Yet   a theory may be good as
accounting           for the preservation                     of some structures, although it              fails
to account in this respect for others.                                   And   so the fact    that natural
selection cannot have operated on structures                                        of mere beauty          and
variety       is no proof              that        the theory            of natural selection is          false,
but only that it is incomplete.                                It   does not account        for the origin
of any structure               ;    and      it,   accounts for the preservation                of only       a
certain       number.Surely, then, Mr Darwin assigns to his "law"
of natural selection   range far wider than really belongs to when,                                 it,
on the strength of                  it, a   he denies that beauty for its own sake can                       be
an end or object                   in organic           forms.           He says — " This doctrine,          if
true, would be absolutely                           fatal to my theory."                 Why should        this
be    fatal    to his theory,                      except on the supposition                that    Natural
Selection gives            a   complete account both of the origin of new forms,
of which, in reality,    gives no account at all, and of their
                                       it                                                            preser
vation, of which     does give some account, but one which
                               it                                                                    is   only
partial   ?   I       dwell         on this, because                it   lies at the very root of the
question       how far             Mr Darwin's theory can                      be said    to suggest any
thing in the nature of                        a     creative        law of     a   kind to explain         the

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1864-65.                               277
 method which has been followed              in the introduction of new forms.
Let us test this question by bringing to bear upon                  it some particu
lar example       of specific variation.         I  select for this purpose one
example to       which my attention           has been     lately directed,      which
will illustrate     what    I   mean better than         any abstract discussion.
It  is the case    of the Humming-birds.
    This group of birds seems to me to exhibit, in the most striking
form, not a few       of those mysteries of creation which at once tempt
us to   speculate on the origin of species, and at the same time con
found every endeavour           to bring     it into relation with any process
which we know or can conceive.               In  the first place, they are sharply
defined from      all other forms in that class of the animal kingdom to
which they belong.           It is most difficult to say what is their nearest
affinity, and the nearest, when         it is found, is very distant. Secondly,
they are absolutely         confined to one continent of the globe.                  In
the   third place, the various           species as amongst           themselves    are
very closely     united, ranging indeed over a great variety of forms,
but for the most part connected with each other by very nice grada
tions. In the fourth place, there are, so to speak, some gaps in the
scale,   which suggest that some species have either been lost, or
have    not yet been discovered.            In the fifth place, each of these
species, however nearly         allied to some other, appears to be absolutely
fixed and constant,        there being not the slightest indication of any
mixture — of any hybrid forms.             In  the sixth place, there is the most
wonderful       adaptation      of special organs for the performance of
special   functions, and for the relation of these organs to particular
structures     in the vegetable kingdom. In the seventh place, there is
a  development, for which in extent and variety there is no parallel
in the world,      of structures designed for mere ornament,              and  entirely
separate from any other           known or conceivable         use.
    A few words on some of these characters               will show their separate
and    joint bearing on the idea of Creation by Law.
    In the first place, then, the absolute distinctiveness                    from   all
others of     this family of birds, coupled with its immense extent,
 gives the    idea of some common bond, some physical cause, to which
 such an    identity in physical characters must            be due.      This identity
 prevails   not only in such essential matters              as the structure     of the
 bill and tongue, in the form of the feet and of the wings, in the habits

278                  Proceedings        of the Royal        Society
of flight, in the nature of the food, but runs also into some very
curious details, as for example, in the number of feathers in the tail
and in the wings,        which     are constant      numbers     — adhered     to even
when some of the feathers, not being used even for ornament,                          are
reduced almost to rudiments.              But under degrees of           development
which    are very variable,      the number is invariable.            This identity     of
structure is the more remarkable              from the immense extent of the
group which      it characterises.        There    are now known        to science      no
less than   41 6  different species of humming-bird               ; and  it cannot      be
doubted that many more remain                to be discovered         among     the im
mense forests and mountain            ranges of Central America.
    Now, what       is the bond which unites              so closely,   in  a common
structure, all the forms of this great family of birds ?                We think it a
sufficient explanation       sometimes of the likeness of things, that they
are made     for a common purpose.           And    so  it is an explanation in       one
sense, but not in another.           It gives the reason why likeness should
be aimed at, but not the cause           through which it has been brought
about.     Sameness in the purpose for which things are intended, is
 a reason   why those things should            be made       alike; but it is    no ex
planation of the process to which the common aspect is due.                          It   is
 an explanation of the "why ;" but it is no explanation of the "how."
 Purpose is attained in nature through the instrumentality of means;
 and community         of aspect in created things suggests the idea of
some    common process in the creative work.                    The likeness which
 is due to common         parentage serves the most important purposes;
 but it is not the less the result of a physical cause, out of which it
 arises by way of natural consequence.                The likeness of the Hum
 ming-birds to     each    other suggests this kind of cause.                It   is true
 that the organs which          it principally affects        are   specially  adapted
 for a special habit of life.          They    are  titted to enable the bird            to
 feed on the nectar, and the insects              which     frequent   the nectar of
 flowers.     But there     are   flowers in abundance           in other quarters of
 the globe where there are no Humming-birds.                      And here    we come
 on the curious       facts of geographical        distribution, — a class of       facts
 which,    as much      as any other,      suggest some specific          methods       as
 having been followed           in the work of creation.             Humming-birds
 are absolutely      confined     to the great continent            of America      with
 its adjacent     islands.      Within those limits there is every                 range

of climate,           and    there        are        particular species of Humming-bird
adapted to every              region        where         a flowering       vegetation           can    sub
sist.      It    is therefore neither climate                    nor food which confines the
Humming-birds               to the   New World.                 What is       it,    then   ?    The idea
of "centres            of creation"         is   at once suggested               to    the mind.           It
seems as        if    the Humming-birds were introduced                              at one spot, and
as    if   they       had spread over the whole                     continent which was                    ac
cessible        to     that spot.
                      them    from They are absent elsewhere,
simply because from that spot the other continents of the world
were    inaccessible to them.                    But     if   these ideas are suggested to the
mind       by    the general         aspect of this family as                    a    whole,       they are
strengthened              by some of the facts which                     we      discover        when      we
examine          and compare         with each other the genera and species of
which      it   is   composed.          There         is
                                                      a       beautiful gradation between the
different        genera and the different                       species, so much             so,    that   it
has     been found impossible to divide the Humming-birds into
more     than two sub-families, from the absence of sufficiently well-
marked          divisions.      And yet, on the other hand, they cannot                                    be
arranged          in anything             like       a    continuous     series,        because some
links appear to be   missing in the chain.
     But these general facts terminate in nothing more definite than
a    vague surmise.           When we enter farther into details, we feel at
once    how      little they agree with any physical law which                              is   known or
even    conceivable           by    us.         If

whole      group reminds us of the likeness which   due to community        is
of blood,     equally true that the differences between the species
                it   is
are totally distinct both in kind and degree from the variation
which we ever see arising among the offspring of the same parents.
Let us look at               what    these           differences     are.        The generic            and
specific        distinctions between  humming-birds are mainly of
                                                      the
two kinds, — ltt, Differences in the form of essential organs, such

variation,       the only one on which the law of natural selection                                     has
any bearing at all,           is   the first.            And on that kind of variation, the
only     bearing          which natural selection                  has      is   this — that       if   any
Humming-bird              were born with              a   new form of bill, or         a    new form of

 improved   bill and wing would naturally tend to        be perpetuated by
ordinary generation. This is unquestionably true         ; but it really does
not touch the facts of the case.       The bills and wings of the different
genera do not differ from each other in respect of any comparative
advantage of this kind, but simply in respect to variety correspond
ing with the variety of certain vegetable forms.         One form of bill is
as good as another,      but some forms are adapted to some special
class of flower.    Some bills, for example, are formed of enormous
length, specially adapted to obtain access to the nectar chambers of
long tubular flowers, such as the Brugmansia. Some, on the other
hand,    as  if  to show    that the same end may           be  attained    by
different means, obtain access to the same flowers by a shorter pro
cess, and pierce the bases of the corolla instead of seeking access by
the mouth.      Some have bills bent downwards like a sickle, adapted
to searching the bark of palm-trees         for the insects hid under the
ecaly covering ; others have bills curved in the opposite direction,
fitted, apparently,   to the curious construction     of some of the     great
family of Orchids    so  immensely developed in the forests of Central
America.      Some have bills equally well adapted for searching a
vast   variety of flowers     and    blossoms,    and  these,   accordingly,
migrate    with the flowering season, and issuing from the great
stronghold of the family in tropical America, spread like our own
summer birds of passage, northwards         to Canada, and southwards to
Cape Horn, in the corresponding         seasons of the year.     In  contrast
with these species of extended range, there are many species whose
habitat is confined, perhaps, to a single mountain, and there are
some which never have been seen beyond the edges of some extinct
volcano, whose crater is now filled with a special flora.            Many of
the great mountains       of the Andes have each of them               species
peculiar  to themselves.     On Chimborazo       and Cotopaxi, and other
summits,    special forms    of Humming-birds        are found     in special
zones of vegetation     even close up to the limits of perpetual snow.
Again, many of the islands        have species peculiar to themselves.
The little island of Juan Fernandez, 300 miles from the main
land, has three species peculiar to itself, of which two are so distinct
from all others known,       that they cannot      for a moment       be con
founded with any of them.        It is impossible not to see, in such com
plicated facts as these, that the creation of new species has followed

some     plan   in which mere variety has              been in   itself an object and
an aim.     The divergence              of form is not       a divergence       which can
have arisen    by way of natural consequence, merely from compara
tive     advantage and disadvantage in the struggle for existence.
Bills highly specialised              in form       are certainly not those which
would     give the         greatest advantage         to birds       which have equal
access    to the abundant flora of an immense continent.                       Some form
of bill adapted           to the probing or piercing             of all flowers            with
almost     equal        ease,   would    be   the    form    most     favourable       to the
multiplication          and spread of Humming-birds.                 Continued approxi
mation to some common                   type would seem to be quite as natural,
and a much more advantageous                  kind of change     as regards advantage
in thestruggle for existence, than endless divergence and special
adaptation to limited spheres of enjoyment.     At all events, we
may safely say that              mere advantage, in         Mr Darwin's       sense,   is not
the rulewhich has chiefly guided creative power in the origin of
these^new species. It seems rather to have been a rule having for
its object the mere multiplying of life, and the fitting of new forms
for new spheres of enjoyment, according as these might arise out of
corresponding changes in other departments of the organic world.
  If,        turn to the other kind of specific distinction between
         now, we
Humming-birds, viz., that which consists in differences in the mere
colouring and dispositionof the plumage, we shall find the same
phenomena still more remarkable.    In the first place, it is to be
observed of the whole group that there is no connection which can
be traced       or conceived between the splendour of the Humming
birds and       any function essential to their life.                 If   there were any
such connection,           that splendour could not be confined, as it almost
exclusively       is,    to one sex.    The female birds are of course not
placed at   any disadvantage in the struggle for existence by their
more     sombre colouring. Mere utility in this sense, therefore, can
nave had     no share in determining one of the most remarkable of all
the    characteristics          of this family of birds.       Those who by special
study have       laid their mind alongside of the mind of Nature in any
one     of its departments,           have generally        imparted       to them     a   true
sense, so    far as      in the interpretation of her mysteries. Let
                         it   goes,

own opinion               is,   that this gorgeous colouring of the humming-birds
has been given for the mere purpose of ornament, and for no other
purpose of special adaptation in their mode of life                                 ;   in other    words,
that ornament and beauty, merely as such, was the end proposed."*
Different parts of the plumage                                 have been      selected in        different
genera as the principal subject                            of ornament.         In some,      it    is    the
feathers of the crown worked into different forms                                of crest in ;        some,
it   is   the feathers of the throat, forming gorgets and beards of many
shapes and hues;                       in some,      it   is   a    special   development        of      neck
plumes, elongated into frills and tippets of extraordinary form                                           and
beauty.       In     a    great number of genera the feathers of the tail are                             the
special subjects of decoration, and this on every variety                                  of plan        and
principle of ornament.                       In     some, the two central feathers are most
elongated, the others decreasing                           in length on either side,               so as    to
give the whole the wedge form.                                 In    others, the converse plan              is
pursued, the two lateral feathers being most developed, so that                                           the
whole       is   forked              after the manner           of the common swallow.                     In
others, again, they are radiated, or pointed and sharpened like thorns.
In   some        genera there               is   an extraordinary development                of     oue or
two feathers into plumes of enormous length, with flat or spatulose
terminations.               Mere ornament                 and variety of form, and these for
their own sake,                 is   the only principle or rule with reference to which
Creative Power seems to have worked in these wonderful                                       and      beau
tiful birds.          And            if   we cannot       account for the differences               in    the
general style and plan of ornament                                  followed in the whole group,
by referring them to any sort of use in the struggle                                    for existence,
still less   is      it   possible to account, on this principle, for the kind                             of
difference which separates from each other the different species                                           in
each of the genera.                        These     differences       are often    little more       than
a   mere difference                  of colour.
                                          The radiance of the ruby or topaz                                in
one species,         is   replaced perhaps                by
                                              the radiance of the emerald or the
sapphire in another.                       In all   other respects the different species                  are
sometimes            almost           exact counterparts             of each other.         As an         ex
ample, let me refer to the two species figured                                 by   Mr Gould       as the
Blue-tailed and the Green-tailed Sylphs                                ;   and also to two species

of the
           " Comets," in which two different kinds of luminous reds or
crimsons are nearly            all that serve to distinguish the species.
  A similar principle of variation applies in other genera, where
the amount of difference is greater. For example, one of the most
singular and beautiful of all the tribe    is comprised within the
genus
      "  Lophornis," or the
                             " Coquettes."    The principle of orna
ment in this genus     that the different species are all provided
                                  is,
both with    brilliant crests, and with frills or tippets on the neck.
The    feathers of these parts are generally of one colour, ending in
spots or spangles              of another; the spangles                 being generally of
metallic     lustre.          There      seems       to be   a   rule of inverse proportion
between the two          kinds of ornament.                   The species which have the
neck plumes longest have the shortest                          crests, and vice versa.          In
the shape     and structure of all essential organs there                         is   hardly any
difference       between          the species.        I      need not     multiply instances
farther, since many others                   of the   same    kind will      be observed in    Mr
Gould's splendid work.    Now, what explanation does the law of
natural selection         give — will
                             not say of the origin, but even of the
                                    I
continuance and preservation — of such specific varieties as these                               ?
None whatever.            A       crest of topaz       is   no better in the struggle fot
existence     than a crest of sapphire.          frill ending in spangles of
                                                          A
the emerald       is   no better in the battle of life than   frill ending in a
spangles     of the ruby.               It   is   impossible to bring such varieties into
relation with any physical law known to us.                             It   has relation, how
ever, to     a      which stands in close analogy with our own
                 purpose,
knowledge of purpose in the works of man. Mere beauty and mere
variety, for their own sake, are objects which we ourselves seek
when we can make the forces                        of nature subordinate          to the attain
ment    of them.          There seems to              be no conceivable           reason why we
should doubt or question, that these are ends and aims also in the
forms given       to living organisms,                  when the facts correspond with
this view, and with no other.                       In this   sense, we can trace         a   crea
tive   law, — that      is,   we can see that these forms of life do fulfil                a   pur
pose and     intention, which we can appreciate and understand.
  But then       it    may be asked, has this purpose and intention been
attained without the use of means? Have no physical laws been used,

its unity in variety ?             I   am not now seeking to answer this question
in the negative.   All             I say      is,   that the physical laws which                 are
made subservient         to this purpose are entirely unknown to us.                         That
particular combination                 of a great many natural laws, which Mr
Darwin groups under the name of Natural Selection, does not in                                   the
least answer the conditions which we seek in  law to account           a                          for
either the origin or the spread of such creatures as the various
kinds of Humming-birds. On the other hand,      am asked whether       if
                                                                       I
I   believe that every separate species has been                         a    separate creation
— not born, but separately made —                     I       must answer,         that

believe it.  think the facts do suggest to the mind the idea of

vince us that we know nothing of its nature,                            or of the conditions
under which        it   does       its glorious work.                 Our experience        of    the
existing order of nature               is,   that the young of each species                 repeat
the form and the colours                     of their parent, and that even                 where
variations       occur, they are inconstant,                  and tend to disappear.             We
have no knowledge,  for example, that from the eggs of the Blue-
tailed Sylph  pair of Green-tailed Sylphs can ever be produced.

tippet of emerald            spangles,        can ever hatch           out    a   pair of young
adorned with spangles of some other gem.                                 And yet we cannot
assert that such phenomena                     are impossible,         nor can     it   be denied
that,   as   a   matter of speculation,               this process       is    natural and       easy
of conception,         as compared            with the idea of each species being
separately called into existence,                    out of the inorganic elements of
which its body          is   composed.              Such   new births —       if   they do       take
place — would perfectly fulfil,              I  think, the only idea           we can ever form
of new creations.            For example,           it   would appear that every variety
which    is   to take its place as            a     new species must be born male and
female   ;    because   it    is   one of the facts of specific variation in the
Humming-birds, that although the male and female plumage                                           is
generally entirely different, yet the female of each species                                 is    as
distinct from the female of every other,                         as the male        is    from the
male of every other.               If therefore,         each new variety were not born
in couples, and        if    the divergence of form were not thus secured                          in
the organisation        of both the sexes,               it   would    fail   to be established,
or would exhibit for           a   time the phenomena of mixture, and termi

the emphatic       declaration of Mr Gould, that among the thousands
of specimens        which have passed through his hands, from all the
genera       of this great family, he has never seen one case of mixture
or hybridism between any two species, however nearly                                            allied.      But
this passage      is   so important,                 that    I   quote it entire.
                                                                                            "    It might be
thought by some persons                        that four hundred species of birds                  so    dimin
utive in      size, and of one family, could scarcely                               be      distinguished
from each other         ;but any one who studies the subject, will soon per
ceive that such        is not the case. Even the females, which assimi
late more       closely to each other than the males, can                                       be separated
with perfect     certainty         ;    nay, even a tail-feather                will   be sufficient         for
a   person well versed in the subject to say to what genus and species
the   bird from which it has been taken belongs.         mention this                  I
fact to show      that what we designate                         a species has      really distinctive
and constant characters                    ;    and in the whole of my experience, with
many thousands         of humming-birds passing through my hands,                                              I
have       never observed an instance of any variation which would lead
me to      suppose that          it was the result of                a    union of two species.                  I
write this     without bias, one way or the other, as to the question of
the origin     of species.             I
                              am desirous of representing Nature in her
wonderful ways as she presents herself to my attention                                          at the close
of my work, after a period of twelve years of incessant labour, and
not less than      twenty years of interesting study."*
     If,   therefore, new species are born from the old,                            it     is   not by acci
dental       mixture   ;    it   is    not by the mere nursing of changes advan
tageous      in the battle of life               ;   it   must be from the birth of some one
couple, male and female, whose organisation                                    is   subjected to new
conditions      corresponding                  with each other, and having such force of
self-continuance, as to secure                       it    against    reversion.           It   matters not
how small        the difference                  may be from the parent                    form    ;   if   that
difference be constant, and                      if   it   be associated       with some difference
equally      constant        in the female                  form,    it   becomes at once               a   new
species.       There are some                   cases mentioned           by   Mr Gould which may
possibly be examples                  of the first founding of                  a   new species.              In
the beautiful genus              " Cynanthus," he tells us that there                              are      some

 local varieties          near Bogota,         in which the ornament                           is partially
 changing from blue to green                      ;    and        it is   a curious fact, that this
 variation appears to be taking effect under the direction                                           of   some
definite rule or " law," — inasmuch                          as    it is only the eight                central
feathersof the tail which are tipped with the new colour. Mr
Gould expressly says of one such variety from Ecuador, that it
possesses         characters     so    distinctive          as to     entitle      it,   in his      opinion,
to the rank of          a   separate species.               The very discussion                   of such     a
question         shows      the possibility of new births being the means                                     of
introducing new species.  But my object here      simply to point                  is
out that Mr Darwin's theory offers no explanation of such births,
either as respects their origin or their preservation, neither does                                           it
even approach to tracing these births to any physical law whatever.
Itfails also to recognise, even     does not exclude, the relation
                                               if       it
which the birth of new species has to the mental purpose of pro
ducing mere beauty and mere variety.                                      Nevertheless          it   may be
true that ordinary generation                  has been the instrument employed                               ;
but   if   so,   it   must be employed under extraordinary conditions,                                     and
directed to extraordinary results.
     The only          senses,  in which we get any glimpse
                                 therefore,                                                                   of
creation by law are these — Is*, That the close physical connec
tion between different specific forms                        is   probably      due to the opera
tion of some force or forces common to them all                                ;    2d,    That           these
forces have been employed and worked with others                                               equally un
known, for the attainment                 of such ends                as the       multiplication            of
life, in forms fitted for new spheres of employment,                                       and for the
display of new kinds of beauty.
   Is there anything in this conclusion to conflict with such                                          know
ledge as we have from other sources of the nature and working
of creative power?               I    do not know on what authority                             it   is    that
we so often           speak as   if   creation were not creation, unless                          it   works
from nothing as its material,                 and        by   nothing         as    its means.             We
know that out of the "dust of the ground," that       out of                             is,               the
ordinary elements of nature, are our own bodies formed, and                                                the
bodies of all living things.                  Nor       is   there anything which should
shock      us in the idea that the                    creation       of new forms, any                    more
than their propagation,               has been          brought           about by the use and
instrumentality of means.                In   a   theological             point of view         it   matters

nothing what those means have been.                    I   agree with Mons. Guizot
when he       says that
                        " Those only would                 be serious       adversaries    of
the doctrine         of Creation who could affirm that the                  universe — the
earth and man           upon it — have been          from all eternity, and in all
respects    just what they are now."*                 But this cannot         be affirmed
except in the teeth          of facts which Science has clearly ascertained.
There has been a            continual coming-to-be of new forms of life.f
This is Creation,         no matter           what have been      the    laws or forces
employed        by    Creative      Power.        The truth      is,   that the theory
which      fixes upon inheritance as the cause of organic                         likeness,
startles us     only when      it   is   applied to forms in which unlikeness              is
more prominent                         The idea, for example, that
                         than resemblance.
the   different kinds of Pigeon, or of Humming-birds, have all de
scended     through successive variation from some one ancestral pair,
whether    it  be true or not, would not startle any one. Yet,    this              if
be true,     we must be prepared                 for the same surmise extending
farther.      The advocates of development urge that time                      is
                                                                               a     power
ful factor.       They say that          if   small changes, but constant enough,
and definite enough            to constitute new species, can and do arise out
of born varieties,        it   is   impossible     to fix the limits of divergence
which may be reached             in the course of ages.        Yet     it   surely does not
follow that there        is   no such     limit because we cannot fix it. It             does
not necessarily        follow that because we admit the idea of the Rock-
dove, and     the Turtle-dove, and the Ring-dove being all descended
from one        ancestral      Pigeon, we are bound            to accept the idea of
the Whale, and the Antelope, and the Monkey being all descended
from some one primeval mammal.     Mr Darwin says, truly enough,
that inheritance " that cause which alone, as far as we positively
                          is
know, produces          organisms        quite like, or nearly like, each other."
But this     is   no reason why we should             conclude     that inheritance        is
the only cause which can produce organisms quite unlike, or only
very partially like, each other. We are surely not entitled to
assume that          all degrees and kinds of likeness can only arise from
this single cause.            Yet until this extreme proposition                be proved,

or rendered probable, we have a sound scientific basis for doubting
the application    of the theory precisely in proportion to the unlike-
ness    of the animals to which it is applied.  And this is the ground
of reasoning, besides the ground of feeling, on which we                                         revolt
from the doctrine             as applied to        Man.          We      do so becanse we are
conscious of an amount                 and of a kind of difference                  between our

able, in spite of the close affinities                    of bodily structure.               Bnt     the

this common structure             ?     The fact which                has always appeared to
me most   difficult to disengage from the theory of development,                                         is
the existence of rudimentary or aborted organs     the existence of          ;

cut the gum — and which are entirely useless to the animal.                                          We
have an inherent conviction that this must have some use in the
future, or     it    must have had       it   in the past.             Whether we look              at   it
in the light of history, or prefer to regard                     it   in the light of prophecy,
it   points    to the existence         of some derivative form in -which                          these
teeth have been, or are to be, turned                       to use.          There    is    one sug
gestion on this subject which               I     cannot         accept.         When men           were
yet unwilling to admit the existence                        of life and death upon                    the
globe so long before the creation                        of man,      it   used to be said that
fossils were only " sports of nature." So in our own day,       have                       I
heard    said that rudimentary organs are merely intended to satisfy
        it
that condition of our finite minds, in virtue of which we are nnable
to conceive          creation,    except in connection with some history and
method of growth.                And    so, as   a   condescension              to this weakness,
aborted       members are given             to suggest       a    history which was never
true, and      a   method which was never followed!                          Now, of one thing
I    feel     as sure    as
                          I       can be      of any truth, viz., that there                          are
no fictions          in nature,       and no jokes.              Whatever natural                things
really point to, they                 point to faithfully;                 and the conclusions
really indicated          are never false.               Abortive          organs    mean        some
thing, and they mean               it    truly.      Still, there          is   no proof that         in
heritance       is   the only cause from which such structures                             can     arise.
In the inorganic world                 we    know        that    not mere similarity, but

 absolute     identity of form,        as  in crystals, is the result of laws
 which have nothing to do with inheritance,                  but of forces whose
 nature    it is to aggregate the particles of matter in identic shapes.
 It  is impossible    to say how far a similar unity of effect may have
 been    impressed on       the forces through which vital          organisms are
first started on     their way.      There are some essential resemblances
between      all forms of life which it is impossible even in imagina
tion    to connect with community of blood by descent.                     For ex
ample,      the bilateral arrangement           is common      to all   organisms,
down      at least to the      Radiata.      Again,     the  general    mechanism
of the       digestive   organs    by     which food is in part assimilated
and     part rejected,    is also common through a range of equal ex
tent.     These    are fundamental similarities of plan, depending pro
bably on the very nature          of forces of which we know nothing, but
which we have not the slightest reason to suppose are due to in
heritance.       Other similarities of plan          may depend      on  the same
laws,     equally   unconnected      with inheritance by descent.          Indeed,
inheritance has been suggested as the cause, mainly because there
is a    difficulty in conceiving any other.             But there is at least an
equal difficulty in conceiving the applicability of this cause to Man.
Mons. Guizot, in the work already quoted,* lays it down as a
physical impossibility that Man — the human                 pair — can have been
introduced into the world except in complete stature — in the full
possession of all his faculties and powers.                He holds it as certain
that on no other       condition could Man, on his first appearance, have
been    able to survive and to found          the human family.        Even those
who distrust      this argument as entitled to the rank of a self-evident
physical truth, must admit             that it is at least quite   as good as the
opposite assertion,      that any origin except the origin of natural birth
 is inconceivable.      Where our ignorance is         so profound   no reasoning
of this   kind is of much value      ;  but there is much to be said in support
of Mons.      Guizot's position.     Certainly, Man as a mere animal is the
most     helpless of all animals.         His whole frame has relation to his
mind,     and apart from that relation,           it is feebler than the frame
of any of the brutes.           Yet in its plan and structure it is homo-
 logically, that is ideally, the same as theirs— organ answering

to organ,        and bone to bone.             "Adherence to Type"                are    words
expressive  of an idea, of a purpose, which we see fulfilled in
organic forms.  But this purpose must have sought its own accom
plishment by the     of means, and the question of science always
                         use
is,
  what were these     Love of beauty
                           ?            equally    purpose which
                                                      is             a
we see fulfilled in nature, but in the case of the Humming
birds  this has been accomplished by giving to their plumes the
structure of " thin plates," which decomposes light and flings
back its prismatic colours to the eye.                     Fitness and special adap
tation    is   another of the purposes of creation, but this also                is   attained
through the careful arrangement, and pliability to Use, of physical
laws.    In like manner, " Adherence to Type"       the expression   is
of    fact, or the statement of
      a                         purpose, which, like all the other
                                          a
purposes fulfilled        in nature, invites to an investigation of the in
strumentality employed.     We see the purpose but we do not see
the method.    We see the purpose, for example, in the wonderful
adaptability of the vertebrate type to the infinite varieties of life to
which     it    serves as an       organ and    a   home.        There    is   at least one
conclusion       which   I    hold to be certain, namely, this— that no theory
in respect to the means and method employed in the work of crea
tion, can have the slightest effect in removing that work from the
relation in which        it   stands to the attributes of creative              Will.
  We cannot too completely shake off the notion that things which
happen by way of
                 " natural consequence" are thereby removed from
being the effect of purpose and the work of                Will.     We forget that all
our own works are works done through the use and instrumentality
of natural forces, and        itis   knowledge and intelligence alone which en
able usto combine these forces for the accomplishment                      of ourdesigns.
All   that we do, or can effect,        brought about by way of natural
                                          is
consequence.           The steam-engine works by way of natural conse
quence    ;         Mr Babbage's calculating machine, — so does the
               so does
electric telegraph, — so does the solar system. Everything that                             is
done in nature, as well as everything that                  is   done in art, seems         to
be done— as       it   were — by knowing how to do it.               Whatever may           be
the ultimate seat of the elementary forces of nature, they can only
produce the effects which we desire to attain by being combined
under the control of mind.                They appear to          be used      in the works
of nature precisely on the             same    principle    on   which they        are   used

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1864-65.                              '291
 by man.          The fewer those elementary forces, the greater must be
 the   mental power, and skill, and knowledge, under which they are
yoked       to such various use.            And it is apparently out of           a  small
number of elementary forces, having fixed rules too, limiting their
combination, that all the infinite varieties of organic and inorganic
matter       are built up by means of nice adjustment.                        As all the
faculties of a powerful               mind can utter their voice in language
whose       elements        are   reducible to twenty-four letters, so all the
forms      of nature, with all the ideas they express,                  are  worked     out
from a few simple forces,              having   a few simple properties.
   And here          I  cannot     help saying that      I  do not share in the im
pression        which is felt by many, that the progress of modern in
vestigation is in a direction tending to materialism.                         Of course I
am not        speaking of what may              be   the tone of individual minds.
But    I do speak,         and with strong conviction, of the general bearing
of scientific         truth.     I  not only do not share in that             impression,
but 1 entertain            an exactly opposite belief.           Nothing is more         re
markable          in   the    present    state of physical research            than   what
may be called             the transcendental       character     of its results.      And
what      is transcendentalism           but the tendency to trace up all things
to the relation           in which they stand to abstract ideas ? And what
is  this but to bring all physical phenomena nearer and nearer into
relation with            the   phenomena      of mind      ?    Is   this   materialism ?
Some      of the ablest writers who have incurred                 reasonable suspicion
as to    the drift of their teaching,          nevertheless give witness most em
phatically to what            I  would call the purely mental             quality of the
ultimate results            of physical inquiry.         Mr Lewes, whose work on
Aristotle       I  have already quoted, says,           "  The fundamental ideas of
modern         science      are as transcendental         as any     of the axioms in
ancient philosophy."*               And this is true.       Let  us look   for a moment
on the       light, small as it may be, which physiology has cast on the
great     mystery of Life.           We never see Life separate from some ma
terial organisation.            Yet what is the doctrine proclaimed, I believe,
first,   by the great John Hunter, and now emphatically repeated by
men     like Professor Huxley and Dr Carpenter ? It is that organisa
tion is not the cause            of Life, but Life is the cause of organisation.

Material organs are merely the special forms built up and fashioned
by the vital forces, whatever these may be, for the discharge of
special functions. And it is well worthy of remark, that some of
the most clear and striking             illustrations of this truth       are to be
found in some of the lowest forms of life, revealed to us only by
the microscope.         Professor    Huxley and Dr Carpenter both refer             to
the Foraminifera, in which the most beautiful and complicated
forms of shell are evolved by the vital force working in creatures
composed of simple jelly, without parts, without structure, without
organs of any kind.          Thus the deeper we go in science, the              more
certain it becomes that all the realities of nature are in the region
of the Invisible     ; so  that the saying is literally true, that the things
which    are seen are    temporal, and that it is only the things which are
not seen that are eternal.          Surely    if this is materialism,     it is   ma
terialism    spiritualised.     These doctrines seem to me rather to bring
into the strict domain of science, ideas which, in the earlier stages
of humau knowledge,           lay wholly within the region of faith or of
belief.     For example, the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews
                                                                               '' that
specially declares that it is by faith that we understand
the things which are seen              were not made of things which                do
appear."*        Yet this is now one of the most assured doctrines                  of
science, that invisible forces are behind and above all visible phe
nomena, moulding them in forms of infinite variety, of all which
forms the only real knowledge we possess                lies in our perception of
their beauty and their fitness — in short of their being all the work
of " Toil co- operant to an end." Creation by Law means nothing
but Creative Force directed by Creative Knowledge, worked under the
control of Creative        Power, and in fulfilment of Creative Purpose.

   Baron Giovanni       Plana was born about 1790.      After studying at
the  Polytechnic School, he was made Professor of Mathematics in the
Military School of Alexandria, and then Professor of Mathematics
in the   University of Turin.       In 1820 the  King of Sardinia directed
him to erect the observatory at      Turin, of which he was made Director
in 1822.      He became Director of the Military School, Member of
the    Academy of Sciences at Turin, of which he was afterwards
president,    Chevalier of the Iron Crown, and of the Civil Order of
Savoy, and member         of various foreign academies. He was elected
a Corresponding       Member of the French Institute, and in 1860 one
of the eight foreign Associates of that body.         In 1820 he received
from the     Academy of Sciences in Paris the great mathematical
                 "
prize for his       Theory of the Lunar Motions."       He was elected an
Honorary Fellow of this Society on 19th January 1835.
   He married the niece of the celebrated Lagrange. He died at
Turin on 20th       January 1864.
   He is the author of many celebrated memoirs in the Transactions
of the   Turin Academy.        The most important of them relate to the
Constitution of the Atmosphere          and Astronomical Refraction, the
Theory of Distribution         of Electricity, the Theory of the Moon's
Motion, and the Perturbations of the Satellites of Jupiter and Saturn.

   Leonard Horner was born in Edinburgh on the 17th January
1785.    He was the third and youngest son of John Horner, a
merchant and linen -manufacturer,           who long resided in George
Square,   Edinburgh, and was         a  citizen of marked         ability,    pos
sessing   much    information, and full of anecdotes of old                times.
Leonard's    mother    was  Joanna     Baillie  of the family of Baillies
of Dochfour, Inverness-shire.           He    was   sent    to  school at       the
age   of seven, and when he        was   nine   years old he entered the
High School.       His brother Francis       was also a     pupil of the     same
school,  which at that time was presided over by its celebrated
rector Dr Adam.       He was a lively, but rather careless boy, and did
not display the diligence or perseverance              of his brother.         His
amiable   manners, however, made him a great favourite with all.
He displayed at first    a fancy for a sea-faring     life, but the idea       was
afterwards   abandoned.      On leaving the High           School    he entered
the University of Edinburgh.         He attended the lectures on         mathe
matics   by Playfair,    and   those on moral       philosophy by Dugald
Stewart,   and in 1802 he became a pupil in the chemistry class
taught by Dr Hope.         At this time mineralogy occupied a share of
his attention, and he began to form a collection of minerals. This
early taste was developed in his after life.
   About the    age  of nineteen he went to London with his               father,
and there    the family resided       for many     years.      At the    age     of
twenty-one    he married Miss Lloyd, daughter of          a  landed proprietor
in Yorkshire.     He now entered with devotion             into the study        of
science,  and    was   received   into eminent      literary and scientific
society in London.        The intercourse      which    existed    between his
grandfather's   family and Dr Hutton seems to have operated on the
mind of young Horner in inspiring him with a taste for geology. He
entered the Geological Society in 1808, the year after its formation.
He was one of its earliest secretaries, and he continued to the last
to take a warm and active interest in its proceedings.                  Circum
stances connected     with the linen-trade obliged him to return                 to
Edinburgh in 1815 in order to attend to business.                   In 1816     he
became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.                     He    con
tributed  a paper on the occurrence         of Megalichthys      Ilibberti   in   a
bed   of cannel coal in Fifeshire. Soon after this the premature
death of his brother Francis, who was rising into eminence as a

                     of Edinburgh,     Session 1864-65.                  295
statesman,     cast a gloom over his spirit.       His brother died in the
year 1817, at     Pisa, where he had gone for the sake of his health.
Leonard Horner left his family, and accompanied his brother to
Pisa, and was with him at his death.          A  monument     was erected to
Francis Horner in Westminster Abbey.
   Edinburgh at this time        possessed  many eminent      Whig lawyers,
who    distinguished themselves in politics and literature.          Horner
warmly joined them from congeniality of opinions and sentiments,
and by his active and methodical habits he became the chief organiser
of their political meetings.        In 1825 he acted as chairman at the
dinner given to      J oseph Hume.     He had a deep sympathy for those
who    had been exiled from their country on account of liberal opi
nions.     Several of the   Italian emigrants, Ugoni, Demarchi, Arriva-
bene,   Castiglione, and others, shared his hospitality. To this is
perhaps due that love for Italy which the family of Leonard Horner
have always maintained.          One of his daughters has translated      the
history of Colletta, has written a short history of Naples, and        a few
days before her father's death published        a book on the poet   Giusti,
all which are works of much value.
   He also espoused with earnestness           the cause of the working
men, whose education        he considered as having been neglected         on
all hands.      In  1821 he founded     the School   of Arts in Edinburgh,
for the   instruction of mechanics, and he never ceased to contribute
to  its welfare.     This school has gone on prosperously.     The average
attendance      for the last four years has been 700 annually. No
similar institution in the empire has been so successful.          This suc
cess is  owing to the soundness of its constitution, which was entirely
the   work of Mr Horner.       The students have no connection with its
management.         The Directors have the sole superintendence,         and
they are    elected by the subscribers out of their own body, and         are
always men       of good position and of education.       Females are not
allowed    to attend.     There are a given number of subjects, each
taught    by able and permanent lecturers.          No casual or itinerant
lecturers are employed.        Mr Horner acted    as honorary  secretary  till
he went to    London in 1828.      He founded   a permanent   prize of three
guineas, to be awarded by competitive        examination in the classes of
mathematics, natural philosophy, and chemistry,          in succession.

296                 Proceedings    of the Royal    Society
iu Edinburgh, he, along with Lord Cockburn, set about the esta
blishment of the Edinburgh Academy, which has continued to
flourish since its foundation.      Mr Horner visited the Academy           on
many occasions even after he left Edinburgh, and the last time              he
did   so was in     July   1863.   On the same     occasion he visited     the
High School, in which he had        been a  pupil, and he was present at
the distribution of prizes, and gave an excellent address.
    In 1827 he became Warden of the London University. This
office he resigned       after four years, and retired     to Bonn,    where
he remained      for six years with his family.      In 1833 he     accepted
the office   of Inspector of Factories, and did his duty most           faith
fully and philanthropically.        By his labours great     improvements
took place in the mills and mines, more especially in regard           to the
employment      of women and children.         He earned the    respect and
the goodwill of the operatives, and this is evinced by the memorial
presented to the Misses        Horner after his death by the operative
cotton-spinners     of Lancashire, in which they express their feelings
of heartfelt sorrow and regret,     as well as  of profound sympathy,       on
the death of    Mr Horner, their father.        They speak with grateful
recollections of his unremitting labours in the cause of justice and
humanity, his impartiality in the administration of the laws made
for the protection of their wives and children, and his firmness in
their vindication.
    He   was  assiduous     in his attendance    at the   Royal   and    Geo
logical Societies      of London.     He entered     the  former   on     11th
November      1813, and he was subsequently        one of the Vice-Presi
dents of the Society; of the latter he was twice chosen President.
 His efforts were directed to the better organising of these Societies,
 and he was successful in adding materially to the efficiency of the
 Royal Society     as regards the election  of members and the       conduct
 of business.     In  1861 he delivered  his last address   as President of
the Geological       Society.   He had likewise published      a memoir of
 his brother    Francis, in two large volumes, and had translated             a
 work by Cousin on education in Germany.
    In 1851 Mr Horner suggested a series of investigations as                to
the deposits of the Nile.        These were    conducted by an Armenian
 officer of engineers, Hekekyan Bey.         These    researches  seemed     to
 support the view then propounded as to the great antiquity of            man

and his works.         The results were given to the Royal Society in
1855.    The experiments thus instituted in the hope of obtaining an
accurate chronometric        scale for testing the age of a given thickness
of Nile sediment, are not considered by experienced Egyptologists
to be   satisfactory.
   After acting for thirty years as Inspector of Factories,                he re
signed his office, and devoted         his attention    principally to geology,
classifying and arranging with great patience, perseverance, and
skill, the foreign      collection of the Geological       Society in Somerset
House.      In 1861     he visited  Italy, and resided for eight months at
Florence.       There he met with a sad bereavement in the death of
Mrs Horner,        his companion for fifty-six years.          She was a most
attractive lady, with a highly cultivated mind.               From the shock
of this event       Horner never recovered completely, and it threw a
shade    over his declining years. When at Florence he translated
with happy                           "
                fidelity Villari's Life of Savonarola,"         which he after
wards published        with notes.     He continued      to work to     the end,
and he died on 5th          March 1864, at     60 Montagu Square, London,
at the age     of seventy-nine.
    A correspondent in America says of Horner — " Among us in
the United States not a few knew and valued him as the biographer
of his brother, Francis Horner, a statesman whose early death is
still to  be  counted among the misfortunes of his country, and whose
life, republished      here in 1853, has served to        join and strengthen
the principle      of many an aspiring young jurist in the United States,
as  it has  in England, from its first appearance there. Others on
our side    of the Atlantic have known Mr Horner                as a   naturalist,
 who was at one time        President of the Geological Society, and who
                                                     '
contributed      many valuable papers to its Transactions.'               Others
again have      known him personally as the father of Lady Lyell, to
whom and her          eminent    husband so many Americans became at
tached    during their visit to the United States, and who were always
proud    to present to their distinguished father the friends from
abroad who       visited them in London."         It  has been   well remarked,
 that  Mr Horner was one of the living links which bound the pre
 sent  race of geologists to the fathers and founders of British geo
 logy.    His recollections went back       to the latter part   of last century,
 and he used      to tell anecdotes of the days of Hutton, and Playfair,

298                 Proceedings         of the Royal     Society
and   Hall — names to which we now-a-days look through such along
vista of years, crowded with discovery, that they seem to stand far
away amid the halo of an early heroic life.
   James    Miller       was born at the Manse of Eassie in Forfarshire,                   on
the 22d of    April 1812.        He was the third son of the Rev. James
Miller, minister of the parish, and his wife Elizabeth Martin,
daughter of the Rev. Dr Martin, minister of Kirkcaldy, in Fife.
  At Eassie Mr Miller received his early training, and till he went
to College       at St Andrews he was constantly under the parental
eye; for his father,         aided by teachers and tutors, conducted the
education of his own family, along with the sons of several neigh
bouring proprietors.           Surrounded       by home influences,               Mr Miller
received the early training which fitted him, when a lad of only
twelve, for the Literary and Arts classes of the University of St
Andrews.         Here it was he first began to show his great intellectual
facility, taking bursaries, and distinguishing                   himself, more           par
ticularly   as a scholar in classics          and metaphysics,          in competition
with lads considerably older than himself.
  After three years spent at St Andrews, he repaired to Edinburgh
in 1827, and commenced his medical studies, not only under the
distinguished professors of medicine who then adorned our Uni
versity,    but also under        the late     Mr Liston, who,              as    a   private
lecturer unconnected with the University, had                  at that time taken the
whole country by surprise as a teacher and practitioner of surgery.
   In 1828 Mr Miller became              a   pupil of Liston      's,   and under that
tutelage there grew up between the master and student an affection
and mutual       regard, which, though interrupted,              so   far   as daily per
sonal intercourse was concerned, by Liston's                   removal           to London,
and finally eclipsed by the premature death of that illustrious man,
remained     throughout life       as    one of the tenderest               and warmest
emotions of Mr Miller's inmost feelings. It was about this time
that Mr Miller's anatomical skill led to his selection by Professor
Munro tertius       as   his demonstrator        of anatomy; and in the                  dis
charge of the duties of that responsible office, he acquired both that
familiarity with normal texture and diseased structure, as well as
that facility of description and easy diction, which were eminently
characteristic    of him throughout          his alter life.

                      of Edinburgh,     Session 1864-65.                    299
   It   was  during this period that his first essays in writing for the
press   commenced, Dr Munro having largely made use of his ready
pen in    preparing for publication his famous work upon the Gullet.
   In 1832, having taken his diploma as surgeon, he commenced
practice as    Listen's resident assistant    ;  and during the two succeed
ing years immediately preceding            Liston's removal to London, Mr
Miller not only acted in his absence, but largely relieved him in
the daily press of business, while his evenings were occupied in
re-writiug      and preparing     Mr Liston's Practical Surgery for pub
lication.
   When Liston went to London,            Mr Miller commenced practice on
his own account, and during the succeeding eight years continued
to make a         growing reputation,     and to acquire     a large  circle of
attached      friends — a reputation not only as a practitioner and
teacher    of surgery in the extra-academical school, but as a grace
ful public speaker, and as an attractive         lecturer to art students upon
pictorial anatomy.
   In 1840 he became          a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons,
and was     shortly afterwards elected surgeon to the Royal Infirmary.
In 1842, when the Chair of Surgery in the University of Edin
burgh became vacant, by the death            of Sir Charles Bell, Mr Miller
was    unanimously elected to the Professorship by the Town Council,
who then       exercised the patronage over all, except the Crown ap
pointments.         At this period he was only thirty years of age. From
that    time to this, for twenty-two sessions, Mr Miller uninter
ruptedly lectured to overflowing         classes of attentive and admiring
students.
    It  was   during the first year of his University course that a duo
decimo edition of his Principles and Practice of Surgery was pub
lished by the Messrs Black — a work which, passing through four
editions in octavo, acquired a world-wide reputation,             and of which
 the fifth edition,      under the  title of " A    System of Surgery," had
 only been      completed     a few   months    before his last fatal    illness
 manifested      itself.
    It  was   in 1842, shortly after becoming Professor of Systematic
 Surgery,    that Mr Miller was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society
 of Edinburgh.
    His printed works and papers amount to upwards of thirty, and

 300                Proceedings     of the Royal    Society
 are by no means confined to       purely professional    matters, bis warm
 interest   and zeal in social and religious questions       leading him     to
 spend much time in giving his support to whatever views his con
 victions espoused.      The  same conscientious    love for the success of
 truth stole away many an hour from the but limited leisure which
 his professional avocations afforded him, and induced him to ap
pear in public and advocate from the platform, to eagerly attentive
 audiences, the     same   views to which his      pen lent    so ready and
powerful a support.
    On the 17th of June, after an illness of only three weeks' duration,
 which at first created no serious anxiety in the minds of his medical
attendants, James      Miller  passed away from amongst us,       in the fifty-
second year of his age, and the twenty-second          of his Professorship.
    Robert Morrieson       was born in   Edinburgh    on the   18th January
1787, and was educated at the High School            and University there.
He studied medicine, and obtained         a surgeon's diploma    at the early
age   of nineteen.     His intentions were to proceed to India at         once
in   a medical    capacity, but he was prevented from doing so by             a
regulation    of the Court of Directors requiring medical officers       to be
of the    age of twenty-two.      Mr Morrieson, however, received from
his uncle, Sir Hugh Inglis, a direct civil appointment, and he pro
ceeded to India in 1806 as a civil servant, although very reluctant
to give up the profession he had early chosen, with the benevolent
purpose of doing good to his fellow-creatures.          He found, however,
afterwards    many opportunities     of gratifying this desire, and        em
ployed his medical skill among the poor natives of India.                   He
remained a considerable time at Beerbhoom under his own brother,
and rose to be Judge and Magistrate there.           Afterwards he    became
one   of the Judges of the Circuit Court at Moorshedabad, in which
office he continued till, owing to the state of his health, he re
turned to Scotland in 1829      ; and  till his death on the 10th Novem
ber 1864, he has chiefly resided at his house No. 6 Heriot Row,
Edinburgh,      and   at Harvieston in Mid-Lothian.           He became       a
Fellow of the Royal Society in 1822.
   Mr Morrieson was certainly one of those who, while they exercise
no small influence among the men and movements of their day,
are,  by reason of their retiring modesty, comparatively            unknown

                   of Edinburgh,    Session 1864-65.                   301
  to almost all beyond the circle of admiring and attached friends
 whom    they invariably attract    to themselves.     That he had not
 merely a large    heart, inclining  him to consider, sympathise     with,
 and assist whatever    justly claimed his sympathy, but also      a ready
 and liberal,  though discriminating hand, is attested not only by his
cordial  support of the institutions and schemes of the Church with
 which he was connected, but by the      spirit and manner in which he
aided other    enterprises of benevolence     and usefulness.    From his
extensive    connection   with the management      of trusts, which   as a
friend he had undertaken,      he was brought largely into contact with
young people.       To their instruction and enjoyment few could give
themselves     with greater geniality and success. He took a lively
and active    interest in the great questions and movements of his
times,  especially those involving or in any way affecting the prin
ciples  of Divine Revelation or the cause of Protestantism.              It
might well have been supposed that when nearly sixty years of age,
Mr Morrieson's days of active study were over; yet twenty years
ago he   was among the most regular       attenders upon the prelections
of Drs     Chalmers and Cunningham          in the New College.        His
power and     habits of regular study, early formed and matured by
long practice, continued with him to the last.         He devoted a fair
portion of time to the consideration of scientific subjects, on which
he possessed a large      and varied fund of information, and to his
torical and general literature.     His latter end was   peace.   He rests
from his labours,    and his works do follow him.
    Patrick Small Kbir Newbigging was born at Edinburgh on
2d November 1813.         He was the fifth son of Sir William New
bigging, who for many years practised medicine in Edinburgh with
great success.     Three of his brothers, William, Robert, and George,
studied medicine; but all of them, as well as John, who was a
writer to the Signet, died at comparatively      early ages.    Dr Patrick
Newbigging prosecuted his studies at Edinburgh, and graduated
there in 1834 ; bis thesis being on the Causes of the Impulse and
Sounds of the Heart.        He became a Fellow of the Royal College
of Surgeons in the same year.          During his student life he was
elected a President of the Royal Medical Society.          Before settling
 in practice he spent some time abroad in acquiring additional pro

302                  Proceedings       of the Royal      Society
fessional      knowledge     at foreign   schools.   On his return he     became
associated with his father in practice, and he joined the New Town
Dispensary       as one   of its medical officers. The subject of Ausculta
tion occupied a         considerable share of his attention, and in 1842 he
published a translation of Barth and Roger's Practical Treatise                  on
that subject.        He communicated         a paper to the Royal Society of
Edinburgh on certain circumstances              affecting    the colour of blood
during coagulation.
   Dr Newbigging filled many important situations in Edinburgh,
such as Surgeon to John Watson's Institution, and to Cauvin's Hos
pital ; Medical Referee of the Life Association Insurance Company
of Scotland   Physician to the Sick Children's Hospital, an institu
                ;
tion in the foundation of which he took a lively interest ; Examiner
in the College of Surgeons, and President of that body, 1861-63, as
well as President of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts. He became
a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1848. For several years he suffered
from valvular disease of the heart and aneurism of the aorta.                  The
symptoms were long very obscure, and the existence of the disease
was only known to a very few intimate friends.                 In spite of it    he
continued to perform          efficiently his responsible     duties to the last.
Long before his death he found that any exertion, especially                      in
walking up a rising ground, caused breathlessness and exhaustion.
He did not make this known, and rather endeavoured to conceal                     it;
so that few who saw his            cheerful and active demeanour could hare
suspected that he was labouring under                a   fatal disease which    was
gradually undermining his constitution.                  The autumn before       his
death he resided for some time at Callander,                where, by quiet and
relaxation, he hoped to recruit his strength.             On his return to Edin
burgh,          in October, the symptoms became aggravated,
             however,
although he was able to visit his patients till within three days                 of
his death, which took place on the morning of Saturday 10th
January 1864.           Those who knew him        intimately perceived    a    soft
ening influence coming over him, and an occasional solemnity                      of
expression which betokened Christian preparation for life beyond   a
the present.        He was   a   sound, judicious, and successful practitioner,
and was much beloved by his patients.                He exhibited on all    occa
sions    a   courteous, cheerful,     and gentlemanly demeanour,         and his
amiability gained him many friends.

                       of Edinburgh,       Session 1864-65.                   303
    Jims Pillans,           M.A,    LL.D., Professor     of Humanity in the
 University of Edinburgh, was born at Edinburgh in 1779, and
died on 27th March 1864, at the advanced age of eighty-five.
 His father was a printer in Edinburgh, and he was educated there.
He attended the          High School when Dr Adam was Kector, and at
the annual       examination in 1792 he ranked next           to Francis Horner,
who    then carried off the highest            honours.    After  a distinguished
career    in Edinburgh University, he became tutor in the family of
Mr Kennedy of Dunure, and afterwards in a family in Northumber
land,   finally settling in Eton       as a private tutor.    On the death of  Dr
Adam, in 1809,          Pillans became a candidate for the office of Rector
in the High School, and he was ably supported by Francis Horner
and other      influential friends who knew his merits           as a scholar and
a  teacher.      On the 24th January 1810, he was unanimously elected
to the office     by the Town Council.          His long residence in England,
and his     intimate acquaintance with the course of study pursued in
the   great schools in that country, rendered his appointment of no
small importance to          his native city. He continued to discharge the
duties     of the office for upwards of ten years in so able a manner as
to attract the attention         of educationists   both at home and abroad.
 During his tenure of office, the numbers in the class were doubled.
 The death of Professor Christison, in           June 1820, having occasioned
 a vacancy in the Humanity Chair of the University, Mr Pillans was
 unanimously elected by the patrons as his successor.                For a period
 of more than forty years he discharged               the duties of this office.
 His advancing years called for relaxation, and             he resigned his pro
 fessorship in 1863.
    During      the whole of his long life,        Mr Pillans devoted himself
 with   all the energy         and fervour     of his nature — and these were
 great — to the elevation        of the elementary and higher education of
this country.         By speech, writing, and example he endeavoured
unceasingly to promote the views which he had adopted or origin
ated ; and to no man in Scotland is the progress which                   has been
made     in rational methods of teaching and in exalted views of school
discipline more indebted than to Professor Pillans.                   During his
long career,      first as  Rector of the High School of Edinburgh, from
1810   to 1820, and afterwards as Professor of Humanity, from 1820 to
1863, he is      universally and gratefully acknowledged            to have been

signally successful in his efforts to awaken the intelligence of boy
hood and youth — infusing into his pupils much of his own ardour and
classical refinement, and investing with interest and charm studies
too often presented to the minds           of youth in forms which         perhaps
justify    their aversion.      In noticing,     therefore,    the death of the
most venerable       of our members— one who connected this Society
with three generations— it is due to him to record the eminent
 educational services which he rendered to Scotland at large, and in
 an especial manner        to this city.      Professor    Pillans   received the
 degree of    LL.D.    from the University of Edinburgh             in 1863.      He
 entered the Royal Society          in 1811.       Like his friend Horner          he
 took a lively interest      in the School of Arts, and continued to              the
 last to attend     the examinations of the school of which                 he had
 been for some       time   President.      He was for many years senior
 member of the Senatus of the University of Edinburgh, and many
 of his former pupils were his colleagues.             Some years ago a dinner
 was given to him by his pupils, and a very large number of all
 ranks and professions assembled to do honour to their former in
 structor,   under the presidency of Lord Neaves,              one of his former
 duxes.     Among his writings        are the  following   : —
    1.  Principles of Elementary Teaching, chiefly in reference to
 the Parochial Schools of Scotland; in two letters to (his first

   In addition     to the above,    Mr Pillans has contributed        several
articles to the    " Edinburgh Review," chiefly     on education    ;  to the
"
  Encyclopaedia Britannica      ;" a speech on Irish education, in 1832      ;
evidence   printed in the Report of the Committee of the House of
Commons on Education, in 1834 ; and a Paper to the Royal Society
of Edinburgh on the Origin of the Adjective.
   Dr   Archibald Robertson, an English physician, died at bis
residence   at Clifton, on 19th October 1864, at the age of seventy-
four.   He was born at Cockburnspath,      near Dunbar, on 3d December
1789.     He was educated at Dunse school, and afterwards by Mr
Strachan, in Berwickshire.        He prosecuted his medical studies at
Edinburgh.       He passed assistant-surgeon in 1808, and was ap
pointed to Mill Prison Hospital at Plymouth, for French prisoners.
In 1809 he was appointed to the " Caledonia," Lord Gambier's flag
ship, Basque Roads, wheu       Lord Dundonald tried to burn the French
fleet.   He served in the Baltic, and afterwards in the West Indies,
in the   " Persian" and in the " Cydnus." He saw a good deal of
boat service    in the attempt on New Orleans.         At the peace with
North America he went on half-pay, having received a medal with
two clasps.     He graduated at Edinburgh in 1817 — his thesis being
on the    Dysentery of hot climates.      He settled in Northampton in
 1818, where he acquired a large practice.       In  1853 he retired from
active practice,     and went to Clifton to reside.     He   was  a learned
 and accomplished       physician, and, at the same time,    a most genial
and kind-hearted      gentleman.     He was  highly respected in North
 ampton,   and he enjoyed extensive       reputation   as a medical      man.

He was for many years Physician to the Northampton Infirmary,
to which he was elected in 1820. He wrote some papers for Forbes's
Cyclopaedia of Medicine, and he contributed         an article on Fever      to
the " Edinburgh Review."        He also wrote on the Contagion of          the
Plague and on the Quarantine Laws.               He reviewed      " Modern
Scepticism,"    "  Peter's Letters to his Kinsfolk," Mrs Brunton's
 " Emmeline."      He wrote Lectures on Civilisation, on the Wisdom
of God, and on the Living Principle in Plants, Animals, and Man.
He   was an  F.R.S., and joined the Royal Society of Edinburgh in
1836.     He was Vice-president of the British Medical Association
at the time of his death, and at the meeting of the Association              at
Northampton in 1844, he was chosen President.             He made     a large
fortune by practice.     He leaves one son, who is     a clergyman     of  the
Church of England.
   Dr Georok Smyttan      was  born at Dunkeld on 17th          June    1789.
He received his early education        at the grammar-school         of that
place, and studied at the universities of St Andrews and Edinburgh.
He took his diploma as surgeon at Edinburgh in 1808, and his
degree of M.D. at Aberdeen, when home from India on furlough.
In 1808 he went out to Bombay as surgeon in the service of the
H.E.I.C., and, including a year or so of furlough, remained in
India thirty years, by which time he had risen to the head of the
Medical Board.      He came home in 1839, bearing with him                 the
affection and esteem of a large circle of friends and associates,         and
the gratitude   of missionaries   and native     converts, affecting    testi
monies of which have been         received   since his death.       He    was
spared to see twenty-five years in his own country after his return,
sixteen of which were spent in zealous activity, promoting many
a  Christian enterprise, the remaining nine in the more difficult         ser
vice of patient submission under bodily weakness and inaction, the
effects of a paralytic seizure in September 1854.        At the  disruption
of the Church of Scotland, he warmly espoused the cause of the
Free Church, and to it     was  thenceforth     devoted a large share of
his energies and his substance.      In all its schemes he took a lively
interest, especially in its Indian    Missions.     But his philanthropy
was far from   being confined to denominational objects. Most of
the benevolent efforts of the day shared his liberality.          He was a

warm supporter       of the Medical-Missionary Society, the importance
of which he     was one of the first to recognise.      While not entering
deeply    into    science,  he was fond       of the study, and attended
assiduously     the lectures of Dr Fleming.          He entered the Royal
Society    in 1841, and when in health was a regular           attender of its
meetings.       His attachment to Dunkeld was warm, and showed it
self in substantial kindness.        Every summer was spent at Birnam,
till compelled to quit it in 1854. In 1860 he bought the small
property of Canaan Park, where his latter years were tranquilly
passed,   till Christmas    day 1863, when he died.
   Lieutenant-General Thomas Robert Swinburne was descended
from the     ancient family of the Swinburnes of Swinburne Castle, in
Northumberland.           His grandfather married Mary, co-heiress of
Anthony Meaburne of Pontop           Hall; his father married Charlotte,    co
heiress  of Robert Spearman of Old Acres, in the county of Durham,
and   he succeeded to these properties.           The estate of Marcus, in
Forfarshire,     he himself acquired by purchase.         General Swinburne
was   born in 1784.      He entered the    1st  Foot-Guards in 1813, served
with them      in Holland under Lord Lynedoch, subsequently in the
Peninsula      and South of France ; was in the campaign of 1815,
including the battles of Quatre Bras and Waterloo, the storming of
Peronne, where he commanded            a  storming party, and the occupa
tion of    Paris.     He retired from active service       on  an unattached
Majority,     and came to reside in Edinburgh, where he had received
part of     his education.     He became       a Fellow of the Society in
1839.     He   rose  through the various grades to the rank of Major-
General,    which     he attained   on  4th  June   1857,   and was gazetted
as   Lieutenant-General only        a few weeks before his death,       which
took place on 29th       February   1864.    General Swinburne,     though in
no   respect a cultivator of science, was, as a well-educated          gentle
man, deeply interested in all that concerned the progress of human
knowledge, and        will long  be  cordially remembered by those who
knew    him for his personal and social qualities, which made him a
typical specimen of the fine old English gentleman.
    Robert     Dundas    Thomson, M.D.,     F.R.S.L. & E.,    was second son
 of the Rev.     James Thomson,       D.D., minister of Eccles, Berwick

shire, in the manse of which parish he was born on the 21st                           Sep
tember 1810.           From the Grammar-school of Dunse he                     proceeded
to the University of Edinburgh,                where,    after   going through         the
usual arts course, he began the study of medicine.                           From Edin
burgh he went to Glasgow, where his uncle,                    Dr Thomas Thomson,
was      then professor of chemistry.
                                 He not only made every use of
the advantages which he there enjoyed of studying that science,
but became so much attached to     that  became the pursuit of
                                               it,       it
his life.
   Dr Thomson graduated at Glasgow in 1831, and, after voyage                   a
to India and China in one of the Company's ships, he settled                            in
London as physician. At the beginning of his career there, he was
                  a
associated with several active and zealous men, of his own standing,
in establishing the Blenheim Street School of Medicine, in which                        he
lectured on Chemistry. For short time he assisted DrFarr in editing
                                     a
the
    " British Annals of Medicine," and about the same time he un
dertook the publication of the " Records of Science."                      Active, enthu
siastic, and persevering, he had already got over the first difficulties
of   a   London practice, and was becoming known                  as   a   scientific phy
sician,      when he left London to take the place of assistant to his
uncle        at   Glasgow, whom      advancing        age compelled         to relinquish
first    a   part, and soon after the whole of the duties of the Chemical
Chair.        At Glasgow he was      a   most successful teacher, and acquired
the confidence         and esteem of the manufacturing body.                     In   1852
he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Chair of Chemistry, which
then became vacant.              He therefore returned to London, where                 he
was appointed Lecturer on Chemistry at St Thomas' Hospital. In
1855 he was elected Medical Officer of Health for the parish of St
Marylebone.           This was   a   new office just established             under Lord
Llanover's Act.          It   was an office for which his chemical,              medical,
and local knowledge            rendered him admirably            fitted.      Firm    when
needful, and at all times patient and conciliatory, he was able to
carry the vestry and householders                   with him.  The water supply,
the drainage,         the food, and the hygiene,          not only of the private
houses, but of the large public establishments                   of the parish,       were
all in their turn attended to         ;   and he was able by degrees to make
great        improvements      in the sanitary state of the parish.                    The
labour,       however, was enormous,           and began at last to tell on his

 once  vigorous constitution.       About two years ago his friends began
 to notice     his failing health, but it was only within the last six
months that      they became seriously alarmed.         Early in the summer
of 1864 he removed to the house of his brother            near Richmond, in
the hope     that change of air might restore him.         Unfortunately his
illness made      rapid progress, and he rested from his labours on the
17th   August last, to the inexpressible regret of a wide circle of
friends.
    Dr Thomson was an            accomplished    chemist.    His elementary
works   on that science (" School Chemistry" and the " Cyclopaedia
of  Chemistry") are of standard value, and he has enriched it by
numerous detached papers. His labours in physiological chemistry,
and on    sanitary questions, were of the highest value. The adul
teration   of drugs, the chemistry of digestion and of cholera, were
in turn   skilfully treated by him. He investigated most ably, under
the orders    of Government,      the nutritive value of the different kinds
of food for cattle.      The question of water supply he made especially
his own    ;  and his monthly analyses of the waters of the different
London companies, published           by the Registrar-General, were the
best safeguard       of the public.   He   was also an enthusiastic  meteor
ologist, and at the time of his death President of the Meteorologi
cal Society     of London.      He became    a Fellow of the Royal Society
of Edinburgh in 1850, and he was elected a Fellow of the Royal
Society of London on 1st June 1854. He was also a Fellow of
the Chemical        and Medico-Chirurgical      Societies of London, of the
Botanical Society        of Edinburgh, and of the Berwickshire Natural
ists'  Club, which he entered on 22d September               1831.  He con
tributed a paper on Tea-oil to the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
    Alexander Wood, Esq., late one of the Senators of the College of
Justice, Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, was born in Edin
burgh on the 12th November 1788.            He  was the son of George Wood,
M.D., and grandson          of the well-known Alexander Wood, surgeon
in Edinburgh.          His mother was Miss Campbell of Glensaddle,
through whom he was descended from the Earls of Crawford.
    He was a pupil of the      High School of Edinburgh, and afterwards
under    a clergyman       in the city of Durham. His later education
 was completed at the       University of Edinburgh.

310               Proceedings    of the Royal    Society
   He passed at the Bar in 1811, and was appointed Stewart of
Kirkcudbright in 1830. This office he resigned upon his election
as Dean of the Faculty of Advocates on 12th November 1841,
which honourable position he held but a short time, having, on 21st
November     1842, been appointed one of the judges of the Supreme
Court.    He became    a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in
1825.
   His learning and skill      as a counsel   were universally       acknow
ledged, and his practice while at the bar was large.         On the    bench
he was looked to by the profession        and the public as eminently
combining the wisdom of the judge with the polished courtesy                of
the gentleman.
   For several of the later years of his life his health was delicate,
and it was only the solicitation of those who knew and estimated
his high judicial qualifications which induced him to struggle with
indisposition and continue his services to the public.           He retired
from the bench in January 1862, thus terminating               a   long   and
honourable professional career.
   But while his duties in his profession and on the bench of          course
occupied him for many years almost exclusively, the short leisure
he could command        was most   cheerfully, though unostentatiously,
given to the public, especially in the cause of education and in the
 encouragement of art.
    His refined and cultivated taste pointed him out          as  peculiarly
 qualified to promote the advancement       of art in Scotland     ;  and,  as
 might   be expected, he was many years ago selected as a member of
 the Board    of Trustees    and Manufactures in Scotland,         to  whose
 proceedings he gave able co-operation,      taking   a leading part in    the
 remodelling of the School of Design, and acting as the convener
 of their committee for the erection and arrangements of the National
 Gallery and the promotion of its collections.            In early life, he
 showed his zeal in the cause       of general education, by taking         an
 active part in the institution of the Edinburgh Academy.
    Many years ago, the late Sir William Fettes nominated                him,
 along with others, including Mr Butherfurd, afterwards                  Lord
 Rutherfurd, and    Mr Corrie, Manager of the British Linen Company
 — all three fellow-students     and intimate friends of his deceased
 son— to   be trustees for carrying out  the"  Fettes   Endowment for      the

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1864-65.                      311

     maintenance,       education, and outfit of young people, whose parents
 have either died        without leaving sufficient funds     for that purpose,
 or who, from      innocent misfortune during their own lives,        are unable
 to give    suitable education to their children."
     Mr Wood had for many years been the sole survivor of the
original trustees ; and, with the aid of those who were from time
to time      assumed to     fill up the trust, he devoted much time towards
the execution          of the very ample powers conferred by the deed.
In this object he took the most lively interest, both from his
respect     for the venerable friend who had selected him, and from his
warm      interest in the cause of education.         In the careful manage
ment     of the large funds, and in the preparation of the scheme for
the establishment,           and of the rules for its management, Lord
Wood's prudence and experience qualified him to take the leading
charge     which he did.
     The guidance of his mature taste, also, was given in the selection
of   a  commanding        site for the intended building, and   in superintend
ing the beautiful plans prepared by            Mr Bryce, the architect.       The
adjustment of this, which           will ere long  be a most   important insti
tution, was a favourite occupation of Lord Wood during what leisure
he     could spare in his professional         and judicial  life, and to it he
gave even more           of his time and thoughts after his retirement.        He
lived to      know that the foundation of the Fettes           College was   laid,
although        the state of his health prevented         his presence on the
occasion.
     Those who knew him best are well aware that he would have
looked       upon    it  as one   of the most honourable     memorials     of his
name,       that it should     be remembered     in connection    with what he
did for the furtherance            and intentions of his old and highly re
spected      friend    as to  this endowment, which promises to         be one  of
 the greatest        ornaments     to the city, and benefits to many of its
sona.

    The Council reported on the remit made to them by the General
 Meeting of 28th November, in reference to Honorary Vice-Presi
dents, and recommended             that  those Fellows who had filled the
office of President should,         on retiring from office, become         Hono
rary Vice-Presidents — the designation being, "Honorary Vice-
President having filled the office of President."                They also re
commended that        His Grace the Duke of Argyll should             be elected
an Honorary Vice-President.

        Sib   DAVID BREWSTER,                       President, in the Chair.
The President, on taking the Chair, delivered the following
                                      Address : —
  In taking the Chair, to which, by your kindness,   have been ap  I
pointed, it may not be an inappropriate  introduction to its duties
      congratulating you on the prosperous state of the Society,
if,
in                                                                               I
should refer to some facts in its history, not generally known, which
have materially         contributed    to its prosperity    and progress.
  In the closing years of the last and in the first decade of the
present century, the Society was in very languid condition. In
                                                   a
each    of the years 1799, 1802, 1803, 1808, and 1809, only one of
the papers read at        its meetings      was published    in the Transactions   ;
and     in 1801    and 1806, not      a   single    paper read in these years was
published.
  While our Transactions              were thus scantily supplied with papers,
those    actually read were few in number, and often too abstruse to
excite    a   general    interest.     The regular meetings of the Society
had     frequently     no other business than to read the minutes, elect
members,       and receive donations         ;     and this was sometimes done in
the presenceonly of      Secretary and one or two members of
                               a
Council. Under such circumstances, the Secretary summoned the
members by  billet, printed with red ink when
                   a                            paper was to bea
read,    and one in black when he had nothing to communicate.
   voi. v.                                                             2    c

322                Proceedings  of the Royal Society
   At this time Sir George Mackenzie, Mr Skene, Mr Allan, and
myself— then office-bearers or members of Council, made arrange
ments that a paper of some kind should be read at every meeting,
and in this way a more numerous attendance was obtained.
   This abnormal      process, however, did not continue     long.   The
Huttonian Theory of the Earth, which its distinguished author
promulgated in our Transactions for 1785, had attracted the atten
tion of naturalists.     Sir James Hall, then   a young man, entered
with enthusiasm into its study, and     so early as 1790 he laid before
the Society certain views on the fusion and subsequent crystallisa
tion of mineral substances, which seemed hostile to the opinions
of his master. Having proposed to confirm them by experiment,
Dr Hutton,     as Sir James says, " gave him little encouragement ;"
and, under the influence of a false delicacy, he abstained from pro
secuting the subject during the life of his friend.       In 1798, how
ever, after   Dr Hutton's death, he resumed and published his ex
periments on the fusion of whinstone and lava ; and was led to
those admirable researches "on the effects of compression in modi
fying the action of heat," which he communicated to the Society,
and published in 1805.
    This remarkable     paper having removed many of the objections
which had been urged against the Huttonian theory, it was eagerly
embraced and defended by Professor Playfair, Lord Webb Seymour,
 Sir George     Mackenzie, Mr Allan, Dr Hope, and other geologists.
Professor    Jameson had about this time returned from Freyberg,
imbued with all the doctrines of the Wernerian School, and eager
to propagate      them   among  his pupils and friends.     Dr Thomas
 Thomson and Dr Macknight joined his standard; and the rival
 theories of fire and water were discussed in this Society with aU
 the warmth,    I  may even say the bitterness,   of political or theolo
 gical controversy.      Vanquished by the superior science of their
 opponents, the Wernerians quitted the field, and the Huttonian
 theory, illustrated by the eloquence of Professor Playfair, attracted
to its study the most distinguished geologists of other lands, and
took a high place among the natural sciences.
    Several   English geologists were thus led to establish the Geolo
gical Society of London ; and though, with the view of disarming the
 prejudices which had been excited against the Huttonian doctrines

                   of Edinburgh, Session 1864-65.                                323
they resolved only
                      " to collect the materials for future generalisa
tions," yet the great truths which had been established in Scotland
were soon accepted      and confirmed by the most eminent                    of their
number.
  If    our Society gained in popularity, and increased in numbers,
during the controversy to which        I have      referred,   it suffered   a serious
loss    by the retirement    of Professor      Jameson and his friends              to
the Wernerian Society which he had established in 1808. But
what was a loss to us was a gain to science. The new Society
enlisted in its service a number of young and active                    naturalists,
who enriched its Transactions with many papers of great interest
and value.
  If geology,    as a science, drew its     first breath within our walls,
by the active     labours of our colleagues,           the kindred science          of
mineralogy was, at the same time, earnestly studied and greatly
advanced.  Mr Thomas Allan, who possessed one of the finest col
lections in Scotland,   spared no expense in enriching      it with new
and rare minerals.      In   1808, a   Danish vessel, brought into Leith
as aprize, was found to contain a small collection of minerals,
which was purchased by Mr Allan, and Colonel Imrie, a Fellow of
this Society, and a contributor to its Transactions. Among these
minerals they found a large quantity of cryolite, a substance so
rare that at the market price     it would have brought L.5000. They
found    also crystals of gadolinite, sodalite,          and a new mineral,         to
which Dr Thomson, who analysed     gave the name of Allanite.
                                         it,
  These interesting minerals had been collected in Greenland by
Mr (afterwords Sir Charles) Gieseckl, during the mineralogical
survey which he had made of that country between 1805 and 1813,
and were shipped        by
                         him for Copenhagen in 1808. Upon his
arrival at Hull in 1813, with another and more valuable collection,
                                                   a
he learned the fate of his former specimens, and immediately pro
ceeded to Edinburgh,  where he was hospitably received by Mr
Allan, Sir George Mackenzie, and other members of this Society.
During his residence here he contributed papers to our Transactions,
and acquired so high     a   reputation as     a   mineralogist,     that, through
the interest of his friends     here, he was appointed to the Chair of
Mineralogy in the Royal Dublin Society.
  While the study of mineralogy was thus greatly promoted by the

 324                Proceedings    of the Royal    Society
labours and liberality of      Mr Allan, he had the good fortune,      at a
later period, to bring to Edinburgh, and receive under his roof for
nearly four years, a young German mineralogist of very uncommon
acquirements.       William Haidinger,     a native  of Vienna, who    had
studied mineralogy at Gratz under the celebrated          Frederick Mobs,
came to Edinburgh in 1823, and resided with           Mr Allan till  1826,
when he returned to Austria, where he prosecuted with ardour hie
geological and mineralogical studies, and where he now occupies            a
high place in the scientific institutions of Vienna.
   During his residence in Edinburgh, he published several valuable
papers in our Transactions,        and delivered a course of lectures    on
crystallography, at which Dr Edward Turner and other two friends
were the audience.       In claiming to have been one of his pupils at
these lectures,    I cannot  resist the gratification of claiming him    as
a pupil in that branch of optics, connected with mineralogy, which
was then ardently studied in every part of Europe.              When Mr
Haidinger returned to Vienna,        he prosecuted the study   of physical
optics with great zeal and success, and had the good fortune to
discover one of the most beautiful facts in that branch of science.
He   was the   first who observed that curious property of the eye by
which it discovers polarised light, and even the plane of its polari
sation, without any instrument whatever.            The cause of this re
markable phenomenon, called         " Haidinger's brushes," has not   been
discovered  ;   but there is reason to believe that it is produced    by a
structure in the retina, immediately       behind the foramen eenirak.
   Although the financial state of the Society was greatly improved
by the increase in the number of its members, yet its funds were
quite   inadequate to defray the necessary expenses of such an in
stitution.    The annual grant, therefore, of L.300, given in 1836 by
the Government of Lord Melbourne, though it enabled the Society
to pay the rent of its apartments,        left nothing for those   special
objects which such institutions        are expected to promote.     When
we consider that the     Royal Society of London has an annual grant
of L.1000, with free apartments in Burlington House, and a sum
for the royal medals,      we can  hardly doubt that an earnest     repre
sentation to the Government        would obtain for us a similar, though,
doubtless, a smaller grant.
   One of the most effective means by which a society like ours        can

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1864-65.                                  325
promote the interests            of science, is the adjudication of prizes to its
successful          cultivators.    The first bequest to us for this purpose
was made      by the late Mr Keith of Ravelston (long an office-bearer,
and      occasionally a contributor to our Transactions), who left

Transactions."
      In 1855, Sir Thomas Macdougall Brisbane, when President of the
Society, gave L.400 to found a biennial prize of L.30 to promote
any branch           of science to which the President and Council might
devote       it;    and in the following year Dr Patrick Neill bequeathed
L.500 to found a biennial or triennal prize, to be adjudicated                                to
the most       distinguished Scottish naturalist.              These prizes have been
gained by some individuals                     not Fellows of the Society, and have
procured       for our Transactions many valuable communications                       which
they would not otherwise have obtained.
      Unwilling to allow their prizes to remain unappropriated,                        it has
                of some societies to adjudicate them occasionally,
been the practice
contrary to the conditions imposed by the deed of foundation.
Such a proceeding             cannot be too carefully avoided.            It   is injurious
to the    society, by preventing the accumulation                   of the fund.         It   is
unjust to future competitors,                  who would otherwise      have received a
richer prize.           It   diminishes the importance of the prize by its too
frequent adjudication               ;    and    it prevents the wealthy patrons of
science from          intrusting money to an institution that does not                    re
spect the          conditions upon which it is given.
      In calling your attention to some of the leading features in the
history of the Society,                 I cannot    avoid expressing the regret which
has been  very generally felt at the discontinuance of those bio
graphical memoirs of distinguished members, which, during the
secretaryship of Professor Playfair, formed such an interesting por
tion of our Transactions.                       I   take to myself some blame, that
when     I    held the same office, no memoir                of Dugald Stewart, Pro
fessor   Playfair, and Sir James Hall should have                       been    communi
cated to the Society            ;   and the only apology       I   can offer   is,   that the
researches in          which  I         was engaged were too engrossing to admit
of any other occupation.                  The evil, however, may yet       be remedied,

 326              Proceedings       of the Royal Society
 and,  aa  suggested by a former Council, the Macdougall Brisbane
 prize might be given for important memoirs, such as that of Pro
 fessor Ferguson,    by  Mr Small, which has       been    published   in our
 Transactions.
    In calling your    attention   to the controversy between the Hut-
 tonian   and Wernerian      geologists,  as an epoch     in the history     of
the Society,   I referred to the prejudices      which it awakened,        and
the bitterness with which it was carried         on.    The formula of Dr
 Hutton, that " in the natural history of the earth there              was no
vestige of a beginning, and no prospect of an end," alarmed the
 timid, and furnished his opponents with a weapon which philo
sophers should disdain to wield. Dr Hutton observed,
                                                                   " that the
Mosaic history placed the beginning of man at no great distance,
and that there had not been found in natural history any docu
ment by which a high antiquity might be attributed             to the human
race."     He held no opinions and indulged in no speculations in
compatible with revealed truth, and his Scottish disciples, led by
Professor Playfair, maintained        the doctrines of their master with
out doing violence to the serious convictions        of their countrymen.
   It was   reserved for another school of geology to array the wis
dom of this world — Science falsely so called     — against truths     eternal
and immutable.       It  was reserved for an unscrupulous         philosophy
to hold an inquest on the origin of that life which God breathed
into man to make him        a  living soul, — to teach the heresy of       the
creation and government       of the universe by law ; thus hurling the
Almighty from His throne, — Himself but the first link of the chain
of life, — the sovereign of an empire without a sceptre, — the Father
of   a  family, blind to the tears, and deaf to the cries of his
children.
   Such views of the Divine Government            will, I  trust, never find
acceptance within these walls.         In the study of nature there is no
forbidden    ground.    Into its deepest mysteries we are invited           to
dive, and   if we make Reason our guide, and         Imagination our foot
stool, we may rest assured that truths that are demonstrated will
never rush into collision with truths that are revealed.

 1.  On   Variability in Human Structure, with illustrations
    from the Flexor Muscles of the Fingers and Toes.                    By
    William Turner, M.B. (Lond.), Demonstrator of Anatomy
    in the University.
    The author, after referring to variations in the external form of
the body    in different individuals, and to the relations between ex
ternal form and     internal structure, proceeded to discuss the subject
of variability in the different organic systems.         He showed that
internal structural variations conferred upon the individual char
acters as    distinctive as any  peculiarities in external configuration.
It  was  argued that in the development of the individual a morpho
logical  specialisation occurs, both in internal structure and external
form, so   that each man's structural individuality is an expression
of the   sum of the individual variations of all the constituent parts
of his frame.
    The muscular system was adduced as affording abundant illustra
tion   of the specialisation of structure in the individual, and an
analysis was given of a number of dissections of the flexor muscles
of the fingers     and toes.    In  the long flexors   of the thumb     and
fingers,  not only were variations in bulk, extent of attachment, and
mode    of division described, but the frequent existence and variously
modified arrangements of bands connecting together not only the
muscles, or    divisions of muscles, situated on the same plane, but
those situated     on different  planes were pointed out.    A  close ana
lysis of the arrangements         of the flexor hallucis longus,     flexor
longus digitorum, flexor accessorius, flexor brevis digitorum, and
lumbricales, in thirty dissected feet, was then given, and the extent
of variation    which these specimens exhibited detailed at consider
able length.      The necessity of dissecting carefully the soft parts in
 the different races of men, so as to study the amount of variation
 which might occur in them, was insisted on in the paper.

not to imitate      a   sound, he strongly contended, that the whole ori
ginal stock of language               was either           direct    imitations of     natural
sounds, or analogical representations                     of things visible and        tangible
by things audible.  As proofs of this he adduced various illustra
tions from the Aryan and the Semitic languages.   He showed spe
cially that most motions               are    accompanied            by certain    sounds or
noises, and these sounds are imitated more or less perfectly                               by   the
great family of verbs which express motion in all languages                             ;    that
objects which        are sharp or       blunt, rough or smooth to touch,                        are
expressed by words which               have the same character to the organs
of   speech    and to the ear    ;    and that there           is   a   distinct correlation
between all outward sensuous impressions and the emotions thereby
excited in our minds and nervous system, which necessarily                               causea
the vocal expression   of any feeling to bear    likeness to the ex a
ternal impression from which        proceeded.itHe did not consider
the scientific truth of this matter to be in any way affected    the                       by

3.   Note on the Phlogistic Theory.     By Alexander Crum
                     Brown, M.D., <fcc.
  When we consider that the Phlogistic Theory formed, as          were,                it
the central point round which the facts of chemistry first crystallized
into regular scientific form, and that for more than  hundred years        a
it was recognised by all as the foundation of the science, we might
reasonably suppose that          it   should contain at least some germ of truth.
I      think  I    shall   be able to show            in the following note that                not
only   is   this the       case, but that      the theory itself,          as stated        by   its
founders,      Beccher       and Stahl,       is,   if    not strictly true,   a   very      close
approximation        to what we now recognise as truth.

                           of Edinburgh,         Session 1864-65.                                329
      According to Stabl, all combustibles                    contain       one and the same
substance          in different proportions, according to the degree of their
combustibility.             That substance is phlogiston                ;   and when a com
bustible is burnt,          or   a metal     calcined,       its phlogiston       is given out.
When charcoal or oil is heated with a metallic calx, the phlogiston
leaves the former,               and is found in combination                  in the metallic
regulus.
      Now,       if we   consider the facts of the case in an unprejudiced way,
we     must admit that a combustible loses something when it is burnt,
it loses      combustibility, or the capability of being burnt    In the
same        way, in the preparation of phosphorus, or the reduction of a
metallic calx, the charcoal                  loses this capability, while the phos
phorus or metal acquires it.
     The capability of being burnt is essentially the power of emitting
a    certain quantity of heat, and, as we know from the researches of
Rumford, Davy, and others, and from the later and more accurate
determinations of            Joule, that heat is         a   particular form of what has
been        called kinetic energy, we can have no difficulty in admitting
that the power            of emitting   a certain    quantity of heat is a particular
form of potential energy.
     in the statement of the phlogistic theory, we read potential
      If,
energy for phlogiston, and understand that when phlogiston                                        is
separated from one body and not taken up by another, as                             in combus
tion, this potential          energy    is   converted into kinetic energy, we have
a   tolerably complete account of what we now know of the matter.
     Whether we choose, with Beccher and Stahl, to call phlogiston
substance or not, depends on our                 definition of what           a   substance       is, a
If    we restrict     that name to ponderable matter, of course       not           it      is    a
substance,         but when we consider that energy   as indestructible
                                                                   is     as
matter, that we can trace              it    through its various combinations                    and
double decompositions,              and that we are in
                                               fair way to discover,
                                                                  a
not, indeed, its atomic weight, for has none, but its chemical unit,
                                                it
itdoes not seem very absurd or unreasonable to class     along with            it
the    ordinary chemical elements.
    It   may be objected          to the phlogistic theory, as thus explained,
that   it   is   not the combustible alone, but the combustible and oxygen,
that have potential           energy, and that       it  only when the two unite
                                                             is
that this potential          energy    is   transformed into kinetic. This objec-
     voi. v.                                                                        2   x

330                   Proceedings   of the Royal        Society
tion is equally valid against the statement, that a clock, when wound
up, contains potential energy, it is not the clock, hut the clock                   aDd
the earth, which contain this, and         it is transformed when the          clock
weight and the earth approach each other.
   In    fact, energy is not conceivable without a system of at least two
bodies.
   We must, of course, recollectthat the phlogistic chemists were
ignorant of the existence and nature of oxygen, and it is to this
ignorance that we must ascribe the downfall of the theory of phlo
giston.       They attempted to explain, by means of this theory, facts
(such as      the increase of the weight of a combustible when burnt)
depending       on a totally different     cause.   They were thus led                to
modify the theory, and ascribe to phlogiston negative weight, and
to identify it sometimes with carbon and sometimes with hydrogen
gas.
   It   is not surprising that the theory, thus mutilated,           should     have
been overthrown,       and we have only to regret that the valuable truth
embodied in        it should have been lost sight of; that the antiphlo
gistic chemists, like other reformers, destroyed so much of what was
good in the old system, and that, in consequence of this, we are only
now beginning to see what was obvious to such a man as Stahl, that
oxide of iron does not contain metallic iron        ;   that no compound con
tains the substances from which it is produced, but that it contains
them minus something.     We now know what t his something       and          is,
can give      it   the more appropriate    name of potential energy; hut
there can be no doubt that this       is   what the chemists        of the    seven
teenth century meant when they spoke of phlogiston.

formidable analysis of Laplace and Poisson.                          Some curious     con

 3.        Notice respecting       Mr Reill/s Topographical Survey of
            the Chain of Mont Blanc.                 By Principal Forbes.
      On the 6th February 1843, or almost twenty-two years ago, I
had    the honour of laying before this Society an account of a topo
graphical survey of the Mer de Glace of Chamouni and its neigh
bourhood,       together with the detailed            map founded        upon   it,   being
probably the       first map of glacier on such
                                   a            scale ever constructed.

of the map appeared, containing the results of my continued ob
servations with the theodolite in 1843, 1844, 1846, and 1850. The
last edition (on       a   reduced scale), in 1853, included the whole of the
glacier of Bossons and the results of an extended triangulation, in
which the Flegere and the Breven formed the extremities of                        a    new
base       connected with the stations        of my former survey.

any farther personal exertions in elucidating the topography of the

 336                Proceedings        of the Royal      Society
 chain of Mont Blanc.          But  as opportunity     served, I have  not ceased
 to urge the younger        generation of Alpine travellers to extend our
 knowledge of its details, and, by making the theodolite their               com
panion, and multiplying panoramic views of all intricate mountain
groups, to obtain valuable           topographical     knowledge,   at the   same
time that they enjoy the luxury of Alpine rambling.                  The   south
western part of the chain of Mont Blanc, which really was very much
 a terra incognita as to     its interior conformation (though perpetually
visited on its outskirts by all who passed the Col du Bonhomme),
 was   partially explored and sketched by Mr Tuckett, an active
member of the Alpine Club ; but the district to the east of the Mer
de Glace, stretching        towards the Col de Balme          and the Swiss Val
 Ferret, remained      a complete      enigma,     the intricacy and obscurity
of which appeared more and more              as its recesses   were successively
 invaded by the adventurous inroads of members of the Alpine Club.
 For years   I had   been    urging my mountaineering friends to carry a
theodolite to the summit to the east of the Jardin, marked in my
map as
           " Nameless Peak A," from whence I knew that the de
batable land to the eastward would probably be overlooked                   ;  but
 it was not attempted         till 1863.     The year before, Sheet xxii. of
the Swiss Federal Survey had been issued, and was looked for with
great interest by myself and others as likely to clear up at least                a
part of the mystery of this Gordian knot of peaks and glaciers.                 So
far  as it was included      within the rigorous limits of the Swiss          Con
federation,    it was    as   completely     satisfactory   as that   survey   has
everywhere else been acknowledged              to be.     But the Federal   boun
dary once passed,       it  was evident      that the topography      of the   ad
jacent part of Savoy included in the Swiss sheet was far less reliable,
if indeed worthy of any confidence at all. The persuasion of the
uncertain state of the geography of this interesting portion of the
most important      mountain       group in Europe was common to myself
and others      who   had visited       or crossed    that   part of the chain.
Early in 1863      I  had the good fortune to make the acquaintance
of Mr Reilly, who was already interested in the problem, and who
shewed me panoramic drawings of different parts of the range,
executed    with remarkable          facility  and correctness.      He readily
agreed to return to the spot and take a             theodolite with him. The
map which      I now have his permission            to exhibit to the Society    is

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1864-65.                                           337
the result        of his labours in 1863, with some corrections                             and addi
tions in 1864.             It   starts fundamentally as a base with my trian-
gulation       of the Flegere and Breven                       stations,       and thus      connects
itself immediately              and accurately      with the whole of my map so
far as       it extended, that           is,   from the top of Mont Blanc to the
    Nameless Peak           A," parallel to the chain, and from the Jorasses
"
to the       Flegere in        perpendicular direction. Mr Reilly carried
                                a
forward       the main          triangulation up the valley of the Arve to the
Col de Balme,           and thence to the very recesses                        of the Glacier du
Tour,     which was the seat of at least one part of the " Gordian
knot" already referred to.                 He gradually found himself led to the
conclusion that the Sardinian surveyors,                            on whose authority the
Swiss map beyond                the limits of the Confederation                       was    probably
constructed, bad made                a   mistake          of   an   almost         incredible      kind,
representing one and the same mountain under the names of Aiguille
d'Argenti&re        and Pointe des Plines in two different places                        a   mile and
a-half apart, and separated by                  a   vast ice-field communicating with
the Glacier du          Tour, which ice-field has of course no existence,                             as
the two mountains,              by which       it   was   represented as being bounded,
are, as      already stated, absolutely              identical.       The portion of glacier
thus     annihilated was represented as two and    quarter English             a
miles    in length. Mr Reilly, whose activity as pedestrian  equal         a                  is
to his    skill   as   a   draughtsman,        put the seal         on his topographical            dis
covery  by passing for the first time the elevated col between the
Aiguilles of Argentiere and Chardonnet, starting from the side of
the glacier        of Argentiere.              Had existing maps been correct, he
would have       alighted on the glacier of Tour within the frontier of
Savoy    ;   but in effect he found himself on the glacier of Salena in
Swiss    territory.
    The western portion of the chain of Mont Blanc next engaged
his attention.    He was enabled by his extraordinary activity, and
his    skill in mountain drawing, to lay down with an accuracy far
beyond       any thing previously attained in that quarter, the whole
western      and southern faces of the chain, with the numerous vast
glaciers      which intersect these.             On the whole, the position of about
200 points was fixed by the theodolite,                          the position of one or two
fundamental            stations     (especially of Mont              Joli) having            been ob
tained from the            French engineers.

338                   Proceedings     of the Royal    Society
   In    the summer of 1864,        Mr Reilly revisited the chain of         Mont
Blanc with his map and theodolite, and was able to                   improve the
former at several points formerly obscure, particularly in the neigh
bourhood       of the southern      glacier  of Miage.       He gained great
additional insight into the details of the very heart of the wildest
parts of the range by ascending, all for the first time, three lofty
peaks previously unattained, the Aiguille d'Argentiere             and theMon-
delant to the eastward, and the magnificent            Aiguille     de Trelatete,
which      closely    approaches    Mont Blanc     on  the   south-west.        In
addition to this, he traversed this most difficult chain in two               new
directions from the       Jardin to the Glacier of Triolet        on the Italian
side, and again from the Col de Miage to the glacier of Bossons                 by
the Dome de Goute.
   Altogether, Mr Reilly has achieved the remarkable distinction
of presenting for the first time to the          eye  of the tourist      and the
physical     geographer a correct and skilful delineation            of the  most
remarkable and most elevated mountain              chain in Europe.         Three
different     states,   France,   Sardinia,   and   Switzerland,      divide   the
chain between them.           Of these, Switzerland alone has given any
thing to the world in the least degree worthy of the spot, and that
unfortunately       only embraces     a secondary part.       It   is a singular
chance which has enabled a British amateur to produce a work                     so
creditable     and so long desired.        Let  us hope that      no. delay will

4.   On the Solution of Perigal's Problem concerning the
       contact of Epicycloidal Curves.              By E. Sang, Esq.
   If   the centre of a revolving         wheel be carried with a uniform
velocity, along a line      ; and  if a tracing-point   be fixed to an arm of
the wheel, that point         will trace out   a curved   line  ;  to which    the
general name cycloid or trochoid has been given           ; the former appel
lation being often restricted to those cases in which the centre of
the wheel moves in a straight line, while the name epicycloid is
given when the same centre moves along the circumference of a
circle.
   When the tracing-point is placed very close to the centre of the
wheel, the curve is slightly undulated ; the depth of the waves,

other things remaining the                             same, increases        with the distance of the
tracing-point from the centre.                              As that distance is augmented the
curve at last becomes cusped as                             in the common cycloid traced by a
nail in the tire of a cart wheel. If the distance of the tracing-point
be still farther augmented, the cycloid becomes looped ; the loops
become wider, and come each to touch that loop adjacent to it on
either side.
   MrPerigal's problem                           is,   to determine the conditions         under which
this contact of the loops takes place.
   If the arm of the revolving wheel                                  be   still farther lengthened, the
loops come to touch those removed from them by two, by three, or
by any number of steps, so that the problem may admit of many
solutions.
   Mr Perigal has obtained the solution of this problem in                                       a   con
siderable variety of cases,                            by help of mechanical           appliances,   and
has exhibited them in his beautiful series of machine-engraved                                       epi
cycloids, or bi-circloids, as he calls them.
   The most comprehensive view of the genesis of epicycloidal
curves  obtained by supposing two arms, OA and OB, to turn with
          is
uniform velocities on                    a   com
mon centre             0,    just   as do the
two hands of                a    watch,          and
by supposing the rhomboid
OAPB        completed                   at   each
instant;         the point              P    then
traces an epicycloid.
  If the angular                 velocities of
the two arms                be represented
by a and         /3,   while the lengths
are   A   and          B,   the directions
of these arms at any instant
of time   are represented by
           t,
at and    /J<.         It   is   shown that
if
T     be the time correspond
ing to the contact of one loop with another,                                     we must have the pro
portions

so  that the solution of the problem resolves itself iuto that of this
trigonometrical question, " To find two circular arcs in a given ratio
and of which the tangents are     in  the same  ratio."
   The solution of this question, again, resolves itself into that             of
algebraic   equations     of the order   J(a +/3 —
                                                    3) or  J(a + |S - i), when
a and    /? are  represented by integer numbers         prime to each other.
A table of the solutions for all possible values of a and up to ten
is given ; and it is remarkable that these solutions apply whether
the motions of the two arms be in the same or in opposite direc
tions.
   The problem is then extended to the case of the common cycloid
in which the centre of the revolving wheel moves along a straight
line.    Here it is shown that we have to discover those arcs which
are equal in length to their own tangents         ; and that the revolving
arm must      be  made proportional      to the secants of these arcs.         A
table of the first ten solutions is appended to the paper.

1. Exhibition of Three Skulls of the Gorilla, received from
   M. Du Chaillu, with Observations relative to their Ana
   tomical Features. By Dr Burt and Mr W. Turner.
   After placing on the table a series of three crania of the gorilla
{Troglodytes gorilla), which he had a short time ago received from

342               Proceedings       of the  Royal Society
M. Du Chaillu, Dr Burt proceeded to relate to the            Society   several
facts, recently come to light, in support of various of the       statements
of that traveller which had been called in question.              He   alluded
to the doubts which had been cast on several of the            statements of
M. Du Chaillu, and       to the uncourteous     treatment he had     received
at the hands of some of his detractors, and enumerated some of               the
proofs since    produced    by that    gentleman,    which   are   now to      be
found in the British       Museum,     and in the possession of        men      of
distinction in science, illustrative of the natural history and               the
habits of the people of Equatorial Africa, which confirmed                    the
veracity of that gentleman's       observations.   The last letters   received
from M. Du Chaillu were written from Fernand Vaz                  previousto
his departure for the interior.
    In giving an account of the anatomical           features of the crania
which Dr Burt had entrusted to him for examination, Mr                  Turner
stated, that as the elaborate memoirs of Professor Owen, Dr Wyman,
MM. Duvernoy and I. 6. St Hilaire, were within the                    reach of
every comparative anatomist, it was needless for him to go into              any
detailed description    of the characters of the skull of the           gorilla.
But   as the crania were those of     an  adult male, an adult female,       and
a young female, it might be interesting to record the specific               and
sexual characters, and the differences between the young and               adult
forms,    and so   assist in establishing the relative       constancy       and
variability of   some     of the most     important    anatomical    features.
The skulls of an adult male and female, and          a younger chimpanzee
(Troglodytes niger), were at the same time exhibited, and           compared
with those of the gorilla.*       The description, unless when      otherwise
stated, applied to crania personally       examined.
    In  size, the skulls of the adult male and female gorilla               were
larger than those of the corresponding         sex in the chimpanzee,        and
the adult female gorilla was larger than the adult male chimpanzee.
   * The crania of the adult male and younger chimpanzee are in the Anato
mical Museum of the University ; that of the adult female is in the possession
of Dr John Alexander Smith.      In the adult and apparently aged chimpaniee
crania the sutures were all ossified.  In the younger animal, although all the
permanent teeth had erupted, yet the sutures of the cranial vault were unossi-
fied, and tho basi-cranial   synchondrosis, though ossified, had its position
marked by a transverse bony ridge.

The massiveness of the supra- and inter-orbital ridges, and their
greater size even       in the female gorilla than in the male chimpanzee,
and the     influence which their great elevation exercised in conceal
ing the frontal part of the cranial vault,            were pointed    out :  only
in the young gorilla, and that very slightly, did the frontal vault
come into       view, when the skull was looked at from before          ;  in all
the three chimpanzee             crania the frontal vault could    be seen from
that point       of view.       The sagittal and occipital crests were abso
lutely and relatively larger in the adult male than in the female
gorilla.      These three massive ridges mounted up and converged at
the summit of the posterior end of the cranium.                    The original
bilaterality of the sagittal crest was marked in the male by a median
depression        in its anterior third, subdividing it into two parallel
ridges    ;  and quite at its posterior end it bifurcated, where it became
continuous with the two halves of the lambdoidal                crest, and when
seen   from the basal aspect, it seemed like a beak in the centre of
 the rounded       occipital outline. The great projection of the lambdoidal
 crest   rendered the under surface of the occipital bone concave,
 though     it was traversed by strong ridges, evidently for the attach
 ment    of powerful muscles.           The posterior margin of the foramen
 magnum was 3£ inches from the posterior end of the sagittal
 crest.      In the female the sagittal crest was very little raised
 above the surface          of the conjoined parietals : the lambdoidal crests
 were    much smaller than in the male gorilla, but larger than in the
 male chimpanzee          ;  the occipital outline rounded, but with no central
 projecting beak.           In the young gorilla the two temporal ridges did
 not meet      in the middle line     : at their point of closest approximation
  they were one inch apart          ; hence there was no sagittal crest.      The
  occipital crest was feeble, and was joined somewhat more than one
  inch to the outer side of the            middle  line by the faintly-marked
  temporal     ridge. Occipital outline rounded, under surface of the bone
  convex,     approaching in form to that of the chimpanzee ; posterior
  margin     of foramen magnum 1-9 inch from centre of the occipital
  crest.    In all the three chimpanzee crania the temporal ridges
  never coalesced       :   in the adult    male, in which they most closely
  approximated, their nearest points were upwards of an inch apart.
    In the adult male and female gorilla the cranial sutures were
  almost    entirely obliterated.         In  the young   animal   they were all

   344                Proceedings    of the Royal Society
   very distinct.     The ali-sphenoid was pointed superiorly, and sepa
   rated from the parietal by the articulation of the squamous part of
   the temporal with the frontal.         This arrangement was also traced
   in the chimpanzee, and seems to be the rule in the crania of these
   anthropoid   apes.    In  the orang, on the other hand, the articulation
   of the ali-sphenoid superiorly varied in different specimens. Of four
   crania examined, — in one the ali-sphenoid on each side articulated
  with the corresponding parietal ; in one a tongue-shaped process
  of the squamous part of the temporal articulated with the frontal,
  and cut off the ali-sphenoid from the parietal          ; whilst in the     other
  two crania,    the ali-sphenoid articulated       with the parietal on        one
  side of the skull only, for on the other side a tongue-shaped            process
  of the temporal was intercalated        between them.       In two crania of
  the gibbon, again, a well-marked articulation existed between the
  ali-sphenoid and the parietal on both sides of         each   skull ; whilst    in
  a  third, on the left side,    a narrow tongue     of the temporal,       reach
  ing the frontal, was intercalated      between the ali-sphenoid and the
 parietal, and on the right side the tongue of the temporal projected
 into, but not quite across, the ali-sphenoid, so that the latter was
 still, though slightly, in communication with the parietal.                If  the
 tongue of the temporal had passed quite across the ali-sphenoid,
 then the upper end of this bone would have been cut off, and would
 have formed a triquetral bone in the temporo-parietal              suture.      In
 man, the rule is for the ali-sphenoid to articulate with the anterior
 inferior angle of the parietal, and thus to cut off the frontal              from
the squamosal      ;  but exceptions not unfrequently occur, and crania
seen by the author were referred to, not only in the Negro, Hot
tentot, Caffre, Bushman,        Sandwich Islander, and Australian           races,
but also in Hindoos, Ceylonese, and Europeans               (French, Scotch),
in which      a tongue-like process of the squamosal passed between
the ali-sphenoid and parietal to articulate with the frontal.*
    * Although it would appear from an examination of a considerable number
of crania of old-world monkeys that the rule is in them for a tongue-shaped
process of the temporal to articulate with the frontal,  and consequently to cut
off the ali-sphenoid from the parietal, yet several crania have been noted in
which the ali-sphenoid and parietal had a well-marked articulation with each
other.    Some of these skulls had unfortunately not been named, and it was
difficult exactly to identify them ; but in a skull of Semnopithecus entettut, and
in one of Macacut cynomolffut, the ali-sphenoid articulated on both sides with

    In  the young      gorilla, the squamous part of the occipital                bone
curved    upwards and forwards for more than one inch                    beyond the
rudimentary occipital crest, and contributed              therefore to the forma
tion of the posterior part        of the vault of the skull.            In  the adult
animal the whole of this part of the bone was overlaid with the
bony growth met         with at the junction of the sagittal and occipital
crests.    The angle formed by the junction of the two sides of the
lambdoidal suture was well marked                in the young gorilla.         In   the
younger chimpanzee a small fontanelle                bone existed at each of the
two extremities       of the sagittal suture,* the squamous part of the
occipital bone scarcely extended              above the rudimentary occipital
crest, and the lambdoidal         suture passed across the back of the head
in a line approaching        much more closely to the horizontal than in
the gorilla.     The basi-cranial synchondrosis was ossified in the adult
animals,    but not in the young gorilla.            The zygomatic arches and
mastoid     processes closely corresponded with the descriptions                 given
by Professor Owen.         In the adult male and young gorilla the eusta
chian    process of the petrosal (marked e in Owen's figure, plate
lxiii.) was little more than a well-marked tubercle ; but in the adult
female it was prolonged downwards for half an inch as a well-formed
styliform process.
the parietal ; and though      in two crania of Cynocephali the temporal and
frontal  articulated,  yet in a  third, whilst they articulated on the right side,
on the left the ali-sphenoid joined the parietal.        In crania of the following
American monkeys, — Ateles, Cobus, Hapale, — the parietal bone not only arti
culated with tho ali-sphenoid,    but with the protuberant malar bone.          Various
anatomists   (Owen, Humphry, &c.) have referred to Negro and Australian crania
in which the temporal and frontal articulated.        Barnard Davis has also figured
an Anglo-Saxon      skull from Ozingell,      Kent  (Crania Britannica, pi. 88), in
which the same arrangement occurred.            From the number of human crania
referred to  in the text in which this articulation was seen, it may apparently
exist in the skulls of any race    aa an individual peculiarity.       The triquetral
bone, not unfrequently   met with in the sphenoido-parietal suture by separating
these bones from each      other, mny be regarded as an approximation to this
arrangement.      The occasional occurrence, therefore, of the articulation of tho
frontal with the squamous part of the temporal bone in human skulls, and
the extent of variation the ali-sphenoidal articulation exhibits in the crania
of apes, gives to this feature but   little value in the discrimination   of the diag
nostic characters between the crania of men and monkeys.

     The anterior        nostrils in the gorilla in form approached a four-
  sided figure, with the angles rounded off.              The boundary between
  the nostril inferiorly, and the alveolar part of the premaxillae was
  not very sharply defined.           In   the young     gorilla, also, the lateral
  boundaries      formed by the ascending           processes of the premaxillae
  were much more rounded than in the adult.                In  the chimpanzee the
  anterior nares were triangular in form.             The difference in shape     iu
 these two species of anthropoid            apes was due to the different     mode
 of termination        of the ascending processes of the premaxillae supe
 riorly   ;  and as   this is a character on which Professor Owen has laid
 great stress,     it is as well to note, that in all these gorilla's crania,
 as in those     which he has described, the upper end of the ascending
 process of each premaxilla was intercalated              as a  triangular plate of
 bone between the nasal and superior             maxilla.    This could  be readily
 traced both in the young skull and in that of the adult male, in
 which the naso- and maxillo-premaxillary sutures were visible, and
 in the adult female though the sutures were ossified, for lines on
 the bones indicated          their original position.        In the skull of the
younger chimpanzee, in which alone the sutures persisted, and that,
too, only at the ascending part of the premaxilla, the upper pointed
end of that bone articulated            with the lower end of the nasal,        and
was    not intercalated between it and the superior maxilla.*
    In   the gorillas' crania the nasal bones were narrow, compressed,
and projecting superiorly, and raised along their line of coalescence
into   a crest.      In  the young animal        it could  be seen that  they  pro
jected      upwards     into the interorbital process of the frontal ; and
in this specimen a line, looking at first like a suture, but really
only    a groove, probably        for  an   artery or a nerve, seemed to cut off
    * In the crania of the orangs and of the gibbons an arrangement of the upper
end of the premaxillffi, closely similar to that described in the chimpanzee,
was seen. In only one skull of the orang did a linear process of the premaxilla
 pass upwards for yVths of an inch        between the nasal and superior maxilla.
Hence the intercalated triangular       plate at the upper end of the premaxilla of
the gorilla is valuable as a diagnostic character to distinguish the skull of that
animal not only from the skull of the chimpanzee, but from those of the other
anthropoid     apes.    In the mode of termination, however, of its premaxillaj
superiorly    the  gorilla closely corresponds with the arrangement seen in the
skulls of many of the tailed apes, «. g., Cynocephalus, Semnopithecus, Cerco-
pithecus.

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1864-65.                              347
                                                                                 -.
 the more expanded           interorbital part from the narrower crest-like
 portion.*      In  the chimpanzee the nasal region was much flattened.
     The interorbital region was in the gorilla wider near the floor
than the     roof of the orbit, and the fossa for the lachrymal              sac was
directed     forwards.       In the chimpanzee      there was little difference
in the    width of the interorbital region at the floor and at the roof,
the   fossa for the lachrymal sac was directed outwards, and was con
cealed by the sharp edge           of the inner end of the lower margin of
the orbit.       In   the gorilla the os planum of the ethmoid               was    an
elongated     triangular plate of bone       : in the young skull its apex did
not reach      the lachrymal bone, so that             the orbital plate      of the
superior maxilla articulated           with the frontal.      In  the adult crania
the ossa plana articulated         with the lachrymal bones.f
    In all the crania of the gorillas the infra-orbital canals,               as was
first noticed by       Agassiz, shallowed, and almost disappeared            as  they
approached       the spheno-maxillary fissures        :  in the chimpanzee they
remained deep throughout,             and in the male were quite, and in the
younger animal almost, bridged over by a plate of bone posteriorly.
    Owing to the comparative straightness             of the alveolar portion of
the premaxillae, and the more elevated and elongated                    nasal bones
of the gorilla, the profile outline of its face may be represented by
a   much more direct line than is possible in the chimpanzee,                        in
which the deep nasal depression,               lying between the interorbital
and alveolar        projections,    gives a deeply concave character to the
profile   outline.      In  the profile view of all these gorillas' crania, not
only was the       outline of the nasal bones visible, but the lachrymal
fossa,   and a    portion of the inner wall of the orbit behind the fossa.
    In the skulls of the gorilla the emarginate form of the posterior
   * Dr Wyman        states that in the crania he has examined there are indica
tions of a suture separating the lower part of the nasals from the       intor-orbital
part, the latter of   which he looks upon as an additional       osseous element    in
tercalated   between the frontals.     May not such a groove    as the one described
in the text have been regarded as a suture       ?
    t So far as could be judged from the skull of the younger chimpanzee, in
that animal the ethmoid did not articulate       with the lachrymal by its anterio
margin,    the superior     maxillary and frontal    having   processes  intercalated
between.     In  the orangs and gibbons, again, the ossa plana were quadrilateral
plates, and articulated     by their anterior margins with the posterior margins
 of the lachrymal    bones.

 margin of the hard palate was well seen.                  In the male gorilla,      the
depth of the posterior nares was almost twice as great as the breadth                    :
in the female the vertical            diameter was not so great as the trans
verse.      In   the young, one diameter almost equalled the other.                   In
the adult male, and younger chimpanzee,                  the breadth exceeded the
depth     ; in the female the two diameters             were   equal.     The ratio     of
depth to breadth at these orifices was not, therefore, so definite                  as in
the skulls described by Professors Owen and Wyman.
     In  the lower jaws the following leading characters were noted :—
 Absence of chin         ;   backward      and downward       slope  of jaw from       its
 incisive margin ; presence of a strong buttress of bone on the inner
 aspect of symphysis; passage of horizontal into ascending ramus
 by a gentle curve         ;  alveolar margins for molar and premolar teeth
 almost parallel       ; long axes of condyles almost transverse.
     In the skull of the young gorilla various points illustrating                 pecu
liarities in the dentition were noticed.                In  the upper jaw the per
 manent      incisors     had emerged, the central          pair being larger than
 the lateral pair.         The milk canines        were shed, but the apices of the
 permanent canines bad only reached the orifices of their alveoli, the
 teeth being       still buried in the jaw       ;  the septum originally situated
 between the sockets for the temporary and permanent                      canines was
 in   a great    measure absorbed        :   the diastema between the lateral in
 cisor and canine, so strongly marked in the adult male and female,
 but more especially             in the former,      had not yet originated        ;  the
 septum between the sockets for those teeth was but                     little thicker
 than that between the alveoli for the lateral                  and central incisor,
 and the maxillo-premaxillary               suture passed along the middle line
 of this septum.*            The premolars had each two cusps, the external
 of the anterior, and the internal of the posterior being the larger:
 each     premolar      had three fangs, a larger         internal and two smaller

  appear as   if  the premaxilla    and the canine portion of the superior maxillary
 bone participated iu an equal degree, for the maxillo-premaxillary           suture  was
  mostly situated, in the adult jaw, about midway between the canine and
  lateral incisor teeth. In others, however, e. g., severul cynocephali, the suture
  was placed much nearer the canine tooth, and the interval          was occasioned     by
  an increased growth of the premaxilla         between that suture and the socket for
  the lateral incisor.

external.        In the chimpanzee            crania   the fangs of the premolars
differed somewhat from those         of the gorilla, for though each of the
first      pair possessed   three fangs, those of the second had only two
fangs, an      external and an internal          ;   and in this respect, therefore,
they presented a closer approximation                   to the arrangement             of the
fangs of the premolars in man than did the gorilla.
  In the young gorilla the first and second pairs of true molars
were fully erupted ; each tooth was quadricuspid ; the anterior in
ternal      was connected to the posterior external cusp by an oblique
ridge.       The third true molars were concealed within their alveoli.
  In the lower jaw of the young gorilla the permanent incisors
were erupted : the left milk canine was in its socket, and close to
it, its lingual side, was
      on                  foramen which led into
                                         a          canal that           a
communicated with the crypt containing the permanent canine                                 ;
the foramen and canal            marked       the position of the gubernaculum.
The right milk canine was shed, but the permanent tooth was deep
in    its alveolus,     and the bony septum between the socket for the
milk tooth and the gubernacular                 canal was    still unabsorbed.           The
diastema       which existed on each side of the canine, but more                       espe
cially on the premolar aspect in the                 adult crania, had not been           de
veloped in the young            skull.       The first pair of premolars           was con
siderably larger than the second, each tooth possessed                       an anterior
and     a   posterior   The first and second pairs of true molars

molars was still concealed within the jaw.   The eruption of the
permanent canines in the upper jaw precedes, therefore, their ap
pearance       in the lower jaw      ;   but in both the upper and lower maxillae
the permanent canines            follow in their 'eruption the first and second

  2.   Notice of a Remarkable Piece of Fossil Amber.                  By Sir
                       David Brewster, K.H., F.R.S.
     The piece of amber, now on the table, was found in the kingdom
of Ava, and sent to me from India by the late Mr George Swinton,
to whom the Society was indebted           for many interesting objects of
natural history from that country.           It  weighs   2} lbs., and  in its
general aspect seems to differ considerably from the ordinary speci
mens of amber.         The remarkable fact, however, which distinguishes
it from all the specimens of amber          I have seen or read of, is, that
it is intersected in various directions by thin veins of a crystallised
mineral substance. These veins are in some parts of it as thin as
a sheet     of paper, and in other parts about the twentieth of an
inch thick. In order to determine the nature of the mineral I
extracted a portion       of the thickest vein, and having obtained, by
cleavage, a      small rhomb,  I  succeeded in measuring the inclination
of its planes, and found it to be carbonate of lime.
     Pieces of amber of 2 or 3 lbs. weight are very rare. A specimen
weighing 1 lb. is valued in Prussia at 50 dollars. The largest piece
 yet found is in the Royal Museum at Berlin ; it weighs 18 lbs.,
 and is said to be worth upwards of 7000 dollars.
     3.   On the Cause and Cure of Cataract.                By Sir David
                Brewster, K.H., F.R.S. Lond. and Edin.
     The author's attention    was called to    this subject in consequence
 of having had an attack of incipient cataract forty years ago. The
 laminae of the lens had separated so much as to exhibit rays of
 light, and the prismatic colours, round every source of light.         At the
 end of eight months the lamina? came into optical contact, the rays

 and colours disappeared, and the eye became as perfect as the other,
 — a proof that cataract, in its incipient stage, may be discovered opti
 cally, and may be cured.         During a series of experiments on the
 changes    in the crystalline lenses of animals after death, the author
 observed    that the capsule of the lens transmitted water into the
lens  till it burst   ; and hence he concluded that cataract might arise
from    an unhealthy state of the aqueous humour,             — hard cataract
from    too much      albumen in the aqueous humour, and soft cataract
from    too much water.        The aqueous humour         should  therefore   be
evacuated,      in order that nature        might supply     a more healthy
secretion, or an artificial aqueous humour should             be injected   into
the aqueous chamber,         — operations that may       be easily and safely
performed.       The evacuation of the aqueous humour            was  long   ago
tried with safety forty times on the same patient, in the Manchester
Infirmary, for conical cornea; and the author of this paper has
learned, since it was read, that M. Casimir Spirone of Turin has
cured numerous        cases  of cataract by the evacuation of the aqueous
humour, repeated thirty, forty, and even ninety times.
4.   On the      Hill    Forts, Terraces,     and other remains         of the
   Early Races in the South of Scotland.                  By W. Chamhers,
    Esq. of Glenormiston.
   The district referred to included Roxburghshire, Selkirkshire,
and Peeblesshire, in which Mr Chambers had visited and examined
about 200     hill forts.    These   ancient  works    are found on the tops
of hills of moderate elevation, and are of different classes, shewing
a progressive      improvement      in construction.     Those of the smaller
kind consist of one or two concentric         rings of earth and stone, with
a  clear space in the centre,         and measure      from 150 to 250 feet
across.     Such    are   considered   to be the earliest    in construction,
and are at the least 2000 years old, though              they may have been
kept in use later.        Their first constructors   were unquestionably     the
aboriginal Celtic tribes, to whom they served as places of refuge
and   defence in petty local wars, or on the occasion of invasion.
Originally, the entrenchments or rings may have been ten to fifteen
feet in height, but now lying in ruins and covered with sward ;

352                    Proceedings            of the Royal        Society
their height         is seldom       more than four or five feet.                Between these
very ancient         forts and those in other parts of Scotland there is                         so
little difference, that they may all                    be imputable          to the same early
races.
     The hill forts of          a more advanced           kind demonstrate              such skill
in construction, that they may fairly                     be referred to a period coeval
with and subsequent to the Roman                             invasion.         Like the       lesser
forts, they are all circular or oval in form, but they comprehend
four or even five concentric entrenchments with deep intervening
ditches,       zigzag entrances, which an enemy would find it
               and
difficult to penetrate in the face of a body of defenders. The
height of the         still surviving rings in some of these forts is                     as much
as twenty-five       When constructed, the walls would of course
                       feet.
be much higher, and supplemented with stockades of wood, wattle,
and the skins of animals, as was the case with the hill forts of the
Gauls,        described by Casar.               In   several instances,          Mr Chambers
had found           exterior        defences,       in the     form      of    high     ramparts,
making         an    irregular sweep, so             as to enclose       six or seven         acres.
Such enclosures were probably designed for the reception of cattle.
Two of the more remarkable of these elaborate forts                               are   Milkiston
Rings, near Eddies ton, and Henderland-hill Rings, parish of New-
lands     ;   both had evidently been designed to guard the great passes
from the east — that                is,   to stem     the tide of invasion of Angles,
Frisians, and others approaching from the German Ocean.
   Of the origin of the hill forts in the south of Scotland, the                                pre
sent inhabitants           can give no account.               Generally they are           spoken
of   as   being Danish — curious error arising from
                                 a                                        a    misapprehension
of the legendary term Dinas, which in the original British signified
fortress, and    still so applied in Wales.
                      is                      This word Dinas                                      is
found under   varying forms in many ancient languages, and                                        is
the original of the names of places in Scotland corruptly called
Tinnies.  While the forts in questiou are not Danish, neither are
they Roman, as             is   evident     from their peculiar form.                 After    com
paring them with                a   Roman     camp —     a   castra stativa — at Lyne, Mr
Chambers            proceeded to describe               the Catrail, or great            barricade

    He then gave some account of the      hill terraces of the early races,
 of which there had been      numberless   speculations    ;  he agreed with
 recent  inquirers in thinking     that they were simply designed           for
 horticultural   and  agricultural purposes.        Mr Chambers,        lastly,
 drew attention    to the rudely shaped monumental             stones in the
 Vale of Tweed, on which he had found             no elaborate or artistic
sculptures, such as occurred in northern districts.          Recent   investi
gations concerning upright stones have happily put to flight a
variety of those     mythic legends     and    fables  which were at no
distant date the reproach       and pollution of our topographic          lite
rature.    As regards the whole of the interesting memorials of past
times which had been adverted to, Mr Chambers trusted that the
Society would join with him in the wish that land proprietors
would, as    far as practicable,  make some effort for their preserva
tion.

At the request of the Council Mr Geikie gave the following
   Account of the Progress of the Geological Survey in Scot
   land, illustrated by Maps and Sections: —
   The object of the Geological Survey is to ascertain in detail the
geological structure     of the United Kingdom, and to publish the
results in maps, sections, and descriptive memoirs.            The Ordnance
maps form the groundwork on which these geological investigations
proceed;    and as no district is examined     until these maps     are ready,
the progress   of the Geological Survey is guided in no small degree
 by that   of the Ordnance      engineers.    In  Scotland, the. geological
mapping has       hitherto been conducted        wholly upon the county
maps   on the scale of six inches to a mile, and the advantages of
so large a scale are such, that although       the work is finally reduced

356                Proceedings     of the Royal   Society
and published on the scale of one inch to a mile, no connty is sur
veyed until its six-inch maps are ready for use.          By this   means a
much     more detailed     and accurate map is given than        if  all the
minutias of a difficult district had to be surveyed upon so small           a
scale as that of one inch to a mile.
    The survey of Scotland        was begun by Professor    A. C. Ramsay,
the local director,    towards the close of 1854.       East Lothian     was
selected as the point of commencement             best suited for the in
vestigation    of the Lothian coal-fields,     and the work was carried
steadily westward from the older Silurian rocks into the coal-basin.
 Much inconvenience        arose, however, from the backward state of
the Ordnance maps.         In Haddingtonshire,    all the sheets were un
finished,   and    those   of Berwickshire were not        even  engraved.
Hence the map containing the earliest          labours of the survey   — the
geology of East Lothian — had to lie aside for several years until
the Ordnance sheets of Berwickshire could be obtained to complete
it.    The westward progress of the survey was at last abruptly
stopped by the want of the maps of Stirlingshire.           The work was
then transferred to Fife, and nearly the whole of that county and
of Kinross    was completed by the end       of the year 1861.    But only
the eastern part could bo published ; nor was it until last spring
that the sheets of Perthshire, still far from being complete, were
obtained to allow      of the Fife work being finished.       That map      is
now in the hands of the engraver.
    As no further advance could       be made either to the  north or   west,
the only available     direction   was the south.     Accordingly, in     the
early part of 1802, the survey of Peeblesshire        and Lanarkshire was
begun, and at the end of 1863, an area of 432 square miles was
ready for the engraver, including Peeblesshire, with parts of Lanark
and Selkirk.      On application    to the Ordnance Survey, however, it
was found that though          all the six-inch maps of the county of
Peebles had been some        time published, and an outline map on the
one-inch scale was also engraved, the one-inch shaded map, on which
the geological     information is inserted, would not be ready for       two
years.    Tljis large  area, therefore, remains unpublished,    and cannot
make its appearance until the one-inch shaded map is completed.
    It  had been     earnestly   desired  that the surveys    of the great
central   coal-fields  should first be prosecuted, but the delay in the

                       of Edinburgh,       Session 1864-65.                         357
completion       of the Ordnance maps made it at last necessary to stop
altogether      the examination of the midland counties.                    The geo
logical survey        was then,     in the autumn of 1863, transferred                to
Ayrshire, of which the county Ordnance                 map is published.           Con
siderable progress has been made there, and                 it is intended to work
northward from the Silurian boundary, so as to complete the survey
of the    Ayrshire coal-fields with       as much     speed as the nature of the
work     will permit.*
    The staff of the Geological Survey in Scotland has always been
very small.        For the first seven years, there were only two geolo
gists,    their labours being aided by          a  yearly visit from Professor
Ramsay,       and by the occasional      personal     assistance of the palaeon
tologist.      One of them,       Mr Howell, whose experience, especially
in the details      of coal-field surveying,     was   of essential service, then
left, and three surveyors were successively              appointed.       Some time,
however,       had necessarily to elapse before they were able to carry
on    independent work.          This they    are   now doing;        and as, in the
south-west of Scotland,          the Ordnance maps have all been published,
it is believed that the Geological Survey               will now       be enabled to
advance      with greater comfort and        speed,  f
    Notwithstanding the hindrances which have impeded progress
hitherto, a considerable area of the country has been examined.
The state of the survey at the end of last year was as follows                   : —
                                                                     Square Miles.
           Area published on the one- inch scale,                 .        963
           Area engraving on the one-inch scale,                  .       382
           Area surveyed but not engraved,                .       .      1169
                                  Total area surveyed,            .      2514
   * It is right   to state that the above   remarks are not intended to impute
any blame to the way in which the Ordnance Survey has been conducted, but
simply to explain why the Geological Survey has hitherto been able to do so
little in the great coal-fields.
   t   From what has been       said above  relative to the state of the Ordnance
Survey,    it will be seen that though the staff of geologists has been small, it
has been quite large enough for the number of maps             available for geological
purposes.      The geologists have    been  all along treading closely     on the heels
of the Ordnance      surveyors, and, to have increased the staff, would soon have
brought the Geological Survey to a stand.          What has been needed has not
been more geologists, but more maps.

358               Proceedings    of the Royal Society
    Besides the one-inch maps, however,        there have been      published
detailed maps on the scale of six inches to a mile of the          coal-fields
of Edinburgh, Haddington, and part of Fife, and it is           intended      to
continue the series through the other coal-basins.          Horizontal      sec
tions, on the same large scale, have likewise been issued             ;   one of
these stretches    from   Edinburgh,    through     Arthur    Seat    and    the
Garlton Hills, to the coast near Dunbar          ; two others cross Mid-
Lothian to the Lammermuir Hills, showing the structure of the
Pentland Hills and of the Edinburgh coal-field.                  Descriptive
memoirs of the neighbourhood         of Edinburgh and of        the East of
Berwickshire have     been published   to illustrate sheets 32 and         34 of
the geological    map, and others of     Fife and East Lothian            are in
preparation.     A  large collection of specimens       of the     rocks     and
fossils of the Lothians, Fife, and the south-west          of Ayrshire has
been made in duplicate, one series being deposited in the Industrial
Museum, Edinburgh, the other in the Museum of the Geological
Survey, London.
    Among the scientific results of the survey, by which          fresh light
has been thrown on the geological        structure of Scotland,       mention
may be made of the discovery of well-marked graptolites (Grapto-
lithus priodon and Diplograpsus      pristis) among the Silurian rocks
of the Lammermuir chain, shewing that these strata are probably
the equivalents of the Llandeilo and Caradoc formations of Wales.
A   considerable  addition has likewise been made to the known                list
of fossils from the lower Silurian limestones and shales of          Peebles
shire, while in Ayrshire, a large suite of shells, trilobites, corals,
and other organic remains, has recently been made from the lower
and upper Silurian rocks, and is now under examination in the
Museum,     Jermyn Street. The discovery of a numerous group of
well-preserved fossils in the shales and mudstones of the Pentland
Hills proved these strata to      be of the   age  of the Ludlow        rocks,   a
position much higher than had before been given to them.
   In the Old Red Sandstone, much interesting work has                      been
accomplished.     It  has been ascertained that this formation in             the
Lowlands of Scotland      is capable of subdivision      into three       zones.
The lowest of these is well    seen between     Tinto and the confines of
Ayrshire. It merges into the upper Silurian shales of Lesma-
hagow, and is covered unconfoimably by all later rocks.                  In the

This      same      lower member of the formation

conglomerate, but  it has yielded fragments
of Pterygotus and plants.*   The Ochil Hills
are formed  of a series of felspathic lava-beds,
with in terst ratifications of sandstone and
volcanic conglomerate,          the whole belonging
to the    Lower Old Red Sandstone.            The struc

stone is seen         in the chain of the Pentland
Hills, where it consists of a mass of coarse
conglomerate and grit, overlaid with a great
thickuess of felspathic         lava-form      and ashy
rocks.         It   lies on the worn      edges of the
Upper Silurian and of the red-coloured strata,
which are supposed to indicate the bottom
of the Lower Old Red Sandstone.                No fossils

    far into Berwickshire, and south-westwards                             into the      uplands     of
    Lanark.          Traces       of contemporaneous volcanoes at the top of the
    Old Red Sandstone have been found near Dunse, in Berwickshire,*
    and near Dunsyre in Lanarkshire.
         The mapping out of the various subdivisions of the Carboniferous
    rocks has opened up some curious                       questions regarding the ancient
    physical geography of the country, and unequal oscillations of level
    during the Carboniferous period.                           It has likewise shown that,
    during the earlier half of that period, the basin of the Forth was
    dotted over with little volcanic cones, which sometimes threw up
    each its mound of ash or current of lava, and sometimes coalesced
    to form long hanks of volcanic ejections, over which the limestones
    and coals were slowly elaborated.                       The subdivisions of this forma
    tion adopted by the Survey in the districts yet examined are —

   The subdivision of the Boulder-clay into two zones was decided
upon in the autumn of 1863, and since then the division has been
carried   out wherever     practicable.     The upper Boulder-clay is             a
looser,  more gravelly deposit than        the lower, and seems         to have
suffered a greater denudation.        It has usually a more or less obscure
stratification, contains a considerable admixture of travelled stones,
with occasional fragmentary shells, and is regarded as having been
formed    in the  sea, a short way off the land,       by bergs from       a  dis-
of the Upper  Old Bed Sandstone. The hills to the south-west of the town of
Ayr are formed of felstones and ashy conglomerates, which appear to belong
to some part of the Old Bed Sandstone period.       They are at present under
iovestigation by the Geological Survoy.

   their loads of mud, earth, and stones to the bottom.                       The   lower
   Boulder-clay or till, on the other hand, seems to have                       gathered
   partly on the land, and partly under the ice-sheet which pushed
  its way out to sea.* This took place when the land was under
  going     a submergence,           so that     the lower Boulder-clay might          be
  accumulating       on the land and along the coast-line, while the upper
  part of the deposit was being formed from the droppings of floating
  ice some        way further out at sea.              The following tables give the

   The list  of stones from the lower clay shews with clearness the
easterly movement          of the ice.     The most abundant         are from rocks
that occur    in situ immediately             to the west, and the further re
moved the    parent mass, the smaller and rarer               are the fragments     of
it in the clay.        It  is to be noted that all the stones are derived
from rocks    that occur in the district           ;  even those which have come
furthest need not have travelled more than eight or ten miles.                     In
the railway    cutting, this lower clay had its upper limit marked off
by a band       of large boulders,           chiefly of greenstone, sometimes
measuring a yard across, and occasionally well striated.                   The rock
of Coretorphine Hill was well represented among these boulders,
and there were      likewise blocks of porphyritic felstone and encrinite
limestone.      Above the line of boulders lay an extensive deposit of
gravel and sand,        which, eastward, nearer the Man Trap, gave place
to an upper sandy clay, in which the stones were found to he more
rounded than in the lower clay, comparatively seldom striated, and
to bear   evidence       of having come from longer distances.               In the
list above given, it will be seen that more than three-fifths of these
stones come, like those in the till below, from the carboniferous
rocks  of the basin of the Forth           ;   that sixteen per cent, have tra
velled  across that basin from the chain of the Ochils, a distance of
at  least five-and-twenty miles,           while     a still smaller number, nine
per cent., has been carried from             the flanks of the Highland moun
tains not less than          five-and-forty miles away.           Where the upper
 and under clays came together            in the section, the band of boulders
 had  disappeared, and the two deposits had no very marked line of
 demarcation between.
    Although     the sands and gravels             of the Kame series have      been

  364                 Proceedings     of the Royal    Society
  traced and mapped by the Survey over a considerable                 area, their
  origin is    still involved in great uncertainty.          In  the uplands of
  Peeblesshire,     beautiful glacier moraines have       been   found, shewing
 the existence       in these high grounds of a group of valley-glaciers
 after the re-elevation of the land.*          Others, on a still larger scale,
 occur among the high grounds of the south-west of Ayrshire.
     In  the course of the explorations of the Survey, proofs             of vast
 denudation      have everywhere      been met with, leading to the con
 clusion that the present inequalities of the surface — our             hills and
 valleys, plains and river-gorges,        are not directly due to upheaval
 and subsidence,        or to fractures of the earth's      crust, but must be
 attributed    mainly to the unequal wearing away of the rocks by the
 sea,  rain, springs, streams, and glacier-ice.
     This address was illustrated by an exhibition of all the published
 maps, sections,       and memoirs     made by the Geological Survey in
 Scotland,     by   a large  map,    on the scale of one inch to a mile,
 shewing all the work which has been doue, both published and
 unpublished, and by enlarged sections to explain the structure of
 the Ochil and Pentland         Hills.f

On a New Bituminous Substance, imported under the name
            of Coal from Brazil. By T. C. Archer, Esq.
     This material was brought from Brazil to Liverpool, for the pur
pose of ascertaining its commercial value in this country.                   The
importers submitted it to Dr Edwards, who reported that it yields
 a much larger       percentage  of oil than even the celebrated coal of
 Torbane     Hill.
     The crude oil of the first distillation has a      sp. gr. of -859.
     On redistillation, a light and heavy oil are obtained             from the
crude oil.
    • They havo been carefully examined by Dr Young, who has given an
account of them in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society for 1864.
    t It is not usual to publish the results of the Geological Survey until they
appear in the authorised and official form.       In the present instance, I am
indebted to the courtesy of the director-general, Sir Roderick I. Murchison
who at once most cordially gave his sanction to the publication of the above
abstract in the Proceedings of the Society.

    The substance itself resembles, in general appearance, dried clay                 ;
but    it  is very   light, being extremely buoyant in water. It breaks
with a      conchoidal fracture, and in some portions there are bands of
minute       striae,   indicating sedimentary deposition.             Thin sections,
which'      I  have prepared with difficulty, show no trace of organic
structure      under the miscroscope.
    No information was received with it                   as   to the exact locality
whence       it was obtained, but in the Exhibition of 1862 similar sub
stances were shown              in the Brazilian collection, under the following
titles    :—
   1.   Schistos      betuminosos        calcareos — from the S'erra de Araripe,
m the       Province of Ceara.

    4.   Schisto betuminoso — from the Morro do Taio, Province of
Santa      Catherina.
    5.   Schisto betuminoso — from Camaragfbe, Province of Alagoas.
    In all probability the specimen before this Society is from one of
these      localities     ;  and the fact that      it is   so  widely distributed in
Brazil      will stimulate further inquiry about            so valuable   a substance.

I. Experimental             Inquiry into the Laws of Conduction of
    Heat in Bars. Part II. — On the Conductivity of 'Wrought
    Iron, deduced from the Experiments of 1851. By Prin
   cipal    Forbes.
   This is a sequel to a paper read 28th          April 1862 (See " Proceed
ings,"    vol.  iv. p. 607), and contains the results of the complete
reduction     of the observations on the conductivity of iron, by the
application      of tha method        there described.    The thermometric
readings are       now rigorously corrected for scale errors, and for the
difference     of temperature between the bulb and the stem.
    The   methods of reduction, consisting of a combination of calcu
lation and     graphical projection, are the same as have been described
 in the first   part of the paper. But the whole has beeen executed
 with   minute attention        to accuracy,   and the avoidance of error of
 every   kind.
    Three cases are       distinguished in the experiments and reductions,
 each  complete      in itself.
    In  Case    I.  a  wrought-iron bar, fully     8 feet  long and 1\ inch
 •qnare,   heated at one end, bad its temperature        observed at different
  points.    The surface was moderately polished.
     vol  v.                                                       3 o

 370                  Proceedings       of the Royal        Society
    In   Case   II.  the same bar was employed in a similar way, except
 that the surface was covered with paper, by which the superficial
 radiation was greatly increased.
    In Case     III.   an iron bar, one inch square, was used.                 The    iron
 was   from a different        manufactory.         The surface was moderately
polished.
    The two first      cases correspond to those worked out              in the former
paper. (" Transactions," vol. xxiii. p. 145.
                                                            "  Proceedings," vol. iv.
p. 609.)      The results obtained in the present paper, after all cor
rections     are    applied,    differ  but    slightly     from    those    previously
given.     The conductivities deduced from the two first                cases coincide
with one another remarkably well, although the data are perfectly
distinct. In Case III., that of the thin bar, the numerical values
of the conductivity          are   considerably     smaller     than in the former
instances, which is attributed          to the different        quality of the iron.
In all   the cases the conductivity diminishes as the temperature                       in
creases,   and diminishes more rapidly in the lower part of the scale
of temperature.          The following numbers will           be found     (for Cases I.
and   II.)  to be nearly identical at 0° and 150° with those previously
published     from less accurate data        : —

2.  On the Chemical Composition of the Waters of the
   Beauly, Inverness, and Moray Firths.                          By Dr Stevenson
   Macadam.
   These     three firths denote different           parts of an arm of the            sea
which has two constrictions ; — one between Craigton Point                            and
Longman Point, and the other between Fort George and                                   the

                      of Edinburgh,      Session 1864-65.                371
  Chanonry Point.        The upper part is known       as the  Beauly Firth,
 the intermediate      portion  as the  Inverness Firth, and the outer part
 as the    Moray Firth.      Two rivers discharge their contents into this
 arm of the sea     ; the Beauly River, which flows in at the head of
 the Beauly     Firth, and the River Ness, which joins at the head of
the   Inverness Firth.       The waters of those rivers are comparatively
free   from saline matter,       as  during the dry season of the summer
of 1863 the water        of the Ness contained only 2-48 grains of saline
matter     dissolved    in the imperial gallon, and the water of the
Beauly     only yielded 3'76 grains of saline matter. Besides these
sources of fresh water, there are numerous burns which convey
water, the composition of which is not essentially different from
that   of the Rivers Ness and Beauly.
   Whilst the fresh water flows in at the upper parts, there is          sea
water    rolling in and out at the lower part during every flood and
ebb-tide, and in quantity sufficient to give rise to tides of the
average     height of eleven feet at certain parts, as at the narrowed
channel     connecting the Firths of Beauly and Inverness.
   The special      object of inquiry was to learn the influence      of the
fresh   water upon the salt water, and the examination was restricted
to the    determination of three points : —
   1st,   The specific gravity or density of the water,         as compared
with   distilled water, taken as 1000- at 60° Fahr.
   2d,   The total amount of saline matter dissolved in 1000 parts of
the   water collected at different stations     ;  and
   3<2,   The proportion of chlorine present in the various samples of
water.
   The principal compound of chlorine present in sea water is the
chloride    of sodium (common salt), and there are smaller proportions
of chloride     of magnesium and chloride of potassium ; but, in an
inquiry as to the relative saltness of samples of water from the
Bame locality, it is sufficient to determine the amount of chlorine,
 and the    calculation of chlorine into chloride of sodium affords the
 most   convenient method of recognising the relative amount of fresh
 water   which has commingled        with the  sea water.
    The samples of water employed in these investigations         were gene
 rally collected from a depth      of three feet from the surface, but other
 samples    were  taken from the surface, and from a depth of six feet.

  372                 Proceedings      of the Royal     Society
     In reviewing        the results   of the determination        of the   specific
   gravities of the samples of water, it was observed that the fresh
   water supplied by the Ness and Beauly Rivers possesses the mean
   specific gravity of 1000'44      ; and the strongest sea water — viz., that
  of Burghead — shows a specific gravity of 1025-13.                    The   many
  samples of water collected from the Firth of Inverness have a specific
  gravity which is considerably beyond the mean of fresh and salt
  water, and     in the majority of instances           closely   approaches the
  specific gravity of the sea water taken          off Burghead,      and which is
  undoubtedly      sea.
     The results of the determination           of the respective amounts         of
  saline matter dissolved in the various          waters entirely corroborates
  the conclusions       arrived   at from the consideration        of the  specific
  gravities, — viz.,    that each sample of water, as collected from the
  Firth of Inverness, is decidedly more salt than fresh, and in               most
  instances the water is practically the strength            of sea water.     The
  lowest proportion        of saline matter in the water of the Firth             of
  Inverness is nearly eight hundred times the quantity found in                 the
  water of the River Ness.
     The relative amount of chloride of sodium,              as indicated   by the
 proportion     of chlorine in the waters from the Rivers Ness                 and
 Beauly, is     so  minute that it only amounts to about half a grain
 of chloride of sodium in the imperial gallon ; whilst the lowest pro
 portion of chloride of sodium (calculated           from the chlorine) which
 is present in the water of the Firth           of Inverness is equal to 1574
 grains in the imperial gallon.
     The water, therefore, obtained          from any part of the Firth of
 Inverness,    contains more than two thousand             times the quantity of
 chloride    of sodium, in a given volume or weight, than that which
 is present in the waters of the Ness and Beauly. In this vast
increase in the proportional          amount    of common salt, there is       the
strongest     corroboration      of the greater prevalence of salt water in
the   Firth of Inverness ; and, judging alike from the specific gravity,
the total amount of saline matter dissolved               in the water,   and the
large proportion        of common salt, there can be no doubt that             the
Firth of Inverness is          sea, and that   it will be found by naturalists
to afford to marine        flora and fauna all the required         strength and
chemical     properties      so essential  for the unimpaired growth,          de-

3.  On Hemiopsy, or           Half Vision.       By Sir David Brewster,
                                 K.H., F.K.S.
   After describing the phenomena of hemiopsy,             as observed by     Dr
Wollaston,    M. Arago, and Mr Tyrrell, the author remarked that no
attempt was made by these writers to ascertain                the optical con
dition of the eye when        it is said to be half blind, or to determine
the  locality and immediate        cause of the complaint.         Having ex
perienced   several attacks      of hemiopsy,     unaccompanied       with any
affections  of the head or stomach, the author found that there was
no  insensibility to light, but merely an insensibility to the lines
and shades of the object which disappeared.                This , insensibility
commenced      in both   eyes, a  little to the left of the foramen    centrale,
and extended     itself irregularly to the margin of the retina on the
left side.    The parts of an object, or the letters of a word which
disappear,   are as  bright   as the ground    around them,       and are white
if the ground is white, and always        of the colour of the ground, so
that the light of the ground has irradiated into the dark lines or
shades of the picture on the retina, a phenomenon which can be
produced   in a sound eye by oblique vision.* This species of irra
diation, however, is merely a local and temporary paralysis of the
retina by the continued action of light upon the same part of it ;
but in hemiopsy, the      irradiation is produced by the pressure of the
blood-vessels,   which may arise from various causes, — from the mere
fatigue  of the eye after long reading or exposure to bright light,
or from affections of the head or stomach.             That this pressure of
the blood-vessels     was the cause of the hemiopsy            studied  by the
author, was proved by      his going accidentally into a dark room while
under its influence, when he was surprised to observe that all the
parts of the retina which were affected were slightly luminous— an
effect invariably produced by pressure upon that membrane.

 4.    On the Tertiary Coals of New Zealand.              By W. Lauder
      Lindsay, M.D., F.L.S., Honorary           Fellow of the Philo
     sophical Institute of Canterbury, New Zealand.
     In  1861-62 the author visited and examined several of the Ter
 tiary coal-measures of New Zealand       ; and the paper, of which this
 is an abstract, contains,  or consists of, an epitome of his observa
 tions thereon.    The collections of specimens made during his excur
 sions, with relative maps and other illustrations, were exhibited        to
 the Society at their Conversazione    of 25th February 1863.      A  suite
 of coal specimens was submitted to chemical analysis by Professor
 Murray Thomson, the results of which are included in the paper.
     The Tertiary coals of  Otago are described  : as being typical or  re
 presentative of those of the other New Zealand provinces.           Their
 characters or qualities are contrasted with those of the

    I.  Topography   and Extent. — Tertiary coal deposits occur      more
or less abundantly in       most   of the    New    Zealand   provinces    ;
especially, however, in Otago, Nelson, Canterbury,        and Auckland.
Occasionally    they form belts extending for great distances, some
times as much as fifty to one hundred        miles,   along sea-coasts or
river banks.     More generally, they are localised in isolated or cir
cumscribed inland basins.       Usually they occupy plains or valleys at
low elevations.    Sometimes, however, they are to be found at heights
of several hundred, or   even thousand, feet on the flanks    of hills.

   II.   Origin of the Coal. — In different localities, and under differ
 ent circumstances, it has at one time, apparently, consisted of drift
wood and     leaves  ; of peat bog, marsh, littoral or forest vegetation
submerged     in situ and subsequently re-elevated        ;  or of marine vege
tation (kelp) subsequently      elevated.    It  has been found mainly in
ancient lakes, estuaries, bays, fjords, coasts, or seas.          Its associated
strata present     frequently, if not usually, alternations of marine
(shell and kelp beds) with terrestrial deposits (dicotyledonous                leaf
or fern beds) ; indicating the occurrence of repeated and irregular
oscillations of the relative      levels of land and water during their
deposition.
   III.   Stratigraphical Relations. — The best class of coals is refer
able to  the Lower or older group of the Tertiary system ; belonging,
however, to different    ages  in this group.
   Lignites, jet, and fossilised    wood  occur also in all the newer or
superjacent Tertiaries, as well as the post-tertiary strata         ;  while drift
wood   and submerged forests may be seen in process of fossilisation
at the  present day.
   Not unfrequently the coal-beds rest immediately on the funda
mental rock of the country, which is usually metamorphic slate,
(probably of Silurian age), though sometimes granite.
   The coal strata are frequently disturbed by eruptive               or intrusive
 Trappean   rocks of Newer Tertiary age, which sometimes              tilt them up
 vertically, or throw them completely        over.     They    are pierced    like
 wise by Trap-dykes,     and characterised      by faults or dislocations        re
 sembling— save, perhaps,       as to the scale on       which they occur, —
 those of our own Palaeozoic coal-measures.           These Traps sometimes
 coke or   cinder the immediately adjacent coal ; more frequently,
 perhaps,  the lithological character of the latter is unaffected.
    IV. Associated Strata —
            a. Conglomerates     (locally known       as    "gravels"      or "ce
               ments"), usually coarse and quartzose            ;  frequently of
               a plum-pudding stone character       ;  generally ferruginous        ;
               passing into
            6.  Orits, which again graduate into         sandstones.       Some of
               the latter are sufficiently hard and pure to be useful

                 building         stones.    Occasionally           they are carbonaceous;       or
                 they       are      impregnated,          or intermixed, with          magnetic
                 iron.
           c.    Clays, frequently arenaceous or carbonaceous, or both                               ;
                 sometimes            ferruginous      ;   occasionally      white and        pure.
                 They include every variety of kaolin, plastic or                          potter's,
                 pipe, fire, and brick clays                   ;   and ochres or ferruginous
                 earths     ;   many of which are suitable for utilisation in the
                 industrial arts.
           iI.    Shales, also generally arenaceous or carbonaceous, or
                 both   ;    sometimes         richly fossiliferous,         containing       espe
                 cially     leaves       (of exogenous trees and fems) beautifully
                 preserved.
  The coal-beds          are      frequently directly overlaid or roofed by Newer
or upper        Tertiary strata;             consisting usually of various                 conglo
merates or gravels, sands and clays.
  V. Contained Minerals —
        a.      Various Fossil Resins, similar to those which occur                               in
                the brown            coals of Germany.               To the settlers they        are
                generically known              as   Kauri          gum, and are      considered
                identical with the fossil resin                so called   in the North Island
                — which         is   generally regarded            as the produce   of the exist
                ing Dammara australis Lambert (N. 0. Coniferce).                              They
                include Retinite and Ozokerite.
        b.      Iron Pyrites (including Marcasite)                      ;   Sulphate    of   Iron;
                Clay Ironstone nodules.
        c.      Sulphur, generally              impregnating sands or sandstones;
                clays or mudstones.
        d.      Quartz, as an impurity.
        e.      Jet;    and vegetable débris in the form of Mineral Charcoal.
  VI.  Lithological or Physical Characters. —Hand-specimens exhibit
all gradations between Lignite, Brown Coal, Pitch Coal, Cannel or
Parrot, and Common British Domestic, Coal. Their texture, fracture,
and lustre consequently vary extremely.                             Generally they     are earthy
and massive     ;   occasionally            laminated  splinter readily on exposure

  VII.           Chemical Constitution.            — The following, which is the mean
(in round numhers)                 of numerous analyses, by various chemists, of the
Tertiary coals of different parts of the New Zealand Islands, may be

  VIII.            Commercial            Value. — Tho following are defects in most,                     if
not    all, of the Tertiary coals of New Zealand : —
  a.       Proportion of water or moisture                        they contain          :    frequently
                20 to 30 per cent.
  I. Comparatively large amount of                         ash.
  c.       Comparatively large amount     of sulphur (in pyrites), giving
            rise to a disagreeable odour during combustion.
  d.       Occasional presence of lime, which gives the quality of
                fusibility.
                                                     " small " on exposure or desiccation.
  e.       Tendency to fall to dust or
      f.   Burn well only when associated with some more inflammable
            '
                fuel, such as wood, peat, or Palaeozoic coal.
  Nevertheless,               in   the absence,     or with a mixture, offuel of a superior
kind, this class              of coal       is,   or may be, used as        domestic fuel,
                                                                                  a

378                         Proceedings           of the Eoyal       Society
as    well   as    in various branches of local manufacture, such                               as brick
and pottery            making,       and metallurgic processes.                   Its     use    is,   and
is    likely to continue,             strictly local.         At present        it   is   employed      as
a    domestic       fuel, mostly        on the gold-fields,          where       it   abounds, and
where fuel of          a    better class     is   scarce,   if   at all to be had         ;   or, inter
mixed with better fuel, by the poorer classes                             in large towns.               It
cannot           compote,        either as   a     domestic,      steam, or other fuel, with
New South Wales or British coals (Palaeozoic), which uniformly
command   higher price, and occupy
                   a                   superior position, in all a
the New Zealand markets.
      In all      the large towns of New Zealand, especially in Dunedin,
Christchurch, Nelson, and Auckland, there                            is   now    a   comparatively
good supply of both local and foreign coals.                              The market prices of
the former vary according as they are delivered                                 at the pit-mouth
or in the towns             ;   and those of the latter as they are delivered                           in
the towns, or from the ships' sides in harbours or roadsteads.
      The market            prices of New Zealand                 Tertiary coals vary from
7s.    6d. to 35s. — average,         10s. to 15s. — per ton, delivered at the pit;
and 40s. to 50s.            — average, 45s. — delivered in towns. Those of New
castle (New South Wales), or Newcastle (English) coal, range from
40s. to 80s. per ton, according as they are delivered from the ship
or in town.
      IX.    Produce        of  the Collieries.    — As yet labour         is   limited and        dear,
and machinery               defective   ;    so that        the highest yield at present                is
100 to 150 tons per week (Fairfield Colliery, about six miles south
ward of Dunedin, Otago)    the average elsewhere being 50 to 100
                                        ;
tons.
      X. Flora          the
                       of        Coal Measures. — Consists chiefly of the wood                         and
leaves      of   exogenous       trees, probably in great measure coniferous                     ;     and
of ferns.           The leaves include               those of species of the                  following
genera —    :
             Fagus,                                  I
                                                                  Myrtifolium,
           Loranthophyllum,                  Phyllitis.
                                                     \
      The general Tertiary flora comprises —
        a. The wood of various conifers, perhaps including the Kauri
             pine, which still exists, though within    limited area,       a                           in

                      of Edinburgh,         Session 1864-65.                    379
             the North Island; and of other exogenous trees: — frequently
             silicified like the fossil wood of Antigua.
      b.  The    leaves   of various exogenous trees of the orders appa
            rently of Lauraceoe and         Cycadacece (genera    allied to Laurus
            and Zatnid) — frequently, like thewood, beautifully silicified
             and preserved ; of endogenous trees, chiefly of the family
            Palmacece ; and of arborescent or large-fronded ferns.
   Most of the fossil plants of the New Zealand Tertiaries are ap
parently extinct species        ;  but, as in the parallel case of the fauna, a
few may be referable to           living forms.
   XI. Fauna of the         Coal Measures. — Mostly marine, including           —
      a. Cetacece     ; bones.
      b. Fish of the shark family (teeth)          : genera Lamna, Carcharias,
              Oxyrhina.
      c.  Echinoderms : Brissus, Schizaster, Hemipatagus.
      d.  Mollusca      :  species of the following genera      : —
              Ostrea,                              Turbo,
             Pecten,                               Crassatella,
              Terebratula,                         Dentalium,
              Natica,                              Struthiolaria,
              Voluta,                              Scalaria,
              Purpura,                              Waldheimia.
              Trochita,
    The general Tertiary Fauna includes in addition                 : —
              Cardium,                              Cyrena        1   f h     t
              Cucull&a,                             Melania       J
              Mytilus,
 While the major portion are extinct species, some are identical with
 existing  forms.
    XII.    Fossilisation of       Vegetation at the present day. — Instances are
 given   of Tree Beds at various depths below the soil, and at various
 elevations      on the mountains : of the fossilisation of drift-wood,
 leaves and seeds      in swamp clays: of the submergence of Kauri or other
  wests  —  that are being, or have been, converted into Lignite on the
 western    coasts (which          are undergoing a process of subsidence)          :

 and of the overwhelming of existing forests by sea-sand on the
eastern coasts   (which exhibit phenomena of elevation).
   Within an area of a few hundred yards on the Greenisland              coast
of Otago, the sand-dunes may be seen encroaching                on the forest,
which consists mainly of gigantic conifers : of other          exogenous trees
of the natural orders —
            Myrtacece,                              Violarieos,

           Magnoliacem,                             Corneal :
of palm-like     and shrubby      Liliacece ; and of arborescent       Fens :
while they    are also  covering in marshes and lagoons, whose           vege
tation consists chiefly of littoral Grasses and Cyperacece : fresh-water
aquatics ; salt-marsh plants : and marine Algaj.

  1. On the    World as a Dynamical and Immaterial World.
                   By Robert S. Wyld, Edinburgh.
   What is matter     ?  has been the question of philosophy from tho
earliest times.     The author of this paper referred to the specula

 382                Proceedings    of the Royal     Society
tions of Thales and other philosophers           of the Ionic    school  six
hundred years before Christ, and to the more profound              views of
the Eleatic school, which had its origin about fifty years later, and
the questioning which then arose regarding the reality of the know
ledge given us by the senses.
   Hume, by ingenious arguments, endeavoured to throw distrust on
all human knowledge, and to show that we could neither prove the
existence   of power, the connection of cause and effect, nor the
existence of an external world.        Kant, roused by this, undertook
to prove that the mind had certain judgments and beliefs, irrespec
tive of those derived from our connection with the world.           This  set
the German      thinkers upon an exhaustive        examination of    mental
phenomena, and led to the idealism         so prevalent    in German phi
losophy.
   Disregarding, however, the extreme views of           a numerous class
of idealists,   the question   still remains open before      us,  What     is
matter  ?
   The phenomena met with in prosecuting             chemical  science    are
frequently    so marvellous  and unexpected as to raise in the mind oi
an abstract thinker doubts as to the theory that the atoms with
which he is dealing      are  material   atoms.     The idea of   matter   or
substance  implies to every man who considers it abstractly the pos
session of certain qualities inherent in each substance.      This idea is
found, however, to be the reverse of a true one.          The most trifling
difference in the proportions     in which   substances are  combined fre
quently creates the most entire change of property.           Witness the
results of the various combinations of oxygen with carbon, with
hydrogen, or with nitrogen, and witness the still more surprising ani
mal and vegetable      productions which result from the united com
bination of these four elements — the oils, the gums, the dies, the
flesh, the vegetables, the medicines, the poisons, — in fact, nearly
the entire catalogue     of animal and vegetable products and prin
ciples with which we    are acquainted. Quinine is composed of seventy
atoms of these four elements, and so is strychnine, the only differ
ence being that the poison has two atoms more of carbon, and two
less of hydrogen, than the tonic.        All  such facts indicate that the
ultimate elements and their combinations         act dynamically, for they
do not act according to the way we would expect substances to            act.

                      of Edinburgh,        Session 1864-65.                      383
 Consider the atoms as matter, and            all seems contradiction   ;  consider
 them as forces, and the phenomena,               we observe, become compara
tively easy to understand           or to conceive.
    For example, the tissues of the animal frame are                  a nicely-ba
lanced     combination of elementary atoms.            All animal   and vegetable
tissues are composed          of clusters or groups of these atoms, and the
nature      of the grouping implies, as the organic chemist well knows,
that these forces         are held in comparatively          feeble combination.
What is flesh to-day is corruption to-morrow,               resolving itself into
new combinations.            This is an essential condition, and without it
nutrition, assimilation, and renovation              would not   be possible   ;  for
it is only where all is feebly held together that          a ready transfer  of the
parts can be effected.          If,  then, we regard our bodies, and the sub
stances we take        into the stomach,        as  nicely balanced collocations
of forces, we can understand              how one group may nourish us, or
become incorporated           with our bodies, while another slightly dif
ferent     combination may dissolve or break up the forces binding the
substance of the animal tissues together, or may stifle or may
stimulate tho movements of the nervous energy, or may completely
paralyse the organ where this vital agent is generated.
    The following seven considerations             and facts, derived from phy
sical science,       lead    us to the      conclusion    that matter     does    not
exist    : —
    1st,    All  matter  (if  such an entity exists) acts external to itself.
The sun acts on the earth, and the earth acts on the moon.                       The
power       of attraction between these large bodies, considered                 as a
mechanical force, is enormous            ; and as we know     of no material link
between       them which can explain so strange a fact, we are com
pelled to believe       in the existence of this tremendous mechanical or
 physical force without a mechanical              agent to produce it.
    2d,    It  is evident, in like manner, that when chemical atoms act
on each other,       they act external to themselves.         It is therefore here
 not  matter which acts on matter, but force on force.
    3<i,   It  can be proved that no one portion of matter ever touches
 another.        The elasticity of all substances proves this ; and when it
 is objected to this argument that the ultimate parts of matter may
 be  compressible, this objection is merely equivalent             to saying that
 (heir parts may come closer, and that they are not absolutely                close.

In   gases the intervals between the atoms must be enormous, and yet,
if the      old theory of repulsion holds, the atoms still repel one another,
even under the nearly                   fully exhausted receiver of an air-pump.
     4th,    A     ray of light falling on a polished surface of coloured glass,
or on a mahogany table, &c., is reflected without acquiring any of
the colour of the body reflecting                       it     This proves that the action     in
reflection is external to the substance of the glass, and that the ray
never touches the reflecting surface.
   The fact with regard                 to   light, that the angle of reflection is        equal
to the angle of incidence, and that there is no dispersion                         of the    ray,
owing to the necessary roughness             of all artificially polished sur
faces,       is,   as    Sir John Herschel observes, in his article on light
(Ency. Metr.),            a   proof that the ray never touches the surface, but                   is
reflected at        a    certain distance from it.
   5th, The passage of the refracted ray after has passed through      it
the band of force (where         bent down towards the glass), and
                                             it   is
comes upon the partially rough                          substance of the glass, affords           a
strong proof that             it   does not encounter            matter there to obstruct or
scatter      it,   for   it   meets the surface at every conceivable               angle, and
yet the different parts of the ray pass through all the inequalities,
preserving  their direction parallel with one another.    We must
therefore regard the surface of the glass as merely the first line of
centres of the atomic forces which constitute                           the substance of tho
glass, and which centres terminate                            again in the line of the lower
surface of the glass.
  Gth,      The free vibration of the ether in the densest bodies,                         such
as the diamond,               ruby, glass, water, and crystals,             and the parallel
direction of the luminiferous ray,                      is   not reconcilable with the theory
of transparent bodies being solid and natural bodies.
  7th,      Our inability to interrupt the attracting action of the magnet
by the intervention of numerous                              plates of non-magnetic       dense
bodies, such as glass, copper, lead, pasteboard, &c., either singly or
in combination,               affords   a    strong      presumption     that all these     sub
stances interposed              are composed not of solid matter, but of com
binations of immaterial forces.
  It   is    evident from the above facts and considerations                         that we
never touch matter (even      exists). And that we never see
                                         if   it                                             it
admitted alike by physiologists and metaphysicians, for vision                            is is

  merely a mental               affection,      called up by an impulse                  on the optic
  nerve made     by the movements of the luminiferous ether, which, not
  the    chair or table, but the forces existing and acting external to
 the chair or table,                 or other object,       radiates       off.     Moreover,          it is
 universally admitted that vision is only a mental affection, not cor
 responding            to anything external to the mind.
        Chemical atoms may therefore                     be regarded         as circles            of force
 without         any nucleus           or core of matter          in them     ;   for    if   the forces
 are the         efficient     parts, there is evidently no necessity to assume
 that an        inert and useless part will exist within them.                                The law of
 Parsimony entirely justifies us in assuming this, and in discharging
 matter from            the atom.
        The universe in this light becomes a vast and glorious exhibition of
       acting and displayed according to those laws which have been
 •pouter,
 impressed, and which laws and system we designate the laws of nature.
     Sir      John Leslie, in his Dissertation prefixed to the " Encyclo
 paedia        Britannica,"          seems to have no              disfavour to Boscowich's
 "Theory of Dynamics," except that the material points                                            are made
 mathematical points, and suggests that, in order to get over this
                      we may conceive              the material       centres       " to have real
prejudice,
dimensions,            though     far    smaller than any assigned measure."
     Professor          Forbes,        in his Dissertation, expresses                a    difficulty in
reconciling        this theory to the law of inertia.  This is probably a
chief      difficulty felt by most men, to conceive of inertia being pos
sessed        by immaterial bodies.                 But the difficulty is entirely imagi
nary, and             arises    from our habit of considering that                            matter has
inertia, and           conceiving that therefore nothing but matter can have
it.      It    is    evident we cannot declare what properties                          are incompa
tible      with immaterial forces.                 Our proof that we must admit them
to have         inertia   is   this.     Let us suppose a molecule of forces at rest                     ;
it   evidently         will not move         unless force   is   applied
                                                                       ;    a     certain amount of
force    is    required to give        it   a certain velocity.     If this be admitted,              then
     follows that         if   the molecule be increased 10, 100, or 1000 times
in it
        mass,   it    must necessarily require 10, 100, or 1000 times that force
to produce            the like velocity.           So far, then, as we have analogy and
 argument            to guide us, these immaterial bodies must have inertia,
 at least      the mouth        is   shut against declaring that they cannot have it.
     If  a     difficulty still remains            in conceiving immaterial masses                      to
        vol.    v.                                                                            3   B

386                 Proceedings        oj   the   Royal Society
possess   inertia or the feeling of ponderosity or immobility, the
difficulty should vanish when it is kept in mind that all our percep
tions of force are only relative, not absolute.             If    our living bodies,
then,     and the substance      of all external        objects, are of the     game
immaterial nature,         we should   not be surprised, but should rather
expect, that the inertia of external objects should appear in propor
tion to their    masses,    and that   it should also have        a relation to the
strength as well as the mass of our percipient bodies, all being com
posed of the same immaterial           substance.
  The great difficulty felt by those metaphysicians who believe in
matter has always been regarding this inert thing, matter. Take
away, say they, the qualities of colour, heat and cold, resistance or
solidity, from any object, and an inert something remains to puzzle
us.   The author, on the contrary, holds that resistance or solidity
constitutes matter.  The difficulty felt by metaphysicians is thus
avoided — namely, the necessity of conceiving a thing to exist with
out qualities.
  There is another difficulty which besets the believer in matter.
The human mind has always felt a difficulty — an apparent incon
gruity, almost approaching to a feeling of impossibility —when it
conceives of a Being, whose essence is spiritual, creating a thing of
a different   essence     from Himself, which matter is conceived to be.
The ancient philosophers    of Greece, feeling this, declared that mat
ter was   uncreated, and eternal.   Spinosa, one of the acutest minds,
felt also the    difficulty, and in his Ethics he lays it down as an
                 same
axiom of reason that " the knowledge of an effect (the world, for
instance) depends on the knowledge of the cause, and things that
have nothing in common with each other (matter and spirit) cannot
be understood by means of each other."  Hence the one cannot be
the cause of the other.          'We state this principally to show how
extensively the difficulty has been felt of conceiving the existence
of two different essences in nature.
  Recent discoveries have established that heat is mechanical force,
the two being mutually convertible                without loss.     The attraction
of gravity and chemical attractions and repulsions are all the same
physical forco, and the entire external world is nothing but a
manifestation of    it, — simple and grand conception, and one which
                           a
enters the domain alike of physics, of speculative                philosophy,   and

  of theology, and which in all of these sciences is equally important.
  It  represents   the external world and its Creator as possessed         of one
  immaterial and spiritual essence       —power and intelligence being the
  attributes   of the Creator, and power subordinate and sustained             the
  characteristic   of the creation.
     The objection to a system of pure dynamics        will probably     be this.
 It will   be said forces cannot exist except as the properties of matter.
 The belief in the necessity of matter is all but universal.                 This
 arises, we   think, from    a law  of the mind, which when it reflects on
 anything as existing immediately,         and of necessity, assigns     a  cause
 for its existence.       The generality are satisfied to regard the pro
perties perceived      as constituting the  thing or object.    The object is
 thus a hard     or soft, a black or white, or coloured thing. The man
of science applies his mind to the consideration            of the properties,
and afterwards to the consideration        of the thing itself, as if they   were
 different entities, and he thus assigns matter         as the cause       of the
properties    he observes.      The author also believes in    a cause   for the
forces   of which he has spoken ; but as he has not matter to fall
back on, he      is compelled to assign as the cause that Being who is
the centre       of all power and wisdom, and who manifests these
attributes to his creatures in the vast and complex arrangements of
a  dynamical universe.
    The tendency of speculative         philosophy has been to run into
idealism.        This has been its fate in Germany, and it is to be
feared    it may come to the same conclusion             in Scotland.        The
author    would deeply deplore such an end to our boasted Scottish
philosophy.        The ultimate foundation of all reality has been ad
mitted    by nearly every philosopher to       be the Supreme      Being. If,
then, the theory propounded should assist abler hands in establish
ing realism directly on this foundation, the author would feel in no
ordinary degree gratified and rewarded.

    tcardsia     ; and the Polyps of Alcyonium digitatum. By
    W. C. M'Intosh, M.D., F.L.S.                Communicated by Pro
    fessor   Allman.       (Accompanied by various Drawings.)
   The Nudibranchs owe their prominence in British zoology to the

388                Proceedings     of  the Royal Society
lute   Dr Johnston of Berwick, and to the splendid monograph of
Messrs Alder and Hancock.
    Inhabitants for the most part of the laminarian and littoral
zones, the rocks and rock-pools, by minute and continued search,
produced the greater number of those met with at St Andrews, the
few others being procured from fishing-boats          and debris of storms.
Almost      all require   to be sought      for with care, and generally
escape superficial notice altogether.           Most have been kept for a
longer or shorter period in confinement, and some are living
 even now, though        with greatly diminished bodies, and less bril
 liant tints, the results of insufficient food and other unfavourable
 circumstances.
     Their favourite haunts    are under     stones in pools, and the more
undisturbed      these look, the better chance is there of securing fine
 specimens.      The upturned surface of the stone, however, should
be   immersed an inch or two under the clear water, so as to float out
the branches of the zoophytes and the branchiae of the Eolids.          The
 fjndness of the smaller forms for surfaces covered with Sertularidas
 is also seen in the case of storms, where the richest        fields are the
 broad blades of the Laminarias that are covered with Laomedea geni
 culate and gclatinosa.
     The species met with at St Andrews will be given in the order
 in which they occur in the "Monograph" above-mentioned, with
 such remarks appended to each as may seem necessary or new.
     The most plentiful Nudibranch here, as elsewhere, is Doris tu-
 berculata, which occurs in all sorts of places amongst the rocks at
 low water.     In   storms, many are found on the west sands in the
 intricate hollows of large     masses    of Halichondria panicea, a situa
 tion   affording   them both food and shelter.        Some, found     under
 large stones in pools, were unusually flattened         and rounded, like
 gigantic Lamellariae      : such   are  not gaily tinted.     Most of   the
 specimens, especially those of large size, had some of the parasites
 described    by Alder and Hancock under the name of Ergasilus,
 which sported over their branchiae and other organs with wonderful
agility. Messrs Alder and Hancock state that they are colourless,
but in most cases these had a pure white cross on the back, and
some were pinkish.          The largest Doris measured fully 4| inches.
 Their food, as usual, is Halichondria panicea.

    Doris Johnstoni     is somewhat scarce, and generally in company
with the former       under stones between tide-marks.              This species
does not    sport in tint.    It is an active animal in confinement.         The
same species     of Ergasilus occurs on this Doris            as on the former.
Largest specimen,       2J  inches.
    Boris repanda is one very commonly found at all seasons amongst
the rocks. The largest specimens are often of a dusky yellow tint.
Many had the border of the cloak injured, as             if  a portion had been
eaten   out.    It is very tenacious of life in captivity.          Two kept for
some    time in a vessel along with a little Corallina officinalis de
posited their ova ; and this being one of the few species that
Messrs    Alder   and  Hancock had not observed at the breeding season,
nor yet   succeeded in obtaining its spawn, a more detailed account
will be given.
    On the 10th     of November,      the two were observed         in coitu, and
apparently in a state of excitement,          elevating    the cloak all round
the margin in a       curiously frilled manner.         They lie head to tail,
but   not very closely, and the intromittent organ is capable of great
extension and distension, so that the animals             are enabled to effect
their purpose, even when one is lying at right angles to the head
of the other.       On the 12th they were both in process of depositing
their spawn on the side of the glass.               The coil is a simple one,
attached by the edge, and sloped upwards and inwards.                   The eggs
are   very large and conspicuous.
    In spawning, the body is shortened            ;  the posterior edge of the
cloak    being doubled       inwards, so as to press on the outer edge of
the coil of ova.       The upper (left) edge of the cloak is raised from
 the surface    and arched in a graceful manner.            The anterior border
 is spread out and flattened on the surface          of the glass, and the fore
 part of the foot      is likewise   similarly fixed.      In   the ceutre of the
coil of spawn, the foot was bent upon itself, causing a deep dimple,
 and this   hollow remained although the animal changed its position.
 As the act    of deposition proceeded, it glided the anterior (attached)
 extremity upwards,        while the posterior (free) turned downwards,
 thus  favouring the gradual exit of the coil.              The anterior part of
 both foot and mantle constituted         a broad   pivot on which the animal
  revolved   from right to left.       The posterior border of the mantle
  did not always remain         alone at the outer part of the coil, for by

 390               Proceedings    of the  Itoyal Society
 and by the posterior     part of the foot likewise projected, and          the
 dimple in the centre became less marked, though still         present.
    Next day it had nearly completed two coils, and then,            having
 diverged at an angle, left an interrupted row of ova in single file.
    So far as observed, their stomachs contained only cells and gra
 nules.
    Doris aspera. — Under stones in pools near low-water mark            ;  not
 uncommon.
    Doris bilamellata.  — Abundant all     the year round    ; occurring in
swarms     in March, and, according      to  Dr John Reid, in February
 also.  They manifest a tendency to congregato together in a vessel,
 and often crawl out of the water.       Their stomachs contain a grey
 ish-brown mass of granules.
    Doris pilosa. — Common ; of all hues, and occasionally party-
 coloured.     The same peculiar granular matter existed in the
 stomachs of this species, but with the addition of a greater number
 of larger granules and cell-like bodies      ; there was also a tendency
 to form bolus masses.
    Of Doris subquadrata, only    a single specimen occurred.
    Goniodoris   nodosa   is a very  common      species, first found      here
by the lato Rev.     Dr Fleming, and afterwards by Dr John               Reid.
 There is little to     be   met  with at St Andrews in support of
the statement of the able authors of the " Monograph" — in regard
to the disappearance     of the adult animal      and the growth of          the
young   ;  for the varying sizes occur throughout the entire             year,
fine full-grown specimens (1£ inch) being found in December as
well as in March, April, and May. They are hardy in confine
ment.
    Triopa claviger occurs now and then under stones, in situations
seldom invaded by aught but the waves.            The most striking        fact
in connection     with this animal is the occurrence, in two out of
three specimens, of crustacean parasites (Ergasili) similar in all
respects    to those   found   on the two first-mentioned species             of
Doris.
    One of the most remarkable       amongst the Nudibranchs, and at
the same time       comparatively rare, is met with in considerable
abundance, viz.,    JEgirus punctilucens.      Belying its generic     name,
it frequents the under surfaces of stones in pools, from low            water

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1864-G5.                        391
 to above      half tide mark, apparently delighting in dark surfaces
 whose    tints closely resemble its own. They were met with several
 times in groups.             JE. punctilucens lives well in captivity, and it
 spawns in July.
    Polycera quadrilineala was first found at St Andrews by                  Dr John
Reid in the         month        of September.       It   is occasionally   got after
October      storms,       and at low-water      mark during the same season.
They also spawn at that time.
   Polycera ocellata is gregarious amongst these rocks                  ; very active
in confinement         ;    apparently    phytivorous.       Spawns in September,
and sometimes the ova are deposited on the surface                    of the water in
an  incomplete       coil.
   One     young specimen of Polycera Lessonii occurred after                 an Oc
tober storm on a           laminarian blade covered with         L. gcniculata.
   Ancula cristata is rather             a common       Nudibranch, living under
stones   in quiet pools between tide marks, sometimes in groups of
three.      The majority of the specimens are pale. They spawned
in August.
   Trtionia Hombergii comes occasionally from the deep-sea fishing.
In the stomach of one, about                    inches long, were fragments of
the usual      food (Alcyonium digitatuni),            mixed with darker debris,
possibly     from Amphitrite tubes.
   Tritonia plebeia, very abundant                 on Alcyonium digitatuni (on
which     it  probably feeds), cast on shore by storms, on corallines
from deep-sea fishing,             and procured      by the dredge off the lami
narian     zone.     Twice were full-grown             specimens got in autumn,
having a remarkable             process on the left side, about the last bran
chial appendage          ;  indeed, the tail seemed bifid.
   Dendronotus arborcscens            generally   comes     from deep water in the
fishing-boats, or from débris of storms.                   Dr John Reid first pro
cured   it at St Andrews.            None were ever heard to emit the sounds
 mentioned      by him and        Dr Grant.
   Doto     fragilis. — Specimens          occur   on    corallines  from   deep-sea
fishing.      They   are rarer than the succeeding species, and            generally
larger.
    Doto coronata. — Abundant             in the    same    regions  as tho former
 and  also under        stones in rock pools.          One showed a curious       ab
 normality in the left dorsal tentacle.

 392               Proceedings      of  the  Royal Society
   Eolis papilhsa occurs very plentifully during some years amongst
the rocks, but is absent from its accustomed           haunts during others,
without apparent     cause.
   Supplying the place of the large E. Drummondi of the west              coast,
is the more beautiful and graceful Eolis coronata, which is                occa
sionally met with near low-water mark.             They sometimes       devour
portions of their own tails.
   Eolis rufibranchialis appears amongst the rocks, and in debris              of
storms.    The wbite granular streak down the tail is interrupted             by
pale papillae.     They   are agile   and restless in confinement,      and do
not scruple to devour a dead companion of any species.
   Eolis olivacea is met with sparingly under large stones in               rock
pools, between tide marks.         It is hardy.
   One of the most plentiful species is        E. viridis, a group   of six    or
seven occasionally     occurring under a stone, and smaller numbers
more frequently.       Of all the Eolides observed, this has the most
prehensile   tail.   It is easily kept for many months,       though    it loses
its tints.
   Eolis Andreapolis, n.      s. — Body half an inch long, ovate-oblong,
of  a pale-yellow or dull purplish hue, the latter chiefly marked              at
the sides  ; with the dorsum faintly granular, and brilliantly blotched
over with large, elongated, bright orange-pink spots, which were
quite absent from the tail.        Some of these spots were in front of
the dorsal tentacles— one at the anterior and outer aspect of each,
and a very distinct mass at their junction.         There are   a few smaller
orange spots at tho sides below the            branchiae.-  Dorsal    tentacles
about twice as long as the oral, not much tapered, approximating
at the base  ;  tips pale amber, then      a broad belt of reddish   orange      ;
a few white     grains   at  either end of the orange.         Oral tentacles
short and blunt, capable of a spoon-like flattening ; similarly tinted.
Branchia; elliptical or club-shaped, purple, pale at the base, and
densest in colour next the reddish-orange           cap at the tip.     In   one
pale specimen, a waved central           vessel was apparent.      There     ap
peared to be more than a dozen transverse rows.            The structure       of
the tongue approached        most nearly to      E. tricolor.    Found     after
storms, and at low water amongst the rocks.
   Eolis Farrani. — At low water amongst            the rocks,    and on the
beach after storms.      Not uncommon.

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1864-65.                           393
    Eolii exiqua. — A number were found on Laomedea              geniculata upon
  Laminarian blades, cast on shore by an October storm.
    Eolis Robertiance, n.    s. — Body three-tenths    of an inch long, rather
 stout, and   of a prevailing orange-red hue ; granular, with a few
 paler  spots. Dorsal tentacles extremely attenuated, long, linear,
 smooth, orange-red.         Eyes very distinct, set in    a pale   yellow space
at the base    of the tentacle posteriorly.      Oral tentacles shorter,   linear,
similarly attenuated,      orange red, and proceeding from the angles of
the lip.     Bronchice    thick, rather swollen,       elongated, tipped      with
Jeep orange-red,       which likewise     passes   down the sides      ; the base
paler orange.       They were incomplete       in the specimen, but appeared
to be set    in nine or ten transverse rows, leaving             a considerable
space   in the centre.       The first row comes nearly       as  far forward   as
the dorsal tentacles.        Foot orange yellow, rather suddenly tapering
to a short tail.    Jaws of a pale straw colour ; lingual plates somewhat
like those of E. tricolor, and stouter than in E. Farrani.                  Froni
the  border   of the laminarian zone during         a spring tide.
               Note on the Polyps     of Alcyonium digitatum.
   The varied descriptions        and figures of these common polyps pro
bably arise    from the changes which          so readily ensue on removing
them    from    their native     sites in the usual      manner.      The figure
given by    Ellis,* though not accurate, shows            a closer   approach to
the natural     aspect of the tentacles       than Dr Johnston's,f        and the
same    may be said of    Muller's.J Dr Johnston is correct enough in
his description,      so far as it relates to faded and sickly specimens
brought from deep water by the fishermen.                Sir  J.  G. Dalyell§ is
somewhat more exact         in his description of the tentacula and gene
ral appearance,       but his figure does not represent the polyps in
perfection.
   The most perfect        specimens     are got amongst the rocks at low
water, under     stones in pools.       Small patches can       be chipped off,
adhering to a fragment of stone, without            injury ; and taking one
of these,   three-fourths of an inch in diameter, it is found that the

 thickness of the film in contraction           is not more than one-tenth of
 an inch.    As the polyp contracts into its stellate aperture, its mouth
 gapes, apparently the more readily to give exit to the water in its
 interior.    It  presents the aspect of an octagon with hollow             sides
 when about the level of its cell.          Rows of spicula project from the
 corners towards the centre.
    If further   extended, the tentacula, their pinnae, and the rows of
spicula    become more apparent         ;  oral aperture   dilated  ; outline of
oral disc similarly octagonal, though much larger.
    When still further extended, a coiling of the arms is frequently
seen, like the circinate vernation of the ferns.
    In  a state  of full expansion, the polyp is elongated and narrowed
towards the head, measuring more than half an inch from the tips
of the tentacula      to the base.        The tentacles can     be stretched to
more than twice        the diameter       of the oral disc, are narrow        and
tapering, and have the elongated pinnae at each side             ; the tips    are
slightly    opaque,   probably    from      minute suckers.      The   tentacles
are also roughened       by minute spicula, which do not, however,              go
further than the      base, where a pale, unspiculated         portion   occurs   ;
below this the neck of the polyp is supplied                with long spicula
with tuberculated edges, arranged in an arrow-shaped manner.                    In
those polyps which are best expanded, the diameter of the                    oral
disc is smallest.     Sometimes,      from the position of the parts, the
tentaculum     with its  pinnae presents a spindle-shaped        appearance.
           Note on tuxj New Species        of the Oenvs Edwardsia.
   Edwardsia Allmanni, n.        s. — Found on       the beach at St Andrews
after an October storm.        This actinia inhabits      a very apparent fret
tube.     The tentacles can     be retracted, and the       external border     of
the disc pouted over them.          The disc is marked by eight alcyonian
divisions or radii, and has always a ragged border of the investing
sac.    The colour of the disc is pale brown or dark flesh tint.
   Tentacles simple, rather blunt, pale and translucent, with a white
streak in the centre.       The rim of the mouth occasionally         protruded
as a conical process.

  various kinds      ;  and   it gradually increased in density from the
 growth of its      constituent structures, and probably from the shed
 ding of mucus.
    The presence of the case distinguishes it from Feachia and                  Hal-
 campa ;    from the former       it is also separated by the fact of the ten
 tacles  being wholly retractile within the swollen               disc.    It  seems
most    nearly allied to Edwardsia, though the            case was     much larger
than    any previously mentioned,           and its tentacles were also blunter
and    shorter.
   Edwardsia        Ooodsiri,    n. s. — Found with the foregoing;            sheath
less   perfect.     It   constantly protruded      a pale bladdery     portion with
minute suckers posteriorly,          and was more lively and sensitive than
the former.         When      fully contracted, it assumed the shape of             a
Roman     jar, and measured less than £th of an inch in length.
   Tentacles fifteen, translucent, longer than the diameter of the
oral disc,    and not tapering much.            At  the tip of each, under a low
power is seen a        slightly opaque whitish ring ; then the tentacle is
perfectly    transparent for a short distance.           From the base, a white
spear-head       reaches     more than half-way up, its centre,            however,
showing the transparent           texture.
   Oral   disc     streaked     with white and light brown           ;  mouth     not
observed to project.          Column behind the tentacles pale.
   When fully extended,           it measures about half       an  inch, the pos
terior pellucid portion forming nearly the half of this. The anterior
part of the latter, however, is tinged of a light fawn colour from
the viscera.
    3.  Miscellaneous Observations               on the Blood.         By John
                Davy, M.D., F.R.SS. Lond. & Edin. &c.
    These observations are given in six sections.
    In  the   firet,
                       " On the Action of Water on the Red Corpuscles of
the   Blood,"     the results    are stated    of trials of different proportions
of water on these corpuscles           ; from which it would appear, that two
of water to one         of cruor of the blood of the common fowl, sufficed
to  change the form of the corpuscles, and to render them globular.
Other changes are described, which were witnessed when water in
great   excess was used, — changes            referred by the author      to endos

 396               Proceedings of the Royal Society
 mosis and exosmosis, and rupture of the corpuscles, and the exclu
 sion of their nuclei.
     In the second, " On the Changes         which take place in the        Blood
 when excluded from air,"       it is shown that these changes         are much
 the same as when blood is exposed to the air, the difference                  be
 ing chiefly in degree as to time, the accordance, it is                inferred,
 owing to the presence of oxygen in the blood itself, the                retained
 oxygen being sufficient to originate putrefactive           decomposition.
     Iu the third, " On the Action of the Air-pump on the Blood,"                it
 is stated by the author that the results obtained were more various
 than he could have expected.           Some of them were the following :—
 Of the several animals of which the blood was tried (the common
 fowl, the duck, sheep, bullock, pig), least air was procured from that
 of the common fowl ; more from the blood of animals killed after
 feeding than after fasting    ;  more from venous than arterial blood             ;
 none from serum of the blood          ; this last result confirmatory      of the
 inference that the air — the extricable air— is chiefly derived from
 the red corpuscles, &c.
    In the fourth, " On the Effects of           a   Low Temperature on the
 Blood," results are described showing that the freezing of the blood
does not preserve it from change of composition, ammonia having
been found evolved from      it when frozen        ;  and that evolution    of the
volatile alkali takes place from stable dung when frozen, and from
some other manures ; but that muscle (meat) in its frozen state does
not appear to be liable to the same change.
    In the fifth, " On the Action of Ammonia on the Blood,"                     an
account    is given  of the effects of different          proportions    of  aqua
ammoniae     on the entire  blood, and on its fibrin, its serum, and red
corpuscle.     The results obtained were such as to confirm the infer
ence that the coagulation     of the blood is nowise owing to          escape of
the volatile alkali, a very large proportion          of ammonia not prevent
ing coagulation.
    In the sixth, " On the Coagulation of the Blood," some remarks             are
offered on one of the latest hypotheses brought forward to account
for the phenomenon,       the hypothesis        of Professor    Lister tending
to show that that hypothesis        is not sufficiently founded on fact, and
concluding with the expression of belief, that the fern causa of the
change is still to be discovered.

  The following Communications were read : —
 1. On the      Pronunciation of Greek.                  By Professor Blackie.
  I.    On the revival of learning at the middle of the fifteenth                      cen
tury, the Hellenists of Europe took the pronunciation                          of    Greek
from their teachers, the learned Greek refugees who fled from Con
stantinople     when that city was taken by the Turks in 1453,                         and
who carried       with them the Greek               language,    both as the living
people who used       it,   and as the inheritors of the rich store of philo
logical learning accumulated               by   an unbroken     succession of Alex
andrian, Roman, and Byzantine scholars.
  II.    This Greek     pronunciation            of Greek remained        undisturbed
among European scholars till Erasmus, in the year 1528,                        published
an essay on Greek pronunciation,                 at Basle, to prove that the By
zantine Greeks       had in this matter departed in many points from
the practice of their ancestors.   The effect of this essay was not to
reconstruct the lost pronunciation of classical Greek upon any
scientific basis, but merely to unsettle the minds of men, and to set
every European       people upon the task of inventing               a   pronunciation
of Greek according to their own conceit, and after the model gene
rally of their own national peculiarities. The consequence of this
unreasoning      procedure has been that Babel of confusion                  which     now
reigns with regard to the pronunciation                 of that noble language,              of

                            of Edinburgh,           Session 1864-65.                          399
 which the          living Greeks with           so much reason complain,            and which,
 in my       opinion, it is the duty of philologers,                as   it now is    to a large
 extent in        their power, to remove.
      III.      In this haphazard creation of                 a modern      pronunciation      of
 Greek       according to individual               conceit all nations fared         ill, but the
 English by far the worst                 for they flung the whole basketful of
                                          ;
 their     phonic anomalies           into the Greek grammar, and produced a
jargon as        like Greek     as   French would
                                              by a Cockney who
                                                             be spoken
had never shown himself beyond the sound of the Bow Bells in
Cheapside. The Scotch, partly by following the analogy of their
own musical       Doric dialect — partly from old habits of familiar inter
course       with Continental scholars not under English influence —
contrived to preserve a pronunciation of Greek                           as    far   as possible
removed        from the barbarous innovations of their English neigh
bours,       and conformable in some most important respects to the
acknowledged practice of the Greeks in the classical periods.
   IV. Specially it can be proved by a very distinct passage in
Dionysius of Halicarnassus — a rhetorician by profession in the age
of Augustus Cassar (ntpl owOto-tw oVopcnw, ch. XIV.)— that the
whole series         of the vowels a            c t o v   is pronounced by the Scotch, as
by all the     Continental nations, correctly, with the single exception
of    v,   which in some parts of Scotland is confounded with oo, and
not    according to the perfect analogy supplied by the native words
guid,      bluid,    as these words are pronounced                by the best speakers of
the    Scottish dialect, corresponding                    to the sound of   ii in German,      as
in Buhne,         Briider, &c.       It       is also certain that the pronunciation of
the    diphthong       ov   practised         by the English      is contrary alike to the
whole      traditions of philology and to the most marked characteristic
of the Greek language.                All       scholars recognise oo as the only legi
timate pronunciation of that most musical of the diphthongs.
   V. About the pronunciation of the other diphthongs in the strictly
classical — that  the Athenian — period, great doubt prevails
                        is,                                       but                     ;
there      is   good evidence        to show that at was pronounced                    like the
same       diphthong in the English word vain, and « like this diphthong
in the English       word receive, at Alexandria in the time of Calli-
machus,         about two hundred               years before Christ.          Any attempt to
reconstruct the         Attic orthoepy of the diphthongs on the principle
suggested         by Erasmus, of showing how they                 ought to be pronounced

400                       Proceedings of the Royal Society
by the most obvious and easy interflow of their vocal elements,                                      can.
according to the experience of all languages, issue in no reliable                                      re
sult.     Pronunciation is           a matter   of usage, not of argument.
    VI. What  is called the modern Greek pronunciation, or that
used by the Greeks speaking their own language at the present
day, is not modern in our sense of that word — it is Byzantine and
Alexandrian      ;    and in its most characteristic                  elements as old             as the
oldest Greek         manuscripts          now existing — as old, we may                       say more
correctly,     as the general         body of the ante-Nicene theology.                              That
it is    a corruption                          pronunciation is self-
                              from the oldest classical
evident, from the fact of its giving the slender sound of i to half a
dozen different vowels and diphthongs.                          But this is only what                may
be saidwith equal truth of French, English, and other languages,
which have passed through various stages of culture during succes
sive centuries.      Their present pronunciation     in many important is,
points,   a   corruption of that which was originally the rule.
    VII. In    these circumstances, the practical question                             is   not without
difficulty how far the Byzantine Greek                           pronunciation should                    be
acknowledged          by those        nations    who, like the Scotch,                        have     the
happiness to use          a    pronunciation of the vowels and diphthongs,                              on
the whole exhibiting             a   pretty fair approximation to what                           can    be
certainly known about the true pronunciation of Greek in the
palmy days of Attic eloquence. It  certain, for instance —or at
                                                      is
least extremely likely, for the modern Greeks show sturdy fight                                         on
this point — that the Scottish pronunciation of                              rj, as   a   prolonged      e,
like the long English a in              mate,   is   classical, while the English                      and
Byzantine pronunciation              of that vowel         as   a    long i    is     fundamentally
false.     Nevertheless,       I   lean to the opinion recently announced                                by
the French Academy,               that the Byzantine pronunciation, notwith
standing some obvious                defects, should            be    accepted as            a   general
basis for the         pronunciation         of the vowels and diphthongs                           by   all
European      scholars     ;    and that for these four reasons                 : — (1.) It       is   not
a   modern     innovation, but         a   historical fact of nearly two                      thousand
years' duration in its main points, and must be known to the student
of early manuscripts,            as the    only true key to           a   whole class of blun
ders made by the early transcribers.                       (2.) Though            a    corruption       in
some points,     it   is   a   characteristic    corruption, and, in fact, only the
development          of   a    marked      national tendency —      tendency well
                                                                              a

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1864-65.                                    401
known to      Quintilian,        as   is evident from the contrast drawn by him
between       Latin and Greek in the words              :   — Qwamquam iis            major    est
gracMtas,                             (3.) If adopted, it would form
               nos tamen sumus fortiores.
a   uniform basis of mutual understanding between all persons, whe
ther scholars or native Greeks,                who may use the Greek language                    ;
and no     other uniform basis is at present possible.                (4.)   It   would tend
to keep     up a friendly feeling between professional scholars and the
living Greek people — a feeling by no means a matter of indiffer
ence     either to the peace of Europe, or to the growth of a scientific
philology.
    VIII.     But though         I    willingly follow the French Academicians
in assuming the         Byzantine pronunciation             as the   only sure historical
basis    for the pronunciation of Greek among European                             scholars,    I
claim the liberty of making one or two deviations from that tradi
tional norm in the special case of its application to ancient poetry.
In this region          the mere luxury of sound must always be a legis
lative    element   ;    and as, in reading Chaucer, an English                    scholar of
the present day,         if he   would enjoy the poetical rhythm, necessarily
departs    in some points from the pronunciation suitable for the reci
tation    of Tennyson or even Shakspeare, so, in reading Homer, if
I   depart so far from the Byzantine basis as to pronounce oi with
the   full vocalism heard in our English word joy, rather than with
the attenuated sound             of the modern Greek itacism,           I am only using
what every      intelligent Greek will consider              a most legitimate          liberty
in the circumstances.                 For though   I may     have no means of know
ing how Homer enunoiated his well-known iroXu^Xo&rCoto,                             I am sure
that in the      early stage of            a language       used by such a hardy and
vigorous people as the Greeks the extreme gracilitas of the modern
itacism could not have been                  a dominating characteristic: rather
it seems impossible that the pronunciation of any human language
should     have remained              absolutely   without change for             a period     of
nearly 3000 years.
    IX. But      the sound of the              vowels   and     diphthongs,           however
important, is only one element in the proper pronunciation.                             Accent
and quantity — that     pitch, emphasis, and duration of syllabic
                             is,
sound — are matters of no less consequence, and form  no less sig            a
nificant feature in the physiognomy,                 so to speak,     of each particular
form     of human speech.              With regard to quantity,      I   remark simply
    vol. v.                                                                       3 a

402                Proceeditigs    of the Royal     Society
 that the practice      so  common    among     classical  teachers, both in
 England and Scotland, of allowing short syllables to be pronounced
 long and long short, except in penultimate syllables, is worthy of
 all reprobation  ; nor is there the slightest scientific foundation for
 the practice    recently introduced     into some English academies of
 pronouncing the long vowel,       as in mater, with a decidedly different
 quality from the same vowel when short, as in pater. The long
 vowel is merely a prolongation of the identical sound heard in the
 short vowel, as in job, Job, and many familiar English             examples.
 With regard to accent, it is quite certain that both the English and
 Scottish scholars are altogether wrong ; and that the living practice
of the Greeks in this matter is the only one that harmonises at
once with historical tradition, and with the conclusions of philolo
gical science.     That the classical Greeks pronounced their language
with an exact observance of the accent is a point on which the
ancient   grammarians      are quite decided   :  they all assume that cer
tain determinate       accents are as     much the law of living Greek
utterance generally as certain quantities are the law of rhythmical
composition.      Neither do they leave us in the slightest doubt as        to
what the nature of accent really is.         The name acute o^us given      to
the ruling accent plainly marks an elevation of the pitch of the
voice on a certain     syllable, and the words brlrao-K and ano-is tech
nically applied to the acute and grave accents, meaning tension,
stress, or strain, and relaxation or remission, plainly point out the
element of emphasis, which gives one syllable of a word a marked
preponderance to the ear above the rest.            The whole doctrine      of
enclitics also marks emphasis or stress          as an essential  element of
the Greek accent     ; and the accented verses of the Byzantine popular
poetry and the pronunciation of the modern Greeks all drive us              to
the same conclusion,       which only obstinate prejudice, ignorant con
ceit, or stolid stupidity can resist.       This conclusion is that when
Olympian Pericles thundered against Spartan insolence, and De
mosthenes     against    Macedonian     aggression,    they emphasised the
thunderbolts    of their speech in the same       manner that Greek words
are now emphasised by an orator in the modern Greek Parliament,
or a muleteer on the ridge of the modern Greek Parnassus.
   X. The practice by which the British school of Greek scholars
has hitherto been distinguished, of pronouncing Greek by the laws

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1864-65.                        403
   of Latin accentuation, transmitted to us through the Roman Catholic
   Church, while     at the same time the real Greek          accents are care
   fully marked on every printed page, and taught minutely as a
  matter  of learned indoctrination, is one of the most curious instances
  of combined carelessness and perversity             in the whole history of
  learning.    Had the Greek accents not been marked               so  curiously
 on    every Greek word       in every page of printed Greek for the last
 four centuries, some excuse        might have been found for a practice,
 for which the vis inertice      of human nature and the Latinised habi
 tude   of academic ears      so  powerfully plead    ; but as the matter now
 stands, the persistence       in a perverse practice, refuted    by every fact
 in historical tradition, and every argument in philological science,
 stands as a    staring absurdity alone in the annals of scholastic life.
 The aversion which the English scholars generally have to acknow
 ledging the truth in this matter            appears to me to have its origin
 partly in a gross habit of ear, which renders them unable to appre
 ciate certain    musical and elocutional         distinctions which underlie
 the subject,    partly in   a sort of unreasoning      conservatism, which is
 the backbone     of their whole scholastic and academic system, partly
 also, and     principally,     perhaps,   from   a vague imagination they
entertain that the spoken accent of Greek prose has something to
do with the     rhythmical recitation of Greek verse. Now, it is quite
certain    that, however distinct the accented syllable was in Greek
oratory,   in the composition of Greek verse the duration of the vowel
sounds    was the only element necessarily taken into account, while
the spoken       accent  was either      silent altogether or heard with       a
marked      subordination      to the accent of the rhythm. And, as            a
matter    of educational practice, nothing is more easy for          a boy who
has an ear — and he who has none need never read verse — to pass
from the accented      pronunciation of prose to the quantitative mensu
ration of poetry without confusion.            Even the daily practice of our
schools teaches that a boy cannot read a single distich of Ovid
rhythmically      without putting      a stress on the last    syllable of the
final dissyllable, which is quite contrary to the natural accent of
the same word when pronounced in prose.
    XI. In   conclusion,    I   have to observe that the pronunciation of
all Greek     words    indiscriminately       according   to the   monotonous
Latin accentuation,      is merely a part of an entirely false method of

404                 Proceedings      of the Royal Society
teaching prevalent in the great English schools, according to which
dead rules are substituted        for living functions, and doctrines      about
sounds for the sounds themselves.               Whosoever      as a teacher      of
languages has seized on the great principle that the ear is the special
organ used by nature in acquiring a knowledge of articulate sounds,
will never commit the mistake    of pronouncing e\eos, the divine
attribute of mercy, with the same intonation that marks cXcos, a
wooden block for washing mince-collops. The Greek language con
tains whole columns of such words, which the man who pronounces
Greek according to          Latin accents must pervert and turn into           non
sense.     To teach any language with false accents and false              quan
tities, and yet to inculcate       rules about true accents and true quan
tities, is to declare the schoolmaster wiser than the Creator, and to
insist on doing by a forced and painful process of memory what
nature is willing to do for us by the pleasant habituation            of the   ear.

   The quantity represented by                                in any
                            <U+FFFC>  Jvds, or its equivalent Jv'dt,
case of the motion of a particle, is known to possess important
dynamical      relations.      The accidental     discovery    of   a singularly
simple     geometrical      representation   of this quantity in the      case of
planetary motion led me to inquire whether                the method involved
might not be easily generalized.    This note contains a sketch                  of
some of the results of a hurried investigation of the point.
  Graphical representations of the action in some common cases                   of
motion readily suggest themselves.
   Thus, in the      case    of the parabolic    trajectory   of an unresisted
projectile,   the action through any arc of the path is proportional             to
the area included between that arc, the directrix, and two ordinates
parallel   to the axis; while the time          is,   of course, represented     by
the intercept on the directrix.
  Again, in the      case    of the ordinary brachistochrone        (the cycloid
with its vertex downwards), the action and the time, corresponding
to any arc from the cusp, are         respectively proportional      to the   area
and the arc of the corresponding         segment of the generating circle.
  Numerous      other simple cases might be given, but these are suffi-

cient      to show  that such representations depend mainly upon the
particular      nature of the path, and therefore cannot be included in
any general          formula.      But the example which follows appeared to
point out some such general method                         ;    applicable        at least to central
orbits.
    In     an elliptic orbit described about the focus, the time                         is proportional
to the     sectorial    area described about one focus, and the action                             to    that
about the other.       — The proof of this theorem                    is obvious,     if we remember
that the      product of the perpendiculars,                     from the foci, upon the tan
gent to an       ellipse, is constant.
    This appeared to me to indicate, as a mode of representing                                           the
action in a central           orbit, the seeking for a curve allied to the orbit,
and    in its plane      ;   such that,        if    two tangents            be drawn        to    it,   the
area     intercepted         between them, the curve, and the orbit, shall be
proportional         to the action.           In    the case of the elliptic orbit, above
referred to,       this curve would evidently become                              a   point, viz., the
second      focus.      The following investigation, however, does not give
a   very    encouraging        result   : —
    Taking the centre of force as origin, let x,                            y,   be the co-ordinates
       point in the orbit,                    those of the corresponding                   point in the

and,     consequently,         the lengths of the perpendiculars                            drawn to      it
from the       origin, and from the point                  £,   17,   are
                                                    dy         dx
                                        p=xds-yTs.
and
                               /-(-©J-(»-f)S.
respectively.          That the elementary triangle, whose vertex                                  is   (,   17,
and      whose base      is   &,   may be          proportional to the element of the
action, we must          evidently (as we            see   by referring to the              case   of the
ellipse above) have
                                         pp' = constant.

Also, by the nature of the construction we are attempting, it                        is
obvious that the line joining the points x, y, and (, rj, must be                     a
tangent    to the locus of £,    17.     This gives us at once the             second

Since, by the equation of the central orbit, which is supposed to                   be
known, we have x and y in terms of s, we may take                    s as  indepen

          to   Special Cases of Constraint.                         By Professor Tait.
   Hamilton's beautiful theory of Varying Action reduces to the
discovery of a single function any problem connected with motion
under the action of a conservative system of forces, and with con
straint by any system of smooth fixed surfaces.
     It   does not appear to have been applied                           to cases (such as the
brachistochrone) in which the requisite                             constraint is the thing to
be determined.

5   On the Motion of a Heavy Body along the circumference
                   of a Circle.     By Edward Sang.
   This paper contains a demonstration"of the theorem           given in    the
fourth volume of the proceedings at p. 419.
   The theorem in question was arrived at by' the comparison of the
well-known formula for the time of descent in a circular arc, with
another formula given in the     " Edinburgh Philosophical       Magazine"
for November      1828, by a writer under        the signature     T. W. L.
Each of these series is reached by a long train of transformations,
developments, and integrations,        which require great familiarity
with the most advanced branches of the higher calculus.                Yet   the
theorem which results from their comparison has an                   aspect of
extreme simplicity, and seems as      if it could be reached by       an easier
road.   A   search for this easier road has led to the discovery            of a
few simple propositions,    which contain the whole theory of motion
in a circle, and which only require for their examination a know
ledge of the fundamental law of dynamics, and an acquaintance
with trigonometry.
   There are two distinct     cases  of motion in a circle, viz., one in
which the heavy body describes with a varying velocity the whole
circumference; the other in which the motion is oscillatory, as in
the example of a pendulum.         The first step of the    investigation      is
to establish   a relation  between a continuous        and an      oscillatory
motion, such that their periodic times bear a certain ratio             to each
other.    To these two motions the name conjugate is given. By
means of this relation the problem,
                                            " to
                                                  compute the time of re
volution" in the case of continuous motion, can be converted into
another    problem,
                      " to find the descent in       a  circular    arc,"    and
contrariwise.

    The second step   is   to deduce from     this pair of conjugate motions
 a second  pair of motions       also conjugate    to each other, and   having
 their periodic times   in simple ratios to those of the preceding pair.
   The third step is to form a progression of pairs of conjugate
motions deduced successively one from another.                In this progres
sion, carried   in the direction inverse to that just mentioned, the
motions approach       with extreme       rapidity, on the one hand to a
uniform   circular motion, on the other hand to the oscillation in an
exceedingly    minute arc.
   As  a practical result of the whole,        it is shown that, for all   cases
of clock motions,    and for experiments          to determine the length of
the seconds    pendulum,       the time of oscillation may be held to be
proportional to the square of the secant of the eighth part of the
whole arc described      ;   the number of oscillations per day to be pro
portional   to the square of the cosine of the same eighth part           ;  and
the  daily retardation      to the square of the sine.
   6.  On the     Action of Hydriodic Acid on Mandelic Acid.
                 By Alex. Crum Brown, M.D., D.Sc.
   The relation of mandelic acid to benzoic aldehyd is so precisely
the same as     that of lactic acid to acetic aldehyd, that whatever con
stitution we assume for the latter acid, a similar one must be
ascribed to the former.
   The researches      of Kolbe and Lautemann, and of Wislicenus,
prove   that lactic acid is oxypropionic acid.           Mandelic acid must
therefore be    oxytoluic acid, and, indeed, it has been          so formulated
by   Kolbe in his work on Organic Chemistry.
   While agreeing with Kolbe and Wislicenus,                I  prefer, for some
purposes, to employ formulae          slightly different from those of either
of these chemists.
   Thus, using H as a contraction for        jj'q   j CO, the relation of alde
hyd, chloride     of ethyliden, ethylidenic chlorhydrine, and common
lactic acid, may be expressed by the formulae

    Replacing CH3 in these formulae hy C6H5 we get the              formulae of
the corresponding substances in the aromatic series.
    The complete analogy between lactic and mandelic acids as to
the mode of their formation naturally suggests the idea that their
decompositions        should also be analogous; and yet, considering that
no oxyacid of the aromatic         series had as yet been directly reduced
to the corresponding        normal acid, it seemed to me to be of interest
to examine the reaction of hydriodic acid on mandelic acid, in order
to see whether       it follows the analogy of salicylic or of lactic acid,
and   if the latter, to compare the toluic acid thus produced with the
two isomeric acids at present known.
    For this purpose, mandelic acid was boiled with concentrated
aqueous     hydriodic acid and phosphorus           in  a flask  fitted    to   an
ascending Liebig's condenser, so that the vapours of hydriodic               acid
condensed, and ran back into the flask.           Notwithstanding the        pre
sence of     excess of phosphorus,         the liquid   immediately      became
opaque from the separation of a large quantity of free iodine,                and
the drops of condensed hydriodic acid became milky.              After boiling
for about half an hour, the reaction was complete, and the iodine
was removed by the phosphorus.              The clear liquid, while still hot,
was decanted from the excess of phosphorus, and on cooling solidi
fied to a crystalline magma.          The crystals, when drained         and re-
crystallised once or twice from boiling water, presented the follow
ing properties    : —

 colourless crystals, which dissolve in solutions of the alkalies with
 a  yellow colour.       I am at present engaged in its examination,            and

     A comparison of the properties of the toluic acid thus              prepared

 point of alpha-toluic acid is 76'5, that of the acid from mandelic
 acid is 76°'0    ;  the former boils at 265° 5, the latter at 264°.             All
 the characters of alpha-toluic acid, with the exception of the smell,
  are so exactly the same         as those   of the acid from mandelic         acid,
  that there is not     a  word in Moller and Strecker's description         of  the
  former which does not perfectly apply to the latter.
     The reduction of mandelic            acid to alpha-toluic acid appears        to
  prove, 1st, that, notwithstanding its lower fusing point, the latter
  acid is the true homologue of benzoic acid.f

formic acid    ;  and, 3d, the subtraction of oxygen, we have advanced
one step in the homologous series of the aromatic acids           ;  and, as far
as we can see,      there is nothing to prevent         the repetition   of this
step, and the gradual ascent of the series.
    With   a view to ascertain whether      this is possible,   I have treated
cuminol with hydrocyanic         and hydrochloric acids, and the results
obtained are sufficient to encourage me to continue the investigation.
7. On the Nature of Antozone.                By Alfred R. Catton, B.A.,
    F.R.S.E., Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, and
    Assistant to the Professor of Natural Philosophy in the
    University of Edinburgh.
    Many of the properties of ozone are very similar to those of per
oxide of hydrogen.        Thus ozone, like peroxide of hydrogen, is in
many     cases a powerful    oxidising agent. In other cases, however,
it acts   as a deoxidiser.    Thus ozone deoxidises peroxide of hydro
 gen and peroxide of barium with the production of water and oxide
 of barium.      Peroxide of hydrogen also deoxidises oxide of silver,
 the peroxides of manganese and lead, permanganic and chromic
 acids, &c.      Again, ozone is decomposed catalytically by dry silver
 leaf and by several oxides, such as the peroxides of manganese and
 lead, &c.     Peroxide of hydrogen is also decomposed catalytically by
 several metals — gold, silver, platinum, and metallic oxides.            Ozone
 liberates iodine from a solution of iodide of potassium.           Peroxide of
 hydrogen does the same by the mere addition of a few drops of proto-
 sulphate of iron, the latter undergoing no change during the reaction.
     We  see then that the general properties       of ozone   are very  similar
 to those of peroxide       of hydrogen.      If, however, we examine the
 properties of these compounds in detail, we find that their particular
 properties   are complementary       to each    other.    In other words, for
 the particular compounds for which ozone acts as an oxidising
 agent, peroxide of hydrogen does not act as an oxidising, but in

  414              Proceedings     of the Royal    Society
  general as a reducing     agent.    Thus mercury    and silver    are con
  verted by ozone into oxides.         These  oxides  are reduced to the
  metallic state by peroxide of hydrogen.
     A piece of paper moistened with Eulphate of      manganese is tamed
  brown by ozone, owing to the formation of peroxide of        manganese.
  The peroxide of manganese thus formed is reduced by peroxide                of
  hydrogen to the state of protoxide.         Similarly, by the action        of
  ozone on subacetate of lead paper, peroxide of lead is formed,        which
 is again reduced to protoxide of lead by peroxide of hydrogen.
    Peroxide of barium is produced by the action of peroxide of
  hydrogen on hydrated protoxide of barium.         Peroxide of barium is
  on the contrary reduced by ozone to oxide of barium          ;   the ferro-
 cyanide of potassium is converted by ozone into ferricyanide,          which
 latter is again reduced by peroxide of hydrogen.
    This opposition in the characters of ozone and peroxide of hydro
 gen, indicated by their action on other compounds, is maintained
 in their action on each other.       Though peroxide of hydrogen           and
 ozone are both powerful      oxidising agents, by their action on        each
 othertwoneutral substances     are produced, waterand ordinary oxygen.
 These characters naturally suggest the idea that ozone and          peroxide
 of hydrogen    are  related to each other, much in the same            way as
 acids and bases, which, though both possessed of decided        characters,
 mutually neutralise each other. In other words, that the characters
of ozone and peroxide of hydrogen bear to each other that relation
which is indicated     by the words electro-negative     and electro-posi
tive  ; a conclusion  remarkably   confirmed by the production of ozone
during the electrolysis    of an acid liquid at the positive pole,      and of
peroxide of hydrogen at the negative pole, as shown by Meidinger,
thus showing that ozone is to be regarded          as an electro-negative
compound, and peroxide        of hydrogen    as an  electro-positive      com
pound.     And  as ozone    and peroxide    of hydrogen neutralise         each
other, so to speak, we are led to suppose that they are each           formed
by the combination       of the  same   number   of molecules.        We     are
thus led to assign to ozone the formula OOO (0 = 16) as           suggested
by the equation

                    of Edinburgh,      Session 1864-65.                 415
 The signs placed over the bracket         merely denoting that H200 as
 a whole is to be considered       as an electro-positive   compound, and
 000   as electro-negative.
   This view of the constitution of ozone is due to Professor Odling
(Manual of Chemistry, 1861), and the most important argument
in its favour is the non-diminution in volume of ozonised            oxygen
when the ozone is decomposed by iodide of potassium or mercury
(loc. ext. p. 94).
   The existence      of antozone     has been   fully established by the
experiments of Schonbein        and Meissner.
   The latter has shown that when electric discharges are passed
through      dry oxygen,     another    substance,  antozone,   is produced
besides ozone.      If the  latter  be destroyed   by passing the electrised
oxygen through a       strong solution of iodide of potassium, antozone
remains mixed with ordinary oxygen.
   The properties of antozone can thus be observed. One of the
most characteristic of these is the formation of a thick white mist
when passed into water.           This same white mist is also formed
when the gas produced by the action         of concentrated sulphuric acid
on peroxide of barium is passed into water.             In the latter case,
therefore, antozone is produced, and not ozone (as stated by
Houzeau).
   Now, on examining the characters           of antozone    as far as they
have   hitherto been observed, we find that, instead of being comple
mentary to those of peroxide of hydrogen, as in the case of ozone,
they correspond with them very closely.         In other words, where per
oxide of hydrogen acts as a reducing agent, antozone does so also.
   Thus    a paper moistened   with sulphate of manganese, and coloured
brown by ozone, is again decolorised          by antozone, owing to the
reduction of the peroxide of manganese at first formed to the state
of protoxide.      Peroxide of manganese is also reduced by peroxide
of hydrogen.
   Similarly,   a paper    moistened with.subacetate of lead, and dis
coloured by ozone, is again whitened           by antozone,   owing to the
reduction by the latter of the peroxide of lead first formed to prot
oxide of lead.      Peroxide of lead is also reduced by peroxide of
hydrogen.
   Similarly, dilute acidulated solutions of bichromate and perman

416               Proceedings      of the Royal    Society
ganate of potassium are reduced by antozone.             Peroxide of     hydro
gen also reduces chromic and permanganic           acids and their salts.
   We   are thus   led to regard antozone as a compound              analogous
in constitution to peroxide of hydrogen ; in other words, to regard
antozone as peroxide of hydrogen, in which the hydrogen is
replaced by oxygen, or representing, as before, peroxide of hydrogen
by + (H200), antozone        is  +(000), and ozone -(000).              The    +
and   —  signs being   merely used to denote the idea that one com
pound acts as electro-positive      and the other as electro-negative.
   If we   adopt the hypothesis       that free oxygen      is formed by the
combinations    of two atoms of oxygen (0 = 16), one of which               acts
                     -
as an electro-positive
                 +
                          and the other as an electro-negative            atom,
free oxygen is   0 0.
   Hence, since free oxygen is produced when ozono is decomposed
by mercury, ozone must be either          050     or  0 0 0, in     accordance
with the equations
                Hg, +     000        =  Hg20     +    0 0, or
                   Hg2 +     000      =   Hg20    +   00.
    The latter formula is inadmissible,       because,   as we    have shown,
ozone acts as an electro-negative         compound, which therefore           re
quires that the two outside atoms should both be electro-negative.
For 0 0 0 would neither          be   decidedly
                                                 - -
                                                 electro-negative
                                                     +
                                                                        nor de-
cidedly electro-positive.       Hence ozone is 0 0 0, which is the view
of Professor Odling.
    Sir Benjamin Brodie has shown (Phil. Trans. 1850)                  that the

 reducing properties of peroxide of hydrogen require us to

                                                                      assign to
it the formula       0 0.     Hence antozone is    0 0 0,     a formula which
 indicates that antozone acts as an electro-positive         compound.       Tbe
production of ozone and antozone by the passage of electric              sparks,
 or the silent discharge through dry oxygen, is thus represented              by
the following equation     : —
                Ordinary  Oxygen.             Ozono.      Antozone.
            00     +   00      +  00     =   000       +    00    0.
    These formulae indicate      hypothetical!y why antozone          combines

    Peroxide of hydrogen         cannot,   however, be formed     by the com
bination     of H2  0  and   0 0 0.
   Again,     it gives an explanation of the formation of antozone by
the   action of oil of vitriol on peroxide of barium.             For we may
suppose      the   peroxide of barium        to decompose     in the following

same    time with the formation of antozone : —
                          +  -          +          + -  +
                          00      +     0     =    00   0.
    It must not     be supposed that by the algebraic        signs here used it
is  intended to denote that the atoms of oxygen preserve any abso
 lute electric     state.    Although     in   a compound     oxygen    may act
as   0, we must        guard    against   imagining that      in any chemical
          +
action    0 cannot be transformed even with the greatest facility into
0.    The fact of the production of free oxygen in the action just
 referred to shows that such is the case.           Sulphuric acid is a highly
 electro-negative      compound, and we can easily understand how the
                              +

 how   0 is even changed into 0.
    Again, by the action of heat on peroxide of hydrogen,              it is  de
 composed      into water and ordinary oxygen.         We must here suppose
 that the peroxide      decomposes thus —

     It   might     be supposed, from                 these views of the constitution                     of
ozone and antozone, that when in contact they ought to combine
with each other            to produce         ordinary oxygen.                There       is,   however,
no more reason that this should be the case than that an electro
positive element like hydrogen should combine with oxygen, which
is   electro-negative,       when mixed with each other.                             As in      the case
of hydrogen         and oxygen,            however,        it   is   possible that ozone             and
antozone may combine to form ordinary oxygen                                                              of
                                                                                  by the passage
the electric spark.          The increase in volume of electrised                         oxygen          by
the passage        of the spark from             Ruhmkorff's coil, may possibly
                                                 a                                                        be
partially due to this        cause,       although no doubt owing in great measure
to the decomposition             of   some     of the ozone and antozone                    by    heat.

                       of Edinburgh,         Session 1864-65.                             419
      On the     contrary,    antozone       appears, from the experiments                   of
 Meissner, to be more stable              in the presence of ozone than when
 mixed with      ordinary oxygen.
      The following fact may possibly              be considered      analogous.           An
aqueous     solution of peroxide of hydrogen (an electro-positive com
pound)     is rendered more stable by the addition of an acid, an
electro-negative compound, but less stable by the addition of alkalies.
      Also, since oxygen is essentially              an electro-negative          element,
we can     easily understand why antozone, which we may look upon
as    containing electro-positive         oxygen, gradually decomposes, and is
changed      into ordinary oxygen,           as observed      by Meissner.            And we
can,    on the     contrary, understand         why ozone is a comparatively
stable compound.
      Schönbein has shown that peroxide of hydrogen                    is produced in
many cases      of slow oxidation occurring in the presence of moisture.
This is      commonly attributed to the formation of antozone, which
subsequently combines          with water to form peroxide of hydrogen.
In the author's         view, however, the peroxide of hydrogen is the
immediate        product of the reaction.
      In the oxidation of zinc, for instance,
           +            -+              -+           +    -          +-+
           Zn,     +    0 0     +       0H2    =     Zo,0.       +   OOH2.
      Supposing that this view of the constitution of antozone is con
firmed by    further investigation, it will afford a strong support to
the    theory that the elements in the free state are formed by the
combination of two atoms in opposite electrical states, as well as
of the electrical      theory of chemical affinity.
                            difficulty in the supposition that oxygen
      Some persons find great
can    combine with itself to form compounds differing entirely in
properties     from ordinary oxygen.            There     is,   however, in reality no
greater    difficulty in this supposition than in other admitted cases
where    a compound combines with itself to form other compounds.
Methylene, for instance, when liberated from iodide of methylene
 by            of copper and water, combines with itself to form
      the action
ethylene and tritylene, as shown by M. Boutlerow.    Tritylene, in
fact, bears to ethylene   somewhat similar relation to that which
                                a
ozone    and antozone bear to oxygen.              Again oxygen, in the language
                                                         ,
,of   modern chemistry,        is   a   polyatomic    element    ;   and   it   -is   a   well

420                      Proceedings               of   the   Royal Society
known fact that polyatomic                          compounds hare a great tendency                         to
combine with themselves to produce others of greater complexity.
  There         is,   therefore,      d      priori, nothing improbable in the                      supposi
tion   that oxygen              may, under              proper           conditions,      combine       with
itself; but, on the contrary, the analogies of science are in                                         favour
of such    supposition.

 it presents us with the results of a long experience in feeding adult
 men, so as to preserve them in health and strength.

to the English, French, Prussian, and Austrian armies                                              ;   while the
war diet, in addition                   to these, includes the Eussian, Dutch, Federal
States, and Confederates                       States' armies.            Our own country is                    the
only one which does not possess a special war diet, and the want
of it told in the frightful mortality of the Crimea.  During the
latter part of the Russian war, the rations to the English                                               soldiers
were increased            ;    but the diet of the English                         army when engaged
in the arduous work of war                      is,   according to the author of the paper,
unworthy of the country— twenty years behind the state of science,
and  hundred years behind the experience of other nations.

would represent moderate war work, found                                      it   necessary to eat, Dr
Playfair obtained returns from the garrison at Chatham.    As                                                       is
well known, the Sappers and Miners are men versed in trades with
which       they are occupied when not working at fortifications,                                              or   in
the field.         With the permission                      of Col. Harness,                    Col. Collinson
undertookthis inquiry, and obtained the exact food consumed                                                         by
495 men for twelve consecutive days.    The reduction of these
carefully prepared returns                     is   as follows,      in ounces and tenths of                        an

   It   will    be seen that         this dietary resembles much the war dietary,
except that as                potatoes are largely used in garrison, the starch,
and consequently                the carbon,           is   increased.         The author               concludes
that    a   war diet should have as                   a    minimum        a   supply of          5J    ounces       of
flesh    formers in the food.                       This quantity             is   necessary to enable

2.   Notice of a large Calcareous Stalagmite brought from the
    Island of Bermuda in the year 1819, and now in the
    College     of Edinburgh.       By David Milne Home, Esq., of
    Wedderburn.
   The author stated that this stalagmite was a calcareous deposit of a
columnar shape, which had been brought to Edinburgb, about forty-
six years ago, by his father, the late Admiral Sir David Milne.
   Whilst commander-in-chief on the North American and West
Indian Station during the three years ending 1819, Sir David had
passed a part of every winter in the genial climate of Bermuda.
He took much       interest   in the various objects of natural history
abounding in the island, and particularly in its remarkable caves.
    Possessing some knowledge of geology, and being a personal
friend   of the late Professor Jameson of the University of Edin
burgh, who was then collecting specimens from all quarters for a
Museum,       Sir David resolved,    on  the expiry of his command,        to
bring home with him, besides madrepores and other marine pro
ductions, some of the beautiful calcareous deposits from the caves,
 and present them to the Museum.
    These calcareous deposits consist      — 1st, Of crusts of crystallised
 matter coating the floor, sides, and roof of the caves     ;  2d, Of icicle-
 shaped    formations   attached to and pendant from the roof; 3d, Of
 columnar-looking      deposits resting on the floor, with broad rounded
 tops.
    These various     deposits are formed in the usual way, by water
 highly charged      with lime ; — the lime being held in solution by
 carbonic acid gas contained in the water, and on the escape of that
 gas, as  the water evaporates, the lime is precipitated.
    All  the requisites for these deposits abound in Bermuda.            The
 rocks  of the island (of which a specimen was exhibited) are entirely
 calcareous, being composed of comminuted fragments of sea-shells
 and zoophytes.       The amount of rain which falls annually on the
 island,   and which percolates through the rocks, is very consider

424                         Proceedings           of the Royal    Society
able, — whilst the heat of the climate is great                       ;   and there              are fre
quently strong parching winds, which promote evaporation.
  The different forms of the stalactite deposits are believed                                           to
be formed         in the following manner : — When the water, after                                  per
colating the limestone rock, reaches the roof of the                                  cave,       and in
such quantity             as to drop copiously             and rapidly, the evaporation
takes place, both during the                      falling of the water to the floor of                 the
cave and after it reaches the floor.                         In that case the calcareous
matter accumulates on the floor, and                       if the water continues to drop
long enough from the same part of the roof, the deposit gradually
rises up in a columnar form. These are the Stalagmites.
      If,   however, the water is less abundant, and the drops less fre
quent, evaporation                takes place whilst they are adhering                            to the
roof.        In that      case    the drops of water thicken on the roof itself
into        a calcareous         paste, and icicle-looking          deposits          are        formed.
These are the Stalactites.
  The two forms of deposit were indicated on a sketch exhibited,
and were illustrated by specimens on the table, which Professor
Allman had allowed to    brought over from the College Museum.
                                        be
  Much larger specimens, however, of both kinds, had been brought
to the Museum, —one of these, a stalagmite, about 6 feet high,
now at the door of the Museum.                         Another, to   be more particularly
described, was too ponderous to be placed there                       ;   it had always                lain
in the vestibule of the Mathematical Class-Room.
      Its length      is,                                            11 feet      3    inches.

Supposing that there are 44 cubic feet of stone in this                                stalagmite,
and that          each cubic foot weighs                170 lbs., the weight would                         be
nearly       3J   tons.
 The cave from which this stalagmite was taken         situated                   is                     at
Walsingham, in the parish of Hamilton, aud upon the side of hill,                                  a
about 40 or 50 feet above the sea, and                   a   quarter of   a   mile distant          from
it. The author remembered the cave well, having, with his brother,
been in Bermuda with Sir David Milne during his command.
  The cave inside might be about 25 or 30 feet high at the                                       greatest
height of the roof, about 50 or 6O yards in length, and                                       20 to     30
yards in breadth.                 But   it   is   quite irregular in shape.             It       contains

an      immense number of both stalactites and stalagmites of all sizes.
Some of the          latter had grown up       so   high    as to have reached the                  roof
and become           supports to   it,   and were from 30 to 40 feet in girth.
  At the bottom or lowest part of the cave there            large and            is   a
deep pool of salt water, rising and falling with the tides, — proving
a    connection with the sea.
     The entrance         of this cave        is   narrow,    and       about     8       feet high.
The floor descends           rapidly and irregularly.                   At   the      distance       of
25 or 30      yards from the mouth stood the stalagmite which forms
the     subject of the present notice. At this place the floor slopes
downwards,           and the roof      is   about 15 feet above the floor, so that
the stalagmite           had grown          up high enough          to nearly reach the
roof.
     This stalagmite, the author's father caused to                          be sawn           across
near its       point of attachment           to the floor.         It   was first sawn half
across,      and   a   nick made with the saw on the opposite side                         ;   it   was
then pulled over, so as to cause fracture,                   the column having been
previously secured by strong                  tackling and shears to prevent                         it
falling over altogether.
     The author's brother, Rear-Admiral Sir Alexander Milne, having
been commander-in-chief for the last four years on the North
American Station, he also, as their father had done, spent the
winter at Bermuda,           and when there, paid one or two visits to the
cave      from which the stalagmite                 had    been taken.                He had no
difficulty in recognising the trunk, by the evident appearance of its
having been sawn across            ;   and he was at once struck                   by observing
that    it   was again growing, by the accumulation                     of fresh calcareous
matter.         It   occurred to him that      it   might    be   interesting to measure,
as   exactly as possible, the quantity deposited during the forty-four
yearswhich had elapsed since the stalagmite had been removed.
With that view he made the following observations —                          :
 He noticed five drops of water falling on the trunk, — two at the
rate,    each      of them, of three or four drops in the minute.                               The
other three dropped much less frequently.
     On the      part of the trunk where the two first-mentioned                               drops
were     falling, two small knobs of calcareous matter had been formed.
     On the    part of the trunk where the three last-mentioned                                drops
were     falling, the deposit consisted of only thin crust.  a
     vol. v.                                                                          3    k

426                     Proceedings            of   the    Royal Society
     One    of the knobs              measured           in height above the           fractured
surface five-eighths of an inch, and had at its base an area of
about      3f inches in diameter.                  The other knob measured in height
four-tenths     of      an    inch,   and had at its base an area of about 2\
inches.
     Supposing these knobs to be exact cones, there would be 2-3 cubic
inches in the former, and -53 cubic inches                          in the latter, — making
altogether 2 83 cubic inches.                      But    as the tops were rounded, one-
third should                this result, — making altogether 3 77 cubic
                    be added to
inches.       With regard to the amount of matter deposited by the
three remaining drops,                 it    was    scarcely    appreciable,      so   that the
cubic contents of the whole deposit may be very safely assumed                                  as
not having exceeded five cubic inches.
     Such    having been the                 amount        of growth       of the stalagmite
during forty-four years, it occurred to inquire how long, at the
same rate of growth, it had taken for the whole stalagmite to be
formed.       In    the part of it now at the College, to say nothing of
the contents of the trunk                   still in the cave, there        are 44 cubic feet,
or above 76,000 cubic inches.                       If this amount     of calcareous      matter
had been deposited at the same rate as the 5 cubic inches during
the last forty-four years, the whole stalagmite would have required
the astounding           and incredible period of more than                     600,000 years
for its formation.
     There    are    several circumstances,                however,    deserving     of notice,
which show how little such a calculation is to                        be   relied on, — though
at first sight it is perhaps quite                  as plausible    as many other calcula
tions of a similar kind.
     It   assumes that during the whole time of the formation of the
stalagmite, the calcareous matter had been deposited at exactly the
same rate as during the last half-century    in other words, that the
                                                                ;
supply of calcareous water to this part of the roof had been always
exactly the same. There                      is,
                              however, nothing to prove that this
was the case        ;
                     —   it   is,   moreover, not in the least              likely to   be true.
Indeed, the great probability                      is,   that the supply of water        to any
one spot in the roof would be much greater at first than afterwards.
The porous limestone rock of Bermuda becomes hardened and
encrusted by the rain-water percolating through or over     and                           it,
the rapidity of this process was marvellous.  Lieut. Nelson                                     of

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1864-65.                                     427
the Engineers,*            when he was superintending the excavations                         in
Bermuda     for the dockyard, found the eggs and bones of a sea-fowl,
ODe    of the existing species which lays its eggs in crevices of the
rocks, entombed                in the coarse limestoneThe poor bird,
                                                                rock.
whilst sitting on its nest, had been caught by some storm of sand
which filled up the crevice, and the prisoner, with its eggs, became
petrified        and encased in the rock.                  Many examples of the same
kind had come to Lieut. Nelson's knowledge.                        He found a canister-
shot and a gold                knee-buckle       similarly fossilised.        Wherever the
limestone rock has been exposed to the weather, it gets encrusted
with crystallised                     that in any place where a
                            stalagtitic matter,        so
hollow or trough occurs on the surface of the rock, water falling
or flowing        into   it,   stands.    In    these circumstances      it   is   not difficult
to see      how water, filtering at first through to the roof of                       a   cave,
might, in the course of time, have its course diverted from the spot
where       it   used to drop abundantly,             or at all events, how          it   should
diminish in quantity.                It   is   therefore    reasonable to infer, that in
the early      history of the caves, the water flowed through the roofs
much        more copiously than afterwards.   The cracks and interstices
in    the porous rock would become gradually filled up, so as to cut
off or      curtail the flow of water, and consequently lessen the supply
of   calcareous precipitate.
     On these grounds the author                  entirely repudiated the notion that
this stalagmite had taken                 the enormous        period to grow, indicated
 by   the   foregoing calculation, — though what period                   it       actually did
take, there were no data to determine.
   In concluding, the author referred to the probable origin of these
caves.  He considered that they had originally consisted of great
masses of loose sand which bad become enveloped incompact lime
stone.     Lieut. Nelson, in his paper describing the excavations for
       dockyard, mentioned that
                                  " the irregular
the                                               density of the rock
is    exhibited      on all scales, from minute flaws and patches, to large
masses       dry sand, which more than once occurred during the pro
            of
gress    of our excavations in the heart of otherwise hard, sound rock."
He says that             these beds of dry sand lay just above the level of
high water, and were                " covered by cliffs of good rock sometimes

50 feet high."        The extent to which shelly sand was thrown                 up by
the waves on the shores of the island, and then blown by the S.W.
winds, so as actually to form hills of 180 feet in height, had                    been
described      by Lieut.     Nelson, and the authorhimself distinctly
remembers them, along the south side of the island. It seemed
probable that the rain-water, containing as it does a certain amount
of carbonic acid gas, had, by percolating through the sand-dunes
in ancient times, hardened and consolidated the calcareous sand,
down to a certain depth, into solid rock                  ;   and this result would    be
all the more likely        if,   at   a   former period of the earth's history,        as
many geologists supposed, the earth's atmosphere then contained                        a
larger proportionof carbonic acid gas.  The compact limestone
rock having been formed in this way, enclosing and lying above
huge masses of sand,   was suggested that in the course of time
                             it
the sand had been          undermined             and washed out by the action         of
the sea.      It   was understoodthat every one of the Bermuda caves
are    at or near the sea-level, and have pools of salt-water in them.
3.    Meteorological Observations on Storms of Wind in October,
      November, and December of 1863. By Alexander Buchan,
      M.A., Secretary to the Scottish Meteorological Society.
     The author, had traced eleven distinct storms of wind                     passing
over parts of Europe, between the 26th October and 18th December.
With the view of ascertaining the state of the atmosphere during
the progress of these storms, in respect of pressure, temperature,
wind, cloud, and rain, he had collected                   observations from all parts
of Great Britain and Ireland,                as   well   as from   many places on the
Continent.         He found that each storm               was    marked by concentric
circles     of equal atmospheric             pressure.        Generally, the point     of
greatest barometric depression was 28-5 inches, round which,                      as   a
centre, the isobarometric             lines could   be traced up to 30 inches.
     These isobarometric         lines, especially when near the central          area
of minimum pressure,               circular, or nearly so — when they
                             were often                                   ;
were elliptic, the longer axis generally coincided with the direction
in which the storm moved.
     In   the great majority of the cases investigated,              the storm moved

                        of Edinburgh,        Session 1864-65.                       429
towards some          point of the quadrant between north-east and south
east.       In one     case the movement         had been from the north-east              ;
but this had soon receded or disappeared, apparently                  absorbed by a
new storm from the south-west.
     The observations on temperature               indicated   that before    a storm
from south-westward            reached a place, the temperature rose, and after
it had passed, the temperature fell at that place.
     The direction        of the wind in the storm was ascertained to                   be
pretty nearly coincident with tangents to the isobarometric                    curves,
though with a tendency to turn inwards towards the centre.                          The
author considered that he had established that all storms marked
by a low barometer, and            moving north-easterly,       rotated from right
to   left, looking northwards.
     With regard to the violence of the winds, he found that it                     was
greatest where          the isobarometric       curves (having each a difference
of two-tenths     of an inch) were closest to each other ; — when these
lines,     whether of high or of low pressure, were far apart, the wind
was moderate.
4.   On the Use of Graphic               Kepresentations of Chemical
                      Formula.       By Dr A. Crum Brown.
     The idea of atomicity, or the definite             equivalence    of chemical
atoms, is the necessary consequence   of the theory of replacement.
It was employed by Frankland to explain the nature of the organo-
metallic bodies, and its application was further extended by Kolbe
to a      large number of organic substances.
     It   is,   however, to Kekule that we owe the complete generalisation
of this idea and its systematic              application to all classes of com
pounds.           This first rendered   it   possible to represent, as   it   is   often
advantageous          to do, the constitution of compounds          by completely
dissected formulae. The most convenient way of doing this   to                     is
employ some suitable system of graphic notation.
  Kekule himself, in his
                           " Lehrbuch," made use of    system            a
which       has the advantage           of compactness     and clearness,      but      is
limited in its application to those compounds                 in which the poly
atomic atoms form          a   single chain.     In   order to obviate this incon
venience,       I   proposed, in my thesis presented to the Medical Faculty

430                       Proceedings      of the Royal        Society
of the University in 1861, a form of graphic notation which, while
inferior in compactness to that of Kekulé, appears to me preferable,
as being at leastequally clear and applicable to every formula                                   in
accordance with the theory of atomicity.
  In     an able and suggestive paper published                   in the        " Bulletin       de
la Société Chimique de               Paris" for February 1865, Kekulé                      uses   a
modification          of his original notation,          which to          a great        extent
removes my first objection to              it,   but at the same time              lays   it   open
to another and more serious one —that of obscurity and ambiguity.
That this      is    not an imaginary or trivial defect              is   made evident            by
the circumstance  that Kekulé has himself, in the paper referred to,
been led into an error by his notation. In a foot note, pp. 103 and
104,     he says     : — " On conçoit cependant au point de vue                            de     la

city does not admit of more than two substances having the formula
C3H,   (HO).       In reference to the last sentence quoted from Kekule,
I  shall only remark that his view is not borne out by fact in the
 case of hydrate of propylene,          as Berthelot has shown that it is
 identical with the alcohol derived from acetone.

       1.  On Confocal Conies.         By H. Fox Talbot, Esq.
2.  On the Celtic Topography of Scotland.             By W. F.     Skene,
                                   Esq.
   The author commenced by distinguishing between an etymology
of names of places founded upon mere resemblance of sounds, and
one where the names are analysed          according  to fixed laws,  based
upon sound philological principles and a comprehensive observation
of facts.    The former is the ordinary process to which they           are
subjected, and has characterised       all systematic attempts hitherto
made to analyse the topography of Scotland.           It can lead only to
fanciful renderings, and is incapable of yielding any certain results,
while the latter becomes an important element in fixing the eth
nology of the inhabitants of a country. Names of places undergo
a process   of change and corruption.         The language from which
they were derived has likewise gone through a process of change
and decay, and an interpretation based upon mere resemblance of
sounds, in the present form of the names of places, to words in          an
existing language, ignores this fact and can only mislead.        In  order
to obtain a sound etymology     it is necessary to ascertain the old  form
of the name, and to analyse it in conformity with the             phonetic
laws of the language from which it sprung.

                         of Edinburgh,      Session 18G4-65.                    433
      The author then showed the fallacy of the system of phonetic
  etymology,      on which the conclusions        of Pinkerton, Chalmers, and
  others were based, and        that the attempts hitherto made to discri
  minate      between that part of the population speaking a Kymric,
  from that      speaking a Gaelic dialect, from the topography of the
 districts,    was founded upon an inaccurate conception of the facts
 and     a false     view of the dialectic differences.           In  especial,  he
 showed      that the attempt to draw a line of demarcation between
 them     from the respective prevalence of the terms Aber and Inver,
 was    founded upon an incomplete             and inaccurate     apprehension    of
 the real facts        of the  case,   and was not borne out by the actual
topography        of the country.
     The author then explained           a table he had prepared, showing       the
geographical distribution           of   a complete   list of the terms which
enter     into the Celtic topography of Scotland.             This table showed
 the   number of times that each term occurred in Ireland or in
Wales,       and likewise in every county of Scotland,            and to a great
extent      disproved     the assumed facts upon which the deductions
usually made from the topography,              are based.
     This table likewise showed that there were four terms peculiar
to the      districts inhabited by the Picts, and these words belonged
to the     Gaelic and not to the Kymric branch of the Celtic.
    The author then showed that some of the terms belonged to an
older form       of the language than others, and after giving examples
of   this, he concluded by stating the following as the results of his
investigation      : —
    1.   In order to draw     a correct inference from the names         of places
as   to the ethnologic character of the people who imposed them, it
is
     necessary to obtain the old form of the name before it became
corrupted, and to analyse          it according to the phonetic laws of the
language to       which it belongs.
    2.   A comparison of the generic terms affords the best test for
discriminating between the different dialects to which they belong,
&nd    for   this comparison it is necessary to have          a correct  table of
their    geographical distribution.
    3.  Difference      between the generic       terms   in different   parts of
the    country may arise from           their belonging to     a different  stage
of the     same language,      or from a capricious       selection  of different
    vol. v.                                                            3 l

   434               Proceedings     of  the  Royal Society
   synonyms by different tribes, as well as from a real dialectic differ
   ence between the languages from         which they were derived.
      4.  In order to afford   a test for  discriminating between     dialects,
   the generic    terms must contain within them those sounds which
   are  differently affected by the phonetic laws of each dialect.
      5. Applying this test, the generic terms in Scotch topography
   do not show the existence of a Kymric language north of the Firths
  of Forth and Clyde.
      6. We find in the topography of the north-east of Scotland
  traces of an older and of a more recent form of Gaelic. The one
  preferring labials and dentals, and the other gutturals. The one
  hardening the consonants into termes, the other softening them by
  aspiration.     The one depositing Abers and Invers simultaneously,
  the other Invers alone.        The one a low Gaelic dialect, the other
 a   high Gaelic dialect, the one probably the language of the           Piets,
 the other that of the Scots.

     Lauder Lindsay, M.D., F.L.S., Hon. Member of the Philo
     sophical Institute of Canterbury, New Zealand.
     The North Island flora has hitherto been regarded (in the absence
 of a knowledge of the South Island flora) as representing the
 general vegetation of our New Zealand possessions.            But  the New
 Zealand Islands extend through          thirteen  degrees of latitude, and
the floras of their northern and southern extremes necessarily pre
sent various marked        differences.     The former flora is  more sub
tropical, and the latter more antarctic in its affinities.      The   former,
morever, is richer in natural orders, genera, and species.
    Until very recently, however, comparatively little or nothing          was
known of the Otago flora, all collections          previous to 1861 having
been made on its coast, and       with  a  single limited exception    on it*

    Five species had not been previously found in New Zealand ;
twenty-two had not been previously found in Otago                thirty were
rare   in Otago    ; and twenty-five   species indigenous     in Otago were
British.
    In addition to these and to the total of 235 species, there were
twenty-seven species of British plants naturalised        in Otago, making
a  total of 262.
    Between 1862 and 1864, the interior of Otago has been explored
by the Government        Geological Survey, and the collections made by
the botanist    attached thereto have largely added to our knowledge
of the flora, more especially      of its western alps and great central
lake basins.
    The author in his paper (which refers only to Phaenogams, Ferns,
and their allies) endeavours to give the great characteristics of the
flora of Otago, as a type more especially of the southern flora of
New Zealand, and he draws a comparison            between the flora of the
south and    of the north.    The subject is treated mainly in     a  tabular
and   statistical manner.

   5. On   the Composition of some Old Wines.                   By Douglas
              Maclagan, M.D., Curator Roy. Soc. Edin.
   The samples of wine were furnished             to Dr Maclagan by the Earl
of Dalhousie ; they had been found           in a recess  in a wall in Panmure
House,   which was known to have          been  built up in 1715  ;  the samples
were   consequently      at least 150 years old.
   The wines submitted          to examination were three in number, and
were   contained     in quart bottles, resembling       those ordinarily in use
at the  present day.      They were, when sent to Dr Maclagan, securely
corked ; evaporation had, however, gone on to a sensible extent in
two of the bottles, the third being nearly full.
   No. 1. — Bottle No.      1 contained 21 fluid ounces of wine, its capacity
being 25    fluid ounces.      The fluid was carefully decanted, and thus
separated    from    a considerable quantity of dark red apothema.
    The fluid separated by decantation was slightly turbid, the tur
bidity not disappearing        on filtration.    Its colour was a pale tawny
brown.     It    possessed    a distinct vinous      aroma, which when          the
bottle was     first opened, resembled very closely that of claret.               In
addition   to the vinous, there was         a  distinctly acetous odour.         Its
density at 60°      Fahr.  was 995-42.
    The acids of the wine were separated by precipitating first with
ordinary,    and then with basic acetate of lead, and decomposing the
separate precipitates       by sulphuretted     hydrogen, and testing.         The
 wine was     found    to contain    tartaric and tannic acids, besides sul
 phuric and phosphoric        acids and chlorine in a state of combination.
 It contained no racemic acid.
    The results of a quantitative analysis were the following             : —
      Water in 1000 parts,                                          918-414
      Alcohol,                                                       70000
      Acetic acid,                                                     3 906
      Tartaric acid,                                                   3-187
      Sugar,                                                            -654
      Soluble salts,                                                   1-6,2
      Insoluble salts,           .                                     1::  ;0
    In the above analysis the total acidity of the wine was deter
 mined by means of a standard alkaline solution ; the fluid having

 438                Proceedings      of the Royal   Society
 then been acidified with sulphuric acid, was distilled.          The   acidity
 of the distillate was then determined          by means of the standard
 alkaline solution      ; from the amount of alkali used in the second
 determination,     the acetic acid was determined,       it being    assumed
 that this was the only volatile acid present.          By subtracting      the
 amount of alkali required to neutralise the volatile acid, from            the
 total amount required to neutralise the wine, was found the amount
 of alkali required to neutralise the fixed acid.       The calculation     was
 made on the assumption           that the only fixed acid present in the
 wine was tartaric acid.        The assumption    is an erroneous     one, but
 was adopted, so     that the analysis     might compare with other wine
analyses, which are usually conducted on this plan.
   The sugar was determined in the wine which had been treated
with acetate of lead, and subsequently with sulphuretted hydrogen,
by boiling with Fehling's solution, and determining by the balance
the amount of copper reduced.
    The sediment (apothema) of the wine was examined, and found
to contain much tannic acid, in combination with the red colouring
matter of the wine, besides tartrate of potash.
   No.   2. — The bottle was     full to the neck of a wine  having the     un
mistakable     flavour,    and average colour, of Madeira.        Though it
was   very acid, it was by no means undrinkable.              Its density     at
60°  Fahr.   was 989-7.
   It  contained a trace of tannin, but no tartaric acid.        The   amount
of sulphuric acid and chlorine which it contained            appeared to     be
unusually large.
   Its complete       examination has been prevented by other, and
                                            ....

    The total amount of free acid in 1000 parts was determined by
means of a standard solution of soda, and found to be equal to 5-37
parts   of caustic soda. The amount of acetic acid was not separately
determined.         This wine contained a very large quantity of tannic
acid still in solution, besides the large amount which had been pre
cipitated in combination          with red colouring matter.     It  contained
no   tartaric acid in solution.        The exact amount of sugar was not
determined      ;  it was, however, decidedly small.
    6.   Preliminary Note on the Colouring Matter of Peziza
                   ceruginosa. By Dr A. Crum Brown.
    The Peziza      ceruginosa   is a fungus  belonging to the family Asco-
mycetes,      and order Elvellaceae.       Although the fructification is not
often    met with, the plant itself is by no means rare, growing on
 dead wood,       chiefly of the oak, birch, and ash. It has an intense
green    colour, and tinges the wood on which it grows to a consider
able depth.
    The raw material upon which my investigations were made was
 derived partly from the plant itself, but to a much larger extent
 from the wood upon           which it had grown, or was growing.*        I am
 indebted for the wood and the plants to Dr Alexander Dickson, at
 whose suggestion        I  undertook   this research.
    As   Dr Dickson had observed that the colouring matter dissolves
 without apparent change in the strong mineral acids, but is spar
 ingly soluble in dilute acids,        I employed the following method for
 its isolation    :—
     The wood, broken into small pieces, was placed in         a large  funnel,
    * In order to determine with certainty the connection between the green
 wood and the Peziza, Mr M'Nab of the Botanic Garden exposed pieces of the
 wood, which showed no trace of the fructification, to heat and moisture, when
 large crops of the fungus were obtained.

440                      Proceedings            of the Royal     Society
containing       a email asbestos            filter, and the funnel        was filled with
strong commercial nitric acid.  The acid was completely saturated,
after passing two or three times through the wood. The solution
had a dark-green              colour       by reflected, and a deep-purple          red by
transmitted,          When poured into water, a copious but ex
                     light.
tremely light flocculent precipitate, of a bright-green colour, was
produced, which slowly subsided, leaving the supernatant liquid
nearly colourless.             As this precipitate           was found       to possess the
same properties, whatever                  acid was used in its preparation,          I    had
no hesitation in using nitric acid, which is by far the best solvent.
On attempting          to wash     the precipitate           with distilled water,    either
by decantation or on a filter,               I found    that, while nearly insoluble in
moderately       dilute acid, it dissolves                 to a considerable     extent in
water, even when the latter                     contains     distinct traces of acid.           I
therefore    had recourse to the method of dialysis to get rid of the
acid.
   The acid liquid containing the green matter in suspension was
placed on a dialysor, consisting of a sheet of parchment paper,
stretched over a double ring of gutta-percha, and floating in a vessel
containing distilled water.  After two or three days (the water
being frequently renewed) the nitric acid was found to be entirely
removed, and the contents of the dialysor consisted of a green
liquid, and      a   dark-green        precipitate.        The latter left   a small white
ash on    ignition     ;   and as the quantity of ash bore no constant rela
tion to the quantity of green matter, it was obvious that the sub
stance was still impure.                   In   order to purify it further,     I took     ad
vantage of its solubility in alkalies, and dissolved                   it in the   smallest
possible quantity of very dilute ammonia.                      The brown solution         thus
obtained was filtered, allowed to stand several days in the dialysor,
and precipitated            by means of hydrochloric acid.                   The acid     was
as removed by dialysis,            and a green liquid and precipitate              obtained
before.     This      was     dried in     vacuo over      sulphuric acid.
  The substance thus obtained is                   a   very light powder, almost black
when viewed in             mass,   dark bluish-green when finely divided, and
is probably nearly pure.               I   have, however, not yet analysed          it,   as   it
still leaves   a     decided trace of ash              and     am unwilling to expend
the small quantity at my disposal until
                                                   ;
                                                         I I  have made further efforts
to obtain   in
            it  state of purity.

                       of Edinburgh,                Session 1864-65.                               441
     As before stated, the substance dissolves readily in the strong
mineral acids, and to a considerable                       extent       in glacial acetic acid.
These solutions             are       precipitated       by water.         It   also dissolves in
water and          chloroform.           All   these solutions            are   green.       It   is in
soluble in alcohol           and ether.            It   is soluble with a brown colour in
alkaline solutions.         When no excess of alkali has been used, these
solutions are       precipitated green by dilute acids ; but when allowed
to stand, even        for   a few minutes, with excess                  of alkali, they undergo
a change,         and acids then produce a slimy-brown precipitate.                                The
same      change takes place when the aqueous or alkaline solution is
heated to 100° Cent.
    The neutral ammonia solution gives precipitates of a dirty green
or brown colour            with most metallic solutions.
    When the substance is fused with dry caustic potash, a power
ful ammoniacal odour is given                   off :     It   therefore contains nitrogen.
    These observations                 lead to the conclusion            that the substance is
a weak      acid, and that it forms compounds of slight stability with
the stronger acids.                  Any speculations          as to   its nature   are, however,
premature,         until    we obtain analyses             of the body itself, and of some

  1.   Some Observations          on the Cuticle in relation to Evapo
      ration.       By John Davy, M.D., F.R.S. Lond. & Edin.
    In this paper the author gives an account of many experiments
made on the loss        of weights of different animals in their fresh state,
when suspended, exposed to the air, from evaporation                  ;  from the
results of which he infers, that          it is comparatively greatest from
the hatrachians,        not quite so great from fishes, less from mammalia,
and least from birds.
     Physiologically considered, he infers that the function, in all but
the fishes, is connected with the regulation of animal heat, tending
 to keep the cool-blooded        hatrachians    cool, and birds of a high tem
 perature warm.
     Viewed     pathologically,   he shows how      it tends to prevent inspis-
sation and      drying, and    to preserve the blood      in  a healthy,   and the
 tissues    in a  flexible, moist state.
     In addition,     he gives an account    of  some    similar trials   on vege
 tables,   in which the cuticular covering performs a part in relation
 to the   retarding of evaporation and the preservation of life, similar
 to that    which it exercises on animals.
     He concludes with calling attention          to the   drying of meats and
 vegetables      in  an economical   point of view, and with the expression
 of regret that these in their dried state — so much used in the
 United States of America, and on the Continent, and so easily
 obtained, considering the simplicity of the process, are not more
 used   in Great Britain, especially by the labouring class.

3.   Note on the Behaviour of Iron Filings, strewn on a
     vibrating plate, and exposed to the action of a magnetic
     pole.        By Professor Tait.
     While    a   horizontal plate is in       a state    of rapid vibration            (as   in
Chladni's experiments), iron filings strewed on the surface, near a
point of maximum vibration, are prevented from being scattered to
the nodal lines by a magnetic pole held above the plate, but,                            if   the
pole be held below, they are speedily dissipated.                     If    too powerful
a pole he         used, or   if   the magnet be held too near the plate, the
filings nearest to the pole are not dispersed in the latter case. men                   I
tion this curious fact (which was observed recently by Mr Talbot
and myself), on account of its explanation,     which is very simple.
     The filings tend to place their greatest length in the direction                          of
lines of magnetic force           ;   and thus, when the pole is above the plate,
their upper ends incline inwards to   so that the agitation of the
                                                  it,
plate, combined with the magnetic attraction, brings them nearer
to the point immediately               below the pole.      When the pole          is       below
the plate, the upper ends of the filings diverge from the pole, and
the agitation sends them outwards, unless the magnetic attraction
be considerable.

papers,* more especially to that in which he had described several
specimens of the scaphocephalic                skull, in which he had             discussed
the influence         exercised        on the production      of deformities            of    the
cranium,      by    a   premature       closure or      obliteration of the         sutures,

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1864-65.                              445
 and   Dr John Thurnam,*                the    author    proceeded    to relate   two
additional cases of scaphocephalus                 to those he had already         re
corded.      He had met with one of these in the head of a living
person,    the other in a skull in the Natural History Museum of the
University of Edinburgh.
    The first case occurred           in   a  young man, a native of Scotland,
and was a     very characteristic         specimen.      The great elongation and
lateral compression        of the skull in the parietal region were well ex
hibited, the sagittal ridge was strongly pronounced, and the flat
tening of the skull on each side of the ridge                    was    considerable.
The head was       9  inches long      ;   and this great elongation      was chiefly
displayed in the bulging backward of the occipital region, for there
was no marked           projection       of the forehead.       The characteristic
shape   of this youth's head was congenital, for it had been observed
from   his earliest infancy, and his birth was attended with consider
able  difficulty. He was of studious habits, and very intelligent.
For in these cases of scaphocephalism there is not necessarily any
intellectual deficiency,         as the impeded       growth of the skull in the
transverse     direction from early obliteration of the sagittal suture is
compensated for by the increased growth in the antero-posterior,
and the growth       of the brain though            restricted in one direction is
permitted     in another.        Hence,      the cubic capacity    of these crania
does  not seem      to be below the mean of the race or races in which
they have been found           ;  one of the skulls the author had formerly
described   — 117     a,  Edinburgh          University    Anatomical Museum —
having a capacity        as  high    as 108 cubic inches.
   The skull in the Natural History Museum is that of an Egyptian
mummy,       and was described            and figured as such by the late Mr
Andrew Fyfe, in his          " Illustrations of the
                                                          Anatomy of the Human
Body."   f     He states, that " it is remarkable, not only for its length
and   narrowness,      but for the strong          impression    made by the tem
poral muscle, and        for the sharpness of the arches of the forehead
and  occiput ;" but he says nothing of the condition of the sagittal
suture, and apparently         regards the skull as a characteristic        specimen
of the ancient       Egyptian       cranium.      Conjoined,    however, with this

 length and narrowness are an absence of parietal eminences, a com
 plete obliteration of the sagittal suture, a keel or ridge along the
 sagittal line, and such          a complete    blending of the two       parietal
 bones, that   it must    be pronounced      to be a typical specimen of         the
 scaphocephalic      skull.      Hence it cannot    be regarded as expressing
 the normal form of head of the ancient               Egyptian, but simply as
 an individual peculiarity due to premature closure of the sagittal
 suture, and possessing no ethnological value.               For skulls of this
 form may apparently occur in any race, and in any clime, as well in
 the old Egyptian as in the Scotchman             of the present day.*
    As minor characters in this cranium, may be noticed, that                    the
 lateral, longitudinal, and vertical transverse lines of sutures                  are
 marked externally, but probably obliterated             internally.     The   fore
 head is rounded       and projecting in the region of the frontal             emi
 nences, but behind these tubera the frontal bone has a roof-like
 form.     The biparietal bone has no beak jutting forward into                  the
 frontal, and there     are   indications of the former presence of        parietal
 foramina.     A   narrow beak runs forward from the superior             angle of
 the occipital bone into the biparietal bone.              The facial bones       are
broken away, and the cavity of the skull is             full of  a black bitumi
 nous-like material.        The skull is apparently that of         a person past
 the middle    period of life, but whether male or female is somewhat
uncertain,    though    it is probably the latter.

of examining the very remarkable skull-cap next described, the
author was indebted to Professor Maclagan, who, on account of
some circumstances                         connected         with the death of the person to
whom   it belonged, possessing a                             medico-legal interest, had had it
sent him by Dr T. J. Maclagan of Dundee.*     The skull-cap was
from a woman Eet. 25. In the inter-parietal part of the occipital
bone an oval opening,                         with a smooth rounded margin, existed in
the    middle line.                    Its long axis was vertical, and measured                            one
inch       ;   its transverse diameter was a little more than half an inch at
the widest part.                      A    suture extended             upwards from the upper end
of this opening in the middle line, as far as the superior                                           angle of
the bone.             This hole was, in the recent state, filled up by                                a mem
brane.           In   the posterior               slope of each parietal bone an oval open
ing, with a rounded                        margin,     was situated.           The long axis of each
was transverse              ;       that on the right side -^ths, that on the left                      ^ths
of    an       inch long        ;   whilst the antero-posterior                diameter on the widest
part, on the          right side, was ^ths, on the left -j^ths of an inch.
These          openings were filled up in the recent state with a cribriform
membrane.              A    suture passed from the inner end of the left parietal
opening almost transversely                           inwards for about half an inch, when it
reached the           middle line, and then extended downwards and back-                                         *

position of the posterior                         part of the sagittal           suture.            The right
parietal         opening             had no suture                proceeding    from     it,   though there
were           appearances            as     if                 The parietal

openings          by their outer ends were close to elevations in the bones,
which   evidently corresponded to the parietal tubera.
     The inner surface of the skull-cap, in front of the parietal
openings,          was marked by the groove for the superior longitudinal
sinus along the middle  line; opposite these apertures   was deflected,                 it

Anteriorly, the right parietal bone sent forward into the            frontal   a
beak similar to those the author had described in some of             the sca-
phocephalic crania recorded in his former paper.         Traces of   a suture,
visible   only externally, might    be seen   commencing      at the coronal
suture, immediately to the left of the base of the beak.                It   ex
tended in an interrupted      manner backward       for about   an inch and
a half, and then disappeared,        so that   from   this spot,   to a point
midway between the two parietal        openings, the sagittal suture was
entirely obliterated,    and the two parietal      bones were completely
blended together.       The other sutures of the skull-cap         were well
marked, both internally and externally.
   The author then discussed the probable modes of production of
these malformations.       He argued that the opening in the occipital
bone was due to want of union in the middle line of the ossific
spicula proceeding from the two centres of ossification          from    which
the inter-parietal,  or cerebral, part of the occipital bone is developed.
The malformation      might  be compared, therefore,    with the deficiency
in the neural arches of the spinal column, occasioning a spina bifida.
The two large openings in the parietal bones were of a different
nature  :  they were not congenital      deficiencies in the middle line         ;
they did not occur along the line of junction of spicula — proceeding
from ossific centres orginally distinct, but were placed laterally,
and each was situated       between the eminence       which seemed        to be
the centre of ossification   for the parietal bone in which it      occurred,
and the middle line.     The openings, indeed, occupied the position           of
the parietal foramina, but were many times larger than those aper
tures are in a normal skull.      The possibility of these being greatly
exaggerated    vascular   foramina was then discussed, the cribriform
condition of the membrane closing them over, and the relations                 of
the grooves for the venous sinuses internally, seemed to favour such
a conclusion.     Abnormalities in the construction         of the    bones of
the skull-cap, i.e. of the bones developed in membrane, are appa
rently more frequent than those of the basis cranii, which are de
veloped in cartilage.      This is probably clue to the circumstance,
that the areas of the different bones are less precisely defined,           and

 that the process     of ossification is more liable to disturbance in the
 former    than    the latter.    The modifications     in arrangement are
especially apt to occur along the lines of apposition of adjacent
osseous areas, t. e., along sutural lines, or along the margins of
junction of the subdivisions         of a bone proceeding from distinct
centres; and in these localities it is that the anatomist so fre
quently meets with Wormian or triquetral bones, or occasionally with
a beak     projecting from one bone into an adjacent one, or with
the   not unfrequent blending of one bone with another along the
sutural lines.
  5.  On Saturated Vapours.             By W.    J. Macquorn Rankine,
              C.E., LL.D., F.R.SS. Lond. and Edin., &c.
    As this paper consists almost wholly of formulas, calculations,
and tables,     it is not suited for being read to   a meeting  ; and there
fore the    following short abstract of its contents is alone offered for
the purpose      of being read aloud : —
    In the "Edinburgh Philosophical Journal" for July 1849, the
 author proposed the       following formula for the pressure of saturated
 vapour   corresponding to a given boiling point : —
 where t is the absolute temperature,      reckoned from the absolute zero ;
 and  A, B, and C      are three specific constants, to be determined   from
 at least  three experiments      on each substance   ;  and he showed that
 the results     of that formula agreed better with experiment than
 those   of any other formula containing three constants only.             In
 a series   of papers on the Mechanical Action of Heat, read to the
 Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1850, and subsequent years, and in
 other  publications also, the same formula is explained, and its use
 exemplified in various ways.           The first division of the present
 paper gives the results of the computation of the values of the con
 stants  A, B, and C for several fluids for which they had not          been
 previously computed, the data being taken from the second volume
of M. Regnanlt's " Rolation des Experiences, &c.," published                in
    vol.  v.                                                      3 N

450                 Proceedings       of the Royal    Society
1862   ;  and  it is also shown that by the formula            a  conclusion    was
anticipated,    which M. Regnault has deduced from his experiment!!,
viz., that   " Me elastic force of a vapour does not increase indefinitely
with the temperature, but converges towards a limit which it cannot
exceed."     (" Relation    des  Experiences," vol. ii. page 647.)
    The second division of the paper is occupied chiefly with               a com
parison between the actual values of the pressures of saturation of
the vapours of various fluids, and the values which those pressures
would have      if the vapours were perfectly gaseous.             In  the first of
the papers already referred to, read to the Royal Society of Edin
burgh,    and published       in their Transactions in 1850, the             author
                                                          that the " total
                                                                                     '
proved from the principles of thermodynamics                                  heat
of evaporation of a perfectly gaseous vapour must             be represented in
dynamical units by the expression
                                     Jb  + Je/t,
where    I is a constant    to be found by experiment,       c   the specific   heat
of the vapour at constant pressure, and           J the dynamical equivalent
of an unit of heat, t being the absolute temperature as before. In a
paper read to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1855, but not pub
lished, the same formula was shown to express, in dynamical units,
the total heat of gasefication of any substance under any constant
pressure, when the final absolute temperature is t.                 In the present
paper the author equates that expression            to another expression for
the total heat of evaporation,          from the absolute zero, at         a given
absolute temperature t, as        follows : —
 in which v and      v" are  the volumes of unity of weight            of the sub
stance in the gaseous and liquid              states respectively,       under   the
pressure p, and at the absolute temperature            t.   Then putting       for  v
 its value in the perfectly gaseous state — namely,
where c is the specific heat of the gas at constant volume, and                  ne
glecting    v" as very  small in comparison with v, there is found, by in
tegration, the following value of the hyperbolic logarithm of the

The pressures of various vapours, as calculated on the supposition
of their being perfectly gaseous by means of the preceding equa
tions, are compared with their actual pressures;                   the general result
being,      that when the vapours are rare, the differences                 are small,
and that when the densities             increase, the differences increase.          For
example,       in the   case  of steam, the pressures calculated by equation
 B agree       very closely with the actual pressures from 0° to 160°
 Cent.   ;   but above the latter temperature the difference gradually
 becomes considerable,          and at 220° Cent, is about one-fiftieth part
 of the whole pressure.              At  0° Cent. 1 pound         of saturated steam
 occupies 3400 cubic feet          ;  at 160° Cent, about 5 cubic feet         ; and at
 228° Cent, about 1-4 cubic foot.
     The author       also makes some comparisons                between the actual
 volumes      of saturated vapours at given boiling-points, and the calcu
 lated volumes       which they would fill if they were perfectly gaseous               ;
 and    also between        the actual latent heat of evaporation,              and the
 calculated      latent heat of perfect gasefication.             The general results
 are   in accordance with            what     is already     known, — viz., that the
 actual volumes         of vapours    are   less than those corresponding         to the
 perfectly      gaseous state, and the actual latent heat of evaporation
  less  than the latent heat of gasefication              ;  and the author further
  points out that the differences in the case               of steam increase nearly
  as the absolute temperature.

6. On the       Ganglia and Nerves of the Heart, and their con
   nection with the Cerebro-Spinal and Sympathetic Systems
   in Mammalia. By James Bell Pettigrew, M.D., Edin
   burgh, Assistant in the Museum of the Royal College of
    Surgeons of England.
   The Memoir, of which the subjoined            is an abstract, is   based
upon seventy dissections, and is intended as a contribution         to our
knowledge        of the arrangement     of the    cardiac   nerves in    the
mammalia.
   It  has the five following objects in view     : —
   1st.  To describe the parts of the sympathetic        and vagus, which
furnish branches to the heart.
   2d.   To trace the branches given ofT by the sympathetic and
vagus, till they disappear in the great cardiac plexuses.
   3d. To unravel the plexuses, so as to show the manner in which
they   are formed, and how they resolve themselves.
   llh. To point out the arrangement of the nerves on the       pulmonary
artery and aorta, and on the surface and in the substance of             the
auricles and ventricles.
   5th.   To demonstrate the existence of certain nervous          enlarge
ments on the surface and in the substance of the heart generally,
and to show that these enlargements         are true ganglia, and contain
innumerable       unipolar and bipolar nerve-cells.
   In   the first part of the investigation, the cardiac branches       fur
nished by the sympathetic        and vagus have been examined in         the
cat, calf, and rabbit, and also in man      ; but the author is indebted
for his results chiefly to the three former, the nervous system      of the
domestic animals being, in his opinion, especially interesting,       as the
animals      themselves   are  admirably   adapted for the purposes        of
vivisection.
   The chief points of difference to      be noted   in the cardiac  nerves
of the animals referred       to, occur in the sympathetic,     and  are M
follows   : —
   In the    cat, the cardiac nerves  furnished by the sympathetic      pro

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1864-65.                            453
ceed    from two large solitary ganglia, one of which is situated at the
root   of the neck on the right side, the other on the left.
     In the rabbit, they proceed from four smaller ganglia,                  two of
which are situated on the right side of the root of the neck, the re
maining two on the left.
     In the calf, the number of ganglia furnishing cardiac branches
increase to     six, these being similarly divided and situated.
     The cat, therefore, seems best adapted for physiological pursuits,
and a series     of carefully performed experiments on that animal may
probably be      the means of determining the nature and the extent of
 the influence     exerted by the nerves on the movements of the heart,
 if  indeed   these movements, as the author remarks, are not referable
 to the    gapglia situated in the heart itself, which, from various con
 siderations, he thinks not unlikely.               The heart, e. g., is known to
 contract and dilate for a' considerable period after the blood, which
 is regarded as     its natural stimulus, is abstracted from it.          It further
 acts   regularly when removed from the body and placed under a bell
 jar from which the air has been subsequently exhausted by the
 action    of an air-pump.        In  the frog, moreover, as not unfrequently
 happens, the heart       suddenly      ceases   to contract,  if the base, where
 the    ganglia   are   most numerous,         be   removed by the stroke of a
 scissors.*
     In the second part of the investigation, the great cardiac plexuses
 are   shown to resolve themselves into four minor ones.
      Of these, one      occurs     on   the pulmonary      artery,   and   supplies
 branches to     that surface of the auricles which is directed towards
  the great vessels.      It  also supplies     branches to the right ventricle.
  A second occurs between the pulmonary artery and aorta, and fur
  nishes branches to the anterior            coronary vessels, and to the right
  and   left ventricles,  particularly the latter.        A third    occurs on the
  posterior coronary sinus, and gives branches to the              left auricle and
  ventricle,   especially the latter.       The fourth occupies that surface of
  the  auricles which is directed towards and is in contact with the
  pericardium, and supplies           branches     to the  inferior cava, to the
  auricles, and to the posterior          surface of the right ventricle.        The
     * Brachet declares that   if  the cardiac plexus in mammals be destroyed the
   movements of the heart are suddenly and permanently arrested. — Du Syt'!me

454                   Proceedings of the Royal Society
four minor plexuses           referred        to    supply branches which pursue              a
definite   direction.       Thus the branches               from the plexus, situated
between the pulmonary artery and aorta, and between                             the former
and the right auricle, proceed in a spiral direction from right to
left downwards,        so   that they cross the muscular fibres composing
the ventricles.        The same may     of the branches proceeding
                                               be said
from the plexuses occurring on the posterior surface of the auricles
and on the posterior           coronary            sinus.   By this arrangement              the
nerves distributed to the heart                    are brought into intimate contact
not only with the muscular fibres, but also with the blood-vessels                             ;
and this is important, as           it is on the latter that the ganglia          are most
frequently detected.
   In the third and concluding part of the investigation, the en
largements and fusiform swellings figured by Scarpa* and Leef
have been examined microscopically, and their precise nature ascer
tained.   The hearts examined for this purpose were numerous, and
consisted, among others, of those of man, the horse, ox, camel,
heifer, dog, panther, deer, seal, and pig.
   The ganglia occur           as   irregularly shaped enlargements,               having
three, four, five or more nerves connected with them.                       Sometimes
they appear      as simple      dilatations occurring on the nerves                as they
cross the vessels.      They    are most numerous on the posterior coronary
sinus, where they form a continuous network not hitherto described                             ;
but they are also to be found in large quantities on the vessels and
throughout the substance of the heart generally.
  When     ganglion, with several nerves proceeding from
           a                                                   de                it,   is
tached and treated with carmine and glycerine,           found, on    it   is
microscopic examination, to be crowded with nerve-cells, the poles
of which are directed towards the nerves themselves.                       When        one   of
the swellings or dilatations which occur on the nerves, as they cross
the vessels,    is   similarly treated, the nerve-cells are           seen to form an
oval patch corresponding            in shape with the dilatation, and the poles
of the cells are directed,           as   a   rule, in the direction of the nerve
trunk.     In   some instances the nerves terminate in bulbous expan
sions, and on such occasions the expansions in question are crowded
with nerve-cells, the poles of which are directed towards the attached

   The nerves and nerve-plexuses,         in their various combinations,
and the   ganglia and their contents, have      been   described at length,

   Since this paper was printed        I   have prepared the aldehyd of
alpha-toluic acid.      I shall only  mention here that    it possesses   in  a
very  high degree the smell of honey, which was observed in the
case of the alpha-toluic acid described in the paper; and that it is
probable that that acid contained traces of the aldehyd to which it
owed not    only its smell, but also the excess of carbon and hydrogen
indicated by the analyses.

The President, Sir David Brewster, at the request of                      the
     Council, delivered the following Opening Address: —
Among the various       functions which our scientific institutions        are
expected    to discharge,     not the least important is to foster         the
labours and protect the interests of discoverers and inventors, — of
those who create new forms of matter and new processes of art, —
who invent new instruments,           and new machinery       for controlling
and rendering useful the forces of the material world.
    The rights of property,      in its material    phase, whatever     be its
character, and by whatever means          it has  been acquired,    have ever
been   held   sacred, even in barbarous communities.            The   hoarded
treasure, or the portion of the earth's crust which        it may   purchase,
can be wrested from its owner but by the forfeiture          of crime,  or the
grasp of conquest.         As civilisation advances, new wants         are de
veloped, and new rights established.        The historian, the philosopher,
the antiquary, and the poet — the pioneers of intellectual life— strive
to instruct and amuse us, and claim in return our sympathy and pro
 tection.   Hence has arisen the law of copyright, in virtue of          which
 the author    of any work, however frivolous in its character,           how
 ever immoral in its tendency, however subversive of order,                 and
 however hostile to religion, acquires a right of property which           suc
 cessive Acts of Parliament have enhanced in value, by lengthening
 its tenure and adding to its security.       This just privilege, of which
 the humblest and the highest in the community avail themselves,
 is granted gratuitously by the State, and is enjoyed during the long
 period of forty-eight years, and by the youngest author during the
 whole of his life.
    In  the progress of civilisation, wants other than intellectual          de
 mand     immediate    gratification.    The genius of invention in           ite
 youngest    exercise,   is summoned to feed and to clothe us, to          con
 jure from the inner earth the elements of civilisation, to        strengthen
 the human arm and aid the failing eye, to shield us from the ele
 ments, and to open to the missionary and the merchant the rough

                       of Edinburgh,       Session 1865-66.                 459
  pathway    of the ocean.       In its   manhood,    it is summoned to more
  transcendental     functions; to supply, for the higher civilisation, the
 luxuries    and elegancies of life ; to carry us swiftly and safely over
 earth and ocean;        to navigate the fields of ether; to converse with
 the world,    in accents of lightning, through the air and under the
 deep ; to   hring within our research the most distant star            ; and to
 reveal the    minutest life which swarms beneath us and around us.
     With such functions to discharge, and having discharged them
nobly, the      inventor might have looked for a generous patronage
from    the State, and for a monopoly as free and secure as the copy
right of the author.
    The right     of property in inventions has been acknowledged by
almost     every community in the old and the new world,* and a
patent law has been passed to define            its character, to fix its limit,
and to secure      it against infringement.
    In England,       I grieve   to say, her inventors are more cruelly taxed
than in any other part         of the world.     Though her prosperity, more
than that     of any other nation,         depends on the encouragement of
the   industrial arts, yet she levies from the poor inventor — nay, from
her   best benefactor, the enormous sum of L.175 for a patent-right
of fourteen years.        In France     the same privilege, for fifteen years, is
given for L.60, paid by instalments               of L.4 for each year of its
tenure   ;  and in the United States a patent continues seventeen years,
and costs     only L.7,    6s.  lOd.    In  Sweden and Norway a patent is
given   for fifteen years, for the mere expense of advertising the speci
fication. In other countries the diversities in the expense and en
durance      of patent rights, measure the legislative wisdom which
characterises the laws that pretend to encourage the useful arts ;
and show us how unblushingly the limited means of the poor in
ventor     are transferred      to the pockets of ignorant officials, and, in
this country, accumulated          in the coffers of an overflowing Exchequer.
    The consequences of such ungenerous legislation it is not difficult
to  discover.      The average number of patents granted annually in
 England is 2000, in France 4000, and in the United States 4000 ;
 and hence we are entitled to infer that upwards of 2000 patents are
 annually suppressed in England, and that many valuable inventions
               * Switzerland, China, and Japan have no patent law.

  460                Proceedings      of the Royal     Society
   and processes in the arts are either not perfected by their            authors,
  or employed in secret and for ever lost to society.*
      This is not the occasion to analyse the patent         laws of England,
  and to criticise the principles which are supposed to regulate their
  enactments.       It may be enough       to have referred to the       miserable
  tenure   of fourteen years which they assign to the inventor             ; to the
  crushing tax of L.175 which they levy from him ; to the                   illusory
  privilege which they give him ; to the endless litigation into which
  they lead him ; and to the bankruptcy and ruin in which he ia so
  frequently involved.       There    are, doubtless, cases    in which       patent
  rights have led to fortune, but it is chiefly when the wealthy capi
  talist has come to the rescue of the humble inventor, or when the
  patent has been confirmed by the decision of a court of law.
     The injustice of the patent law has been so fully admitted, that
  various acts of Parliament have been passed in favour of the patentee,
 adding slightly to the protection of his right, and reducing to the
 sum we have mentioned the expense of its attainment                 ;  but no ad
 dition has    been made to the shortness       of its tenure, and     no increase
 of security against direct piracy, or partial infringement.
     Whatever difficulty the statesman may experience in                      giving
 security to the rights of inventors, he can have none in                     giving
 them the same tenure as copyrights,           and conferring them       as gratui
 tously, or at no greater cost than is necessary to cover the             expenses
 of the patent office.
     Between the national claims of authors and inventors                there can
 be no    comparison.       Value    as   you   may, and value highly, the
 treasures of ancient      and of modern       thought, what     are they when
weighed against the inventions of art and science, predominating
over our household         arrangements,      animating our cities        with the
sounds of industry, and covering            with mechanical       life  the earth
and the ocean     ?   The eloquence of the orator, the lesson of           the his
torian, the lay of the poet,      are, as  it were, but the fragrance         of the
plant whose fruit feeds us, and by whose leaves we are                 healed    ; or
    • On this subject the Commissioners state, in their recent Eeport, thai
" They have been pressed with the opinion, that the cost of obtaining letters-
patent ia still so high as to bo an insuperable bar to the poor inventor, in ob
taining the protection to which be is fairly entitled." — Report, p. v. Lond
1866.

                      of Edinburgh,     Session 1865-66.                 461
as  the auroral      tint which gives    a temporary   glory to a rising or a
setting     sun.    But grant    to the favoured genius of copyright its
highest claims, and appreciate         loyally its most fascinating stores,
their value is shared, and largely shared, with that of the type, the
paper, and the press, by which these stores have been multplied
and preserved.         The relative value of books and inventions may be
presented under another phase.             Withdraw from circulation the
secular productions of the press that are hoarded in all the libraries
of the world, and society will hardly suffer from the change.          With
draw the     gifts with which art and science have enriched us — the
substantial realities       through which we live, and move, and enjoy
our  being — and society collapses into barbarism.
    Under the influence of views like these, the friends of inventors
have continued to watch over their interests, and to prosecute im
provements on the Patent Laws.             In this  cause some of tho lead
ing members of the British Association, the Inventors' Institute,
and the      Social Science Congress, have       been  specially active, and
through their exertions the subject was brought before the House
of Commons        in the last session of Parliament.      In the discussions
which took place in the House and in the Commission,               the most
startling opinions were advanced, and by some persons received
with favour.         The entire abolition of Patent Rights was gravely
 proposed, and the Report of the Commission           was not submitted to
the consideration        of Parliament, on the ground that that funda
 mental question should be previously decided.
    Had this proposal to rob the citizen of the most sacred of his
 rights been accompanied with any suggestion that Government
 should give equitable rewards for successful inventions,        even paten
 tees might have welcomed the change         ; but no such suggestions have
been made, and,        judging from the past history of British science
 and art, we cunnot indulge the hope of any such act of national
 liberality.    It is under despotic governments alone that national
 benefactors are rewarded and honoured.           Where mammon is in the
 ascendant,     and the demu.ids of trade         and  commerce    influence
 legislation, intellectual en.'nence must look to other lands for its
  recognition    and    its patronage.     The present     raid against   the
 patent    laws is the direct      aud  acknowledged     result of the un
 generous     influence of trade.       The shortness of the tenure         of

462                           Proceedings          of   the   Royal Society
patent  rights, and the heavy tax levied from inventors, are ex
pressly maintained, in order to diminish the number of patents;
and the avowed reason for thus diminishing them        that from                            is,
their number and frivolity they interfere with the operations                                                   of
tradesmen               and    manufacturers,           by exposing           them        to actions           for
infringement.*
        That there        are many patents              not remunerating,             and not            imme
diately beneficial,                is painfully true, when               we    consider           how     much
they           have     cost       the sanguine inventor.                 That there                are     any
patents really frivolous or useless, in the true sense of these                                          terms,
can be maintained                    only by ignorant or interested parties.                              There
        no patent that does not contain                        proposal to do something that
is is
                                                          a
        new, or to make some improvement                           upon what         is   old ;     and there
are many examples of apparently useless patents containing the
germs of future and valuable inventions. There are cases even                                                   in
which           the invention stigmatised                 as useless has proved                     to    be an
essential element                  in   a   future patent, where the new patentee                              has
piratically used   and dared to complain that he has been
                               it,                                                                        prose
cuted for infringement. But there    still more intelligible  is
                                                               a                                         reason
why no patent                  can be called useless.                In bringing              it    into the
market, workmen are employed, and materials purchased                                           ;   and    even
if      the process, instrument,               or machine           thus offered to the public
has no sale and no useful                          application,      the hapless patentee                      has
        • On this subject the commissioners make the following                        statement —     :
        " The evil arising from the multiplicity of monoplies                    is       alleged   to be         of
twofold nature.               In   the first place, that of the existence of a number                          of a
patents for alleged inventiom of   trivial character
                                               a     in the second place, that

the granting of patents for inventions which are either old or practical!;/ ustlen,
and are employed by the patentee! only to embarrass rival manufacturer!." — Report,
p. v.  London, 1865.
        These allegations          submitted   to the commissioners            are    not supported               by
specific facts, and are the mere opinions of interested parties.      Before giving

                        of Edinburgh,       Session 1865-66.                              463
given liberal fees to several functionaries of the State, and con
tributed nobly to the Patent Fund.
   That any patent is frivolous and injurious, in the sense of inter
fering with the functions of honest traders, is simply untrue. If
an invention which has been                patented at the cost of L.175, and
produced nothing in return, is a necessary part of an important
invention subsequently patented, it is a positive proof that patents
apparently frivolous maybe truly valuable.                   The first invention            is,
therefore, neither an obstacle to improvements,                        nor   a   ground    for
litigation.      It    has, on the contrary,       led to    a    greater        invention  ;
and whether the second patentee has used      ignorantly, or ad
                                                             it
visedly, he ought to pay for the use of                it,
                                        instead of pleading in a
court of law,     as he    generally and dishonestly         does,      that the original
specification     is   defective.
  But    even   if    the cases of interfering patents were more numerous
than they       are, and more       fertile in litigation,   it   is   the lawgiver,      and
not the inventor that           is   to blame.    If   Parliament, in its wisdom,
cannot reconcile the interests of patentees and honest tradesmen
but by robbing the former, they overlook the fundamental law in
social economy, that no great improvement can be made in the
arts of life, and no true reform in our institutions, without inter
fering with      a    variety of interests.
   To         intellectual rights inherent in man, and long recog
        abolish
nised and enjoyed, and this, too, on the single ground of public con
venience, would be retrograde step in legislation, of which history
                            a
affords no example.   As well might the surgeon propose to heal                             a
rheumatic limb by amputation, or the philanthropist reform                                   a
criminal by his execution.
   In proposing         to abolish patent rights, its promoters seem to have
wholly overlooked the international interests that are at stake.                            If
 we have no patent law, we deprive every foreigner of his existing
 right to  British patent. Foreign governments may therefore adopt
            a
 a policy of retaliation, and refuse to our countrymen the patent
 rights which they now so freely enjoy; or, what     more probable,    is
 they may hold out additional privileges to our ingenious artisans,
 and thus obtain the first fruits of their skill. Inventors will fol
 low their inventions, and in the exodus to foreign countries, — to
 the United States, especially, with its cheap and judicious patent

laws, we shall lose, more rapidly than we have yet done, the most
ingenious of our inventors,                 and the most useful of our citizens.
    A policy like this,             so Boeotian      in its character, and so injurious
in its results, is           as   politically unsafe         as   it is socially unwise,            and
personally       unjust.           Rights that have been firmly established                         and
long enjoyed         are not        readily abandoned.              Illiberal and oppressive
as the patent           laws are, they are               still the Magna Charta of                   the
commonwealth    of inventors, and in an age tending to democracy
they will not be surrendered without a struggle.  Rights hitherto
unquestioned, and not more sacred, may be exposed to the same
scrutiny, and social interests                   endangered which                  all classes     have
been accustomed to respect and defend.
    If these views           of patent rights         be   just, and         if,   as moveable pro
perty, they are as sacred as copyrights,                         there can be no         just     reason
why they should not                equally cheap, given to every ap
                                    he granted
plicant, and enjoyed during at least the life of the patentee. When
a philosopher or an artisan offers an invention to the State, and re
ceives an exclusive privilege in exchange, we might expect some
equality between the gift and its reward. In perfecting his inven
tion the inventor has already spent much of his time, and in many
cases exhausted              his means.       When       a   suppliant at the Patent              Office
a   heavy payment             is   demanded, and he purchases                  a    privilege which
may ruin him.          The theory of such    tax   would be difficult to
                                                             a         it

                                               is
for the benefit of non-inventors                     ;   but the object which                it   really
accomplishes            is   to paralyse        inventions;            to cause valuable            pro
cesses    to be wrought              in    secret,   and in many cases to be lost                   ;   to
give fees to clerks                and officers of State, and to create                  a   fund, the
purpose of which has not yet been revealed.                                   A     tax sufficient to
defray the expenses of               a    patent office* might be             justly exacted,        but
to demand        a   sum twenty-fold that amount                        is   a     freak of   finance,

                       of Edinburgh,          Session 1865-66.                     465
 nine years and        a-half, from October 1852 to December                1861, was
 L.772,778, which, at the same rate,                will  be L.l, 001,764  at the end
of the present year ?
    Of the sum of L.772,778 received                 in 1861, L.502,000 has been
expended,       viz., L.96,000 in fees to law officers and their clerks,
who do      nothing for the inventor, and L.406,000 for the expenses
of the Patent Office.
   After all this expenditure, the enormous sum of nearly a quarter
of a million of money, wrenched from the inventive genius of
England, slumbers, unapplied,               in the Exchequer, while our schools
and   universities      are  left  to  starve, and the interests of science and
art consigned to the munificence               of our scientific institutions.
   In discussing         the policy of untaxing, extending, and securing
patent    rights, we may view them in relation to the doctrine of free
trade,   now developing itself in the legislation of every civilised
community.          In    the present state of the law, patent rights may
be   said to be imported          and exported as freely as the instruments
and machines         in which they are embodied ; but in so far as they
are   more taxed in one country than another, the trade in their pro
ducts    and in their privileges cannot be considered                   free.   A   dis
covery    in science, and      a process or     invention in art,    are  gifts offered
to the   families of mankind wherever they are made, and whatever
be   their character.         To fetter their development in one country
while they are fostered               in another,      is   an act of international
injustice,     which free trade disclaims.                 To tax them anywhere,
under any circumstances,              and under any pretence, is a blot upon
political wisdom, an act of cruelty to genius, and a wrong inflicted
upon society at large.
    In tracing the rise and progress of those great inventions and
discoveries which have added to our physical enjoyments                       and con
solidated     our power over the material world, we cannot fail to
recognise     the grand object which, in the arrangements of Provi
dence,   they are meant to accomplish.                 Whatever man is fitted to
understand he is destined to know.                     Whatever has been created
for his use he is destined to enjoy.                We have yet much to learn of
the sidereal     universe      of which      we  form a part ; of the system of
planets     to which our own belongs              ;  of the physical history and
construction of our terrestrial            home    ;  of the organic and inorganic
   VOl. V.                                                                 3 P

 substances which compose           it  ; of the precious materials stored up
 for civilisation  ;  and of those noble forms of life and beauty which
 everywhere appeal to the affections and intelligence               of man.
    But while   we have thus much to learn we have also much to do,
 and whatever we have power to do must eventually be done.                       The
 great inventions which, in          living memories, have        so mysteriously
 altered the social condition of our race, measure to us, however
 feebly, what art and science have          still to accomplish.      Our gigantic
 steam-vessels —our      telegraphs,      aerial and submarine     —our    railways
 — our light-houses, are still in their infancy.              We have yet to     p»M
 through the      sea   with a surer compass, a sharper prow, and a
 stronger impulse.       We have yet to speak more articulately through
the air and beneath the ocean.              We have yet to guard our          coasts
with brighter beacons and safer lifeboats               ;  and our railways have
 yet to convey us more swiftly and safely to our home.                  But,    what
is more important       still, we have yet to discover and combat those
subtle poisons which are everywhere               assailing the seat of life,    and
hurrying thousands of their victims to the grave.
     In the completion of these great inventions and discoveries,                 we
shall then learn, what statesmen have been unable or unwilling                     to
learn, that art and science are the means by which the blessings of
religion and civilisation        are   to be sent to the distant isles of the
sea, — the several families of the earth united in one, and the               reign
of   peace and righteousness established on the earth.
    But while art and science are thus adding to our social blessings,
and are pre-eminently the instruments of peace, they have in our
day been busily and successfully-employed                 in forging the  weapons
of violence     and destruction.           Nor is this a retrograde         step in
civilisation.     By increasing the dangers,           we   diminish the  chances,
of war.     In perfecting      the machinery       of Death,   we eventually add
security to Life.        War may become             so  disastrous   in its  conse
quences, so indiscriminate in its slaughter,               and so appalling in its
carnage, that    it will cease to be the arena        of the heroic virtues    ; and
this bloody scourge of humanity — the master crime of nations-
will   be crushed     by the genius        of art, and perish by the      weapons
itself has used.

 regret   to say that during the year which is about to close, our
 losses have been     unusually severe, not only when reckoned numeri
 cally, but when measured by the talent and reputation of the col
 leagues we have lost.
    Of our foreign Honorary Fellows we have lost two, Frederick
George    William Struve of Pulkowa, and Professor Encke of Berlin.
Of our Honorary Home Fellows we have lost three — Sir John
Richardson,       Sir William Jackson Hooker, and Sir William Rowan
Hamilton.         Of our Ordinary Fellows we have lost seven : — Mr
James Skene of Rubislaw; Professor Aytoun ; Sir John Maxwell of
Pollock, Bart. ; Sir William A. Maxwell of Calderwood, Bart. ; Dr
Maclagan ; Sheriff Gordon ; and Dr Thomas Herbert Barker, Bed
ford. Two Fellows of the Society have resigned — Mr G. R. Mait-
land, and the Rev. Dr Nisbet.             The names of two Fellows have
been cancelled       — Mr A. Mackenzie Edwards, and Mr Alfred
Wanklyn.          Two of the Fellows in our last list should have been
transferred      to the list of British      Honorary Fellows — Dr Thomas
Graham, Master of the        Mint  ;  and Sir    John F. W. Herschel.
   The following seven new Fellows have been elected : — Messrs
Alfred R. Catton, Charles Jenner, Charles Lawson, junr., Dr John
Moir, James Powrie, Rev. Francis Redford, and James Stevenson.
    Upon our roll for 1864 we had Ordinary Fellows,                   .     279

    In  proceeding to give a brief, but necessarily imperfect account
of the colleagues we have lost,       I must    plead the difficulty of obtain
ing the requisite      information   so soon after    their decease.    On the
present    occasion, the duty is one of delicacy also, as       I have been in
personal communication        with all of them but one, and with some
in relations of a warmer kind.         It  is likewise one of some solemnity
when     discharged     by one who, with a single exception,          is senior

     Frederick George William Strute,             a distinguished   astronomer,
 was born at Altona, on the 15th         April 1793, and was the fourth       son
 of Dr Jacob Struve, Director of the Gymnasium in that city. At
 the University of Dorpat, which he entered in 1808, and where his
 elder brother was classical lecturer, he took the degree of Doctor of
 Philosophy in 1813, and in the following year he was appointed
 Assistant at the Observatory, and Extraordinary Professor of Astro
 nomy.      In   1820, he was chosen Director of the Observatory,              an
 office which he held     till 1839, when he was called to the         direction
 of the great observatory which the Emperor of Kussia had                  estab
lished at Pulkowa, and furnished with the finest instruments.
    Between 1816 and 1819, he executed the trigonometrical survey
of Livonia.       Between     1822 and 1827, he measured a part of the
meridian in the Baltic provinces; and in 1831 he published an
account of his operations.         In 1828 he connected this survey with
that of General Tenner        ; and in 1851 he completed the measure of
the Russo-Scandinavian arc of the meridian between Ismael, at the
mouth of the Danube, in 45° 20' and Fuglenaes in 70° 40' of north
latitude, — an arc of    25° 20', the largest that ever has been measured.
    Among the other scientific expeditions undertaken by M. Struve,
was the levelling of the country between the Black Sea and the
Caspian      Sea, the determination        of the geographical      position of
several points in Siberia, in the Trans-Caucasian provinces and in
Asiatic Turkey, and the observation of the great eclipses of 1842 and
1851. The results of these different expeditions have been pub
lished in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences of St Petersburg.
    During the fifty years spent by M. Struve in the observatories of
Dorpat and Pulkowa, he made many valuable observations on double
and multiple stars ; on the parallax of the stars, on their distribution
in   space ;  on the Milky Way     ; and on the motion of the solar system.
His observations at Dorpat between 1837 and 1839 have                       been
published in eight volumes.        Those on Double Stars are contained in
treatises published in 1820, 1827, 1830, 1837, and 1852; and those
on the Parallax        of the Fixed Stars, on the Milky Way,             and on
the Motion of the Solar System in Space, were published in 1847,
in    a very    interesting volume,        entitled "Etudes d'Astronomie
Stellaire."     Adopting 0"-209     as the  parallax of stars of the first mag
nitude, he found that the annual velocity of the solar system round

 a point in the constellation    Hercules is 33 millions of geographical
 miles, and   that we may wager 400,000 to         1 that such a motion
exists.
   Frederick     Struve   was an ordinary Counsellor of State, a Com
mander     of the Legion of Honour, and      a Corresponding    Member of
the  Imperial Institute of France.        He died at St Petersburg, after
a short   illness, on the 23d November 1864, in the 72d year of his
age,  and was succeeded in the Direction of the Observatory              of
Pulkowa by his distinguished son, Otto       William Struve, well known
to the scientific   world by his writings and his astronomical     labours.
   Jobn Francis Encke, a distinguished astronomer, was born at
Hamburg on the 23d September 1791.                 His father, who was
minister of the church of St James', in that city, sent him to the
University     of Gottingen, where he studied under the celebrated
Gauss, who was then         Professor of Mathematics,    and Director of
the Observatory.       In 1813 he was enrolled for active service in
the  military force raised by the Hanseatic towns, and afterwards
rose to the rank of lieutenant of artillery in the Prussian service.
In this capacity his acquirements became known to Baron Linde-
nau, the Director of the Observatory           of Seeberg, near Gotha.
Having become Minister of State in 1817, the Baron             gave young
Encke the entire charge of the Observatory, which he conducted
so  ably that he was made      Joint-Director in 1829.     Soon after this
he was called to    Berlin, where he was appointed   Director of the Royal
Observatory, and became Secretary to the Academy of Sciences.
   During his occupation of these two observatories Encke made
many valuable contributions to astronomy.           Among the most im
portant were his determination       of the orbit of the famous comet of
 1680,  of the distance of the earth from the sun, and of the orbit
of the comet discovered by Pons in 1818 ; for the first of which he
obtained    the prize of Cotta, adjudged to him by Gauss and Olbers.
His solution of the problem of the Earth's Distance         from the Sun,
by the aid    of the Transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769, was pub
lished in two memoirs, entitled      La  Distance du Soleil.    In  several
papers   in the Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin, between 1829
and   1851, he demonstrated the periodicity of Pons' comet, which
be   proved to be identical with       the  comets   of 1786, 1795, and

 470               Proceedings    of the Koyal     Society
 1805.    This interesting body, now known as Encke'a Comet,
 moves in an elliptical orbit within that of Jupiter, and completes
 its revolution   in three years and four mouths.           Having   found
 that from 1786 to 1795 the time of its revolution         had diminished
 from 1208 11 days to 1207 88, and between 1795 and 1805 from
 1207 88 to 1207'42 days, he concluded that the diminution was         pro
duced by the action       of Jupiter  ; but upon using a more correct
value of the mass of that planet, he found that the difference          be
tween    the observed and computed        places of the comet could       be
accounted     for only on the hypothesis of a resisting medium— a
doctrine which, in its astronomical          relations, must remain in
abeyance, till it is exhibited in the motions of other celestial
bodies.
    Upon his removal to Berlin, Encke became editor of the          Astro-
nomische8   Jahrbuch,   which contains many of his papers on physical
astronomy.      He visited Scotland in 1839, and took an active part
in the proceedings of the British Association which met at Glas
gow.    He was a member of many foreign academies, and a Cor
responding Member of the Imperial Institute of France.             He  died
at Berlin in 1865, in the seventy-fifth year of his age.
    Sir John Richardson, the distinguished Arctio traveller             and
navigator, was born at Dumfries in 1787, and was educated at             the
grammar school of that town.       He entered the University of Edin
burgh in 1801, with the view of following the medical profession.
After obtaining the diploma of the Royal College of Surgeons, he was
appointed    assistant-surgeon   to the Nymphe, one of        Sir Richard
Keats' squadron, which accompanied Lord Gambier to the          bombard
ment of Copenhagen.        In  1807 the Nymphe was employed in          the
blockade   of the Tagus;      and  Mr Richardson       was present,    as a
volunteer, in two unsuccessful attempts to cut out vessels anchored
higher up the river.    After serving in different ships in various parts
of the world, he returned to Edinburgh to pursue his medical studies;
and in 1817 he took the degree of doctor of medicine.             In 1819
he was appointed     surgeon and naturalist to the expedition       under
Lieutenant Franklin, which was sent to survey the northern           coast
of North America. He returned to England in 1822, and in              1824
he was appointed     surgeon to the royal marines at Chatham.            In

the years       1825-6-7,   Dr Richardson surveyed with great ability
the sea-coast      between the Mackenzie and the Coppermine          Rivers  ;
and    after his rotum, he resumed          and continued     his duties    at
Chatham       till 1838, when he was promoted to the rank of physician
to  Haslar Hospital, and Inspector of Naval Hospitals and Fleets —
a  situation which gave him leisure to pursue the studies to which
he had      been so long devoted.        His services, however, were too
valuable     to be dispensed with ; and though now in the sixtieth
year   of his age, he set out with Dr Rae, in 1848, in search of Sir
John Franklin and his party.           After encountering perils both on
land and sea, and       surmounting difficulties of no ordinary kind, he
returned     to England in 1849, and continued for six years in the
charge     of Haslar Hospital. In 1855 he retired from the public
service,   to which he had devoted himself for nearly half a century,
and settled      at Lancrigg, in Westmoreland, where he died on the
5th   January 1865, in the seventy-eighth year of his age.
    Sir John received the honour of knighthood in 1846, and was
afterwards made a Companion            of the Bath.    He  was   a Fellow of
 the   Royal, Linnean, and Geological Societies, and a member of
 various philosophical societies, both in this country and the Con
 tinent.
    Sir  John is the author of the Fauna Borealis Americana, and of
 works on almost every branch         of natural history, several of which
 appeared as appendices to the voyages         of different Arctic naviga
 tors.    He contributed several articles       to the   "British Encyclo-
 pasdia,"    and was one of the editors of the
                                                     " Museum of Natural
 History."
    Sir  William Jackson Hooker, a distinguished botanist,          was born
 at  Norwich on the 6th of      July   1785, and received his early educa
 tion at the     High School of that city.    His father, who was   a man   of
 literary tastes, possessed a collection of rare and curious plants     ;  and
 it was no doubt from this circumstance        that he was led to the early
 study    of botany.     Having inherited from his godfather, William
 Jackson, Esq., a considerable landed property, he resolved to devote
 himself to scientific pursuits     ; but in order to improve his lands, he
 spent some      time in the study of agriculture at Starston in Norfolk.

472               Proceedings     of the Royal    Society
Here, however, he devoted most of his time to the study of         natural
history, making    a fine collection   of the birds and insects of Nor
folk.    Having   discovered   a new    and   curious   British moss, the
Buxbaumia aphylla, he took it to Sir James Edward Smith,               aQd
was encouraged by that eminent botanist to pursue the study which
he had so successfully     begun.    In   1806, when he came into pos
session of his fortune,    he made extensive       botanical tours in  the
remotest parts of Scotland     in company with Dawson Turner, Esq.,
whose eldest daughter he married in 1815. By the advice of Sir
Joseph Banks, with whom he became acquainted during his resi
dence in London, he visited Iceland in 1809, and made large col
lections  there in every department       of natural history.   The ship,
however, in which he returned was burned          at sea, and he himself
miraculously escaped by the help of another vessel, with the loss
of all his manuscripts, drawings, and specimens.           His account of
this journey, drawn up from memory, was published in 1811 under
the title of " Recollections of Iceland," the first of a series of
works which raised him to a high place in the scientific world.
   In  1810-11 he made great preparations       to accompany Sir Robert
Brownrigg, who was going out           as  governor   to Ceylon, but the
sanguinary disturbances which took place in that island         prevented
him from visiting it.
   In  1814 he made a botanical tour of nine months in France,
Switzerland, and the North of Italy, and thus became acquainted
with many of the most distinguished botanists in Europe. In 1812
he began his first botanical work, on the British Jungermanniao,
which    was  completed   in 1816.     This work was followed       by his
Muscologia    Britannica   and his Musci Exotici, the first of which
was published in conjunction with       Dr Taylor in 1817.
   While engaged in these and other works, he found it necessary         to
look out for some permanent employment. He had sold his landed
property in 1811, and vested the proceeds in different securities,
which had    so  rapidly deteriorated, that in 1820, on the advice of
Sir Joseph Banks, he accepted of the vacant Professorship of
Botany in the University of Glasgow, which was then worth little
more than L.100 a year, but which afterwards             rose to upwards
of L.800.
   During the twenty years he resided in Glasgow he published           his

Flora Scolica,      which appeared in 1821 ; his Flora Exotica, in
1823-27;       his Icones Filicum, in conjunction with Dr Greville;
and in 1839      the first edition of his British Flora, in the 12th edi
tion of which he was assisted -by Professor Walker Arnott.
    In 1836 he received the honour of knighthood, and through the
influence of Earl Russell he was appointed, in 1841, Director of
the   Royal Gardens at Kew, a situation which he held during the
rest of his life.      In thiB favoured position he improved the arrange
ments    of the Gardens, and prevailed upon Government to build             a
noble   palm-house and extensive          conservatories, and he founded a
library and     botanical   museum, in which his noble herbarium,        the
largest   in Britain, is deposited.
    The works of Sir William Hooker, comprising upwards of fifty
volumes of descriptive botany, illustrated chiefly by drawings from
bis   own exquisite        pencil,  are too numerous     to be mentioned   in
 detail in a brief notice of his life.
    Sir William was       a Knight of the Hanoverian Order and        a Che
 valier of the Legion of Honour, and he received from Oxford the
 degree    of D.C.L., and from Glasgow that of LL.D. He was a
 Fellow of the Royal, Linnean, Antiquarian, and other English
 Societies, and a Corresponding Member of the Imperial Institute
 of France, and of all the principal Academies in Europe and
 America.
     He died at Kew on the 12th of August 1865, in the 80th year
 of his age, and     is succeeded in the direction of the Royal Gardens
 by his distinguished son, Dr Joseph Dalton Hooker.
     Our  list of British Honorary Fellows has sustained an irreparable
 loss by   the recent death of Sir      William Rowan Hamilton,       one of
 the greatest mathematicians         that have ever lived.
     At an early age he displayed uncommon talents, especially in
 the study     of languages.       He is said to have acquired nearly a
 dozen different      languages    when   only thirteen years old. In his
 fifteenth year he had already mastered all the branches of mathe
  matics usually taught in a university ; and in his twenty-second
  year, while but an undergraduate of Trinity College, Dublin, was
  appointed Andrews' Professor of Astronomy, and Astronomer-
  Boyal for Ireland, as successor to       Dr Brinkley, who had been one
     vol.  t.                                                    3  Q

of the first to recognise his wonderful mathematical                 powers, and to
guide his early investigations.
     These early investigations,       which had reference chiefly to           Geo
metrical Optics, were gradually developed       into an elaborate "         Theory
of Systems of Rays," which was communicated to the Royal Irish
Academy in 1828. In the third supplement to this essay, he pre
dicted from theory the existence of the two species of Conical Ref rac-
tion, the experimental verification of which has given               so much addi
tional probability to the hypothesis of luminiferous undulations.
   His next great papers were entitled " On a General Method in
Dynamics," and appeared in the Philosophical Transactions in
1833-34.  In these he developed the principle of Varying Action,
the discovery of which constitutes one of the most important steps
which dynamical science has yet made.                    In   these investigations,
both optical and dynamical, the novel and remarkable feature is the
discovery of the existence        of   a    single function (adapted to         each
particular problem), from which, if known, the complete solution
of the problem is to be found by differentiation alone. These papers
soon gave him a European          fame, and procured for him the honorary
diploma of all the most important scientific societies abroad, as well
as at home.       Though much has been done, especially by Jacobi,                  in
extension of Hamilton's results, it has been almost entirely confined
to their analytical aspect;        the physical discoveries            which    must
abundantly flow from them have, as yet, been barely sought for.
   But perhaps Hamilton was most widely known by his splendid
invention of " Quaternions." A profound general principle in optics
or dynamics is heard of only by the few who can understand it;
but a new mathematical          method      is,   at least in its elements,    acces
sible to all.Little has yet been done to disseminate elementary
knowledge of this important Calculus. Hamilton's
                                                    " Lectures on
Quaternions" (1853)      is   adapted only to       a   high class of readers  ;   but
it   is   to be hoped that his posthumous work, to which he devoted the
last six years of his life, and which (under the title of " Elements
of Quaternions")       announced for speedy publication, will put
                       is
within the reach of the intelligent beginner branch of mathematics
                                                         a
which for simplicity of conception, symmetry, variety of expres
sion, and almost irresistible power, may well challenge comparison
with any yet devised.

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1865-66.                               475
     Hamilton's       other   numerous       publications,    chiefly in scientific
journals, such as        the " Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy,"
the   "Philosophical Magazine," &c.,             are devoted to the most varied
subjects.
                 " Algebra    as the Science     of Pure Time," " Abel's argu
ment as      to the impossibility of solving the general equation of the
fifth degree,"        " Definite      Integrals,"     " Fluctuating      Functions,"
"Icosian Calculus," &c., may be taken as examples.                       But, besides
all this, he is understood to have left an immense store of manu
script    investigations on subjects of the greatest importance, from
which,      it is to be hoped, copious selections will be published.
Hamilton was scrupulous, almost to excess, as to the exactness and
symmetry        of everything he published         ;  and  it may   be that, among
the investigations        which he did not consider properly polished for
the press, there        are gems of even greater value than those which
have seen       the light.
    In  a  life of but sixty years such         a mass   of original work has not
often been accomplished             ;  but when      we consider     that Hamilton
retained to the last his love          for languages (especially Persian), that
he was no mean poet, that he was one of the most copious of cor
respondents, and that he willingly entered into the minutest
details    when applied         to for explanations        on subjects     connected
with    his writings, we wonder              how he found        time for       a mere
fraction of what he has done.
   Sir  John Herschel once wrote thus : — " Here, whole branches of
continental discovery are unstudied, and, indeed, almost unknown
even by name.            It is vain to conceal the melancholy            truth.      We
are   fast dropping behind.             In  mathematics      we have long since
drawn the        rein and given over         a hopeless race,     &c."     Hamilton,
while second to none, was one              of the earliest of that brilliant array
of mathematicians who, since Herschel wrote, have removed this
stigma, and well-nigh              reversed the terms of his statement.
Another was the late Professor               Boole, who, though not           a  Fellow
of this Society, claims notice in this address as having received our
highest honour, the          Keith Medal.        Their death has made          a gap  in
the ranks       of British science which will not soon          be  filled  ;   and our
 sorrow is      but increased by the recollection that they have been
 removed       in the full vigour of their intellect, and when their
 passion    for work    was,   if possible, stronger than ever.

    Dr David Maclaoan       was born    in Edinburgh in February         1785.
 After receiving    his classical   education    at the    High   School,   he
 entered the University as a student of medicine, and was appren
 ticed to  Mr Andrew Wood, one of the principal surgeons in                the
 city.   In  1804 he took     his surgeon's diploma, and in          1805 his
 degree of M.D.,   and  he prepared himself for the medical         service of
 the army by studying at St George's          Hospital, and becoming in
 1807 a Member       of the Royal College of Surgeons in England.
 Attached to the 91st regiment, he accompanied it to Walcheren,
 where he had the good fortune       to escape   the epidemic which       deci
 mated the flower of the British        army.    In  1811, after his return
 to England, he was under orders for Canada, when he received
 the appointment     of staff-surgeon    to the 9th Portuguese        brigade,
 a part of the 4th division, which, under the Duke of Wellington,
 was investing the fortress of Badajos.         He accordingly     sailed for
 Lisbon in November        1811, and was present at the storming of
 Badajos, and at the subsequent battles of Salamanca, Vittoria, the
 Pyrenees, the Nivelle, and the Nive, receiving for these services
the    Peninsular   medal, with     six clasps.     The professional skill
 which he exhibited on these occasions, and his active zeal for the
 recovery   of the wounded,     were frequently acknowledged           by his
 military superiors, and led to his appointment         as  physician to    the
forces.
    In  1816 DrMaclagan      quitted the army on half-pay;       and having
been admitted a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, he settled
in his native city, when his professional skill soon obtained for him
an extensive    practice.   In   1826 he was elected President of the
Royal College of Surgeons, and of the Royal College of Physicians
in 1856.      He presided also over the Medico-Chirurgical Society,
and took an active and intelligent part in all our literary, scientific,
and philanthropic institutions.        In  the cause of medical      missions
he took     an early   and   zealous   part;   and   the   friends of    every
religious movement could always count upon his active and                gene
rous support.
    To his professional accomplishments,      Dr Maclagan added        a taste
for the fine arts, and he was intimately acquainted with the              emi
nent artists who in his time adorned our metropolis.
    Amid the distractions of his professional life, which lasted          more

   than    half  a century,     he found leisure     to study the great social
   questions    of the day, and was an ardent promoter of Parliamentary
   and   burgh reform, free trade, Catholic emancipation, the education
   of the people, and the abolition       of slavery.   But while he thus took
  a zealous     part in every question, and in every institution of secular
  interest,    he had ever in his view the higher destinies                of man.
  He was an exemplary member of the Presbyterian Church, and a
  true believer      in those great truths which the wisdom of this world
  is unable      to comprehend.          Without any marked disease, but
  weakened       gradually with     age,  this truly Christian physician and
 philanthropist        expired on the 6th     June 1865, in the midst of his
 family, lamented          by a widow and seven sons, some of whom have
 obtained distinction in the service of their country.
      Sir  John Maxwell          of Pollock succeeded his father          as  ninth
 baronet     in 1844, and belonged to the twenty-ninth generation of his
 family.       He was born in 1791, and received his early education,
 partly in Scotland, under the Rev. Dr MacLetchie of Mearns, and
 partly in England, at Market-Raisin, and subsequently at Westmin
 ster     School.      In   1809 he entered     Christ Church, Oxford,         as a
 gentleman commoner, and graduated in that University.                    In   1812
 he attended several classes        in the University of Edinburgh        ;  and in
 the    following year, at the age of twenty-two, he was appointed
lieutenant-colonel of the Renfrew militia — an office which he very
soon resigned,        in consequence of the Government refusing to send
relief to   the starving operatives in Paisley. In 1813, 1814, and 1815,
 he made the tour         of Europe, visiting part of Africa and Asia, accom
panied by Mr John Bramsen, an ex-officer of the Prussian service,
and afterwards Professor of German in the University of Oxford. A
journal of his travels is preserved at Pollock            ;  but a fuller Account
of them was published in 1818 by Professor Bramsen.
     In   1818,   Mr Maxwell      was  elected  M.P. for the county of Ren
frew, and represented that          county in three successive Parliaments.
In    1831    he contested the county of Lanark with the brother of
Lord Douglas        ;  but though defeated on that oocasion, he was elected
for that county         in 1832, after the passing of the Keform Bill, and
again     in 1835.       As a Member of Parliament, he took an active part
in many of the leading measures of the day              ;   and on several occa

 478               Proceedings     of the Royal  Society
 sions when he spoke in the House of Commons, he was listened
 to with attention and respect.
     In 1859, when the Prince of Wales, on the 15th August, visited
 for the first time his ancient barony of Renfrew — the cradle of his
 Stuart ancestors in Scotland — he was hospitably received at Pollock
 House.
     Sir John Maxwell       was liberal in his politics, and    published
 several pamphlets      on Parliamentary reform,    and the other great
 questions which then agitated the country.
     In  1839, he married     Lady Matilda Bruce, second daughter        of
 Thomas    Earl of Elgin and Kincardine. She died on the     31st August
 1857, without issue. Sir John died on the 6th of June       1865, in the
 seventy-fifth year of his age, and was succeeded in his       estates by
 his nephew, William Stirling, Esq. of Keir.
    Sir  William Alexander Maxwell of           Calderwood,    descended
from    the  oldest   branch    of the Maxwells   of Pollock,    and   the
seventh baronet, was born on the 30th         April 1793.    He   entered
the army at an early age, and held a commission            in the   1st or
Royal Dragoon Guards.           Upon succeeding to his father in 1837,
he retired from the service with the rank of colonel.         In 1847 he
married    the fifth daughter     of Walter Logan, Esq. of Eingalton.
 He died on the 4th of April 1865, in the seventy-fifth year of his
age, and was succeeded by his brother,       Mr Hugh Bates Maxwell,
who had been called to the Scotch bar in 1818.
    James Skene of Rubislaw, was born on the 7th March               1775.
His father died in the following year, leaving a widow and a family
of seven children. In 1783, Mrs Skene removed to Edinburgh for
their education,     and James, who was then       the second son and
youngest child, was placed at the        High School  ; and was the last
survivor of   a host  of distinguished men who were his class-fellows.
   In   1791, after he had left the   High School, he succeeded     to the
family-estate of Rubislaw, by the death of his elder brother;          and
at the age of twenty-one,      he was sent to Germany to complete his
studies.    After acquiring    a knowledge  of the French and    German
languages he returned to Edinburgh, and was admitted to the Scotch
bar in 1797.      Here he formed      an acquaintance   with Sir Walter

                    of Edinburgh,      Session 1865-66.                      479
 Scott, which     ripened    into  a close and     life-long friendship.      Mr
 Skene had     early shown a love of art, and a singular talent for
 drawing,  to which Sir Walter alludes in the introduction to the 4th
 canto of  Marmion, which is dedicated to Mr Skene.
                        " As thou with pencil, I with pen,
                          The features traced of hill and glen."
   In 1797 Mr Skene         was appointed cornet      of the Edinburgh Light
Horse, one    of the earliest regiments of volunteers, which was organ
ised  mainly by the efforts of Sir Walter Scott. After walking the
Parliament House for a few years,          Mr Skene revisited the continent
in 1802, and     travelled over the greater part of Europe during the
next   few years.      In this journey he became acquainted with Mr
Greenough, President of the Geological Society                  of London, and
travelled for some time with that distinguished geologist.                     He
thus acquired       a taste   for geology, and was afterwards           elected a
member     of the Geological Society.
   In 1806 Mr Skene married Jane, daughter of Sir William Forbes
of Pitsligo, Bart., and settled on a small property he possessed                in
Kincardineshire,      where he spent the next eight years of his life.
   In 1816 Mr Skene returned to Edinburgh, for the education of
his children,     when     he joined the different       literary and scientific
societies,   which at that time were not in           a very   flourishing state.
He became a member of the Royal Society in 1817, and as Curator
of their Library and Museum,            an office which he held for many
years, he    did eminent service to that important department of the
Society.     He was also a member of the Antiquarian Society, and
 took an active part      in its reform and restoration.
    During his residence         in Edinburgh       Mr Skene explored         and
sketched the various buildings in the Old Town that were remark
able for    their antiquity or historical interest, and he has left a
 valuable collection of these sketches, which we trust may be given
 to the  public.
    Mr Skene held for many years the office of Secretary to the
 Board   of Trustees and Manufactures, and in this capacity he did
 much   for the promotion of the fine arts in Scotland.
    In 1838, when the health of some of his family required             a warmer
climate, he went to Greece, and settled in the vicinity of Athens.

480                Proceedings    of  the Royal Society
In   an elegant villa, built by himself, he spent eight years       ;  and
he has left behind him     a series  of beautiful water-colour drawings,
upwards of 500 in number, of the scenery and antiquities of that
interesting country.
   On his return to England in 1844, he took up his residence in
Leamington.        He afterwards went to Oxford, and resided in a
curious old mansion, called Frewen        Hall, where he enjoyed the  best
literary society in that seat of learning. After a residence there
of nearly fifteen years, he died on the 27th of November 1864, in
the 90th year of his age.
   Mr    Skene was a man of very elegant tastes and numerous accom
plishments.       He had a great general knowledge     of science  as well
as  of literature, and spoke with fluency French, German, and Italian.
He was, as Sir Walter Scott said, " the first amateur draughts
man in Scotland," and was the author of two volumes of Illustra
tions of the Waverley       Novels.     But though he used his pencil
more than his pen, yet he made several contributions to the
Transactions of the Societies to which he belonged, and was the
author of the excellent     article on painting in the Edinburgh       En
cyclopaedia.
   John Thomson Gordon was the only           son of Dr John Gordon, —
a  distinguished teacher of anatomy in this city, and author of
several valuable treatises on anatomy and physiology,       — and of Miss  ,
Rutherfurd, sister of the late eminent lawyer and judge Lord
Rutherfurd. He was born in Edinburgh, on the 19th March 1813 ;
and, after gaining distinction as a classical       scholar  at the Edin
burgh Academy and at this University, he prosecuted with great
zeal and success the study of the modern languages at Aschaffen-
burg,    in Bavaria.    He  was   called to the bar in     1835, and was
remarkable among his compeers for the extent of his scholarship,
the richness of his fancy, and the natural eloquence of which he
was possessed,     and these, from the geniality of his nature,       were
always at the disposal of his friends and the public.
   In    1837  Mr Gordon married the second daughter of Professor
Wilson, and has left five sons and one daughter.
   He was appointed Sheriff of Aberdeenshire in 1847, and of Mid-
Lothian in 1848, an office which he held, and the duties of which

   be discharged     with great ability, till his death, which took place
  suddenly,    at  Caen in Normandy, on 22d September 1865.
     Thomas     Herbert Barker,      a distinguished member of the British
  Medical Association,      was born in 1814.    He received his professional
  education at Queen's       College, Birmingham, and at University Col
  lege, London.       He was licensed by the Apothecary's Company in
  1827, and     became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in
  1842, and      a  Fellow of the     same   body in 1851.      Although he
 obtained great      distinction in the different    departments of his pro
 fession, yet his reputation        mainly rests upon his investigation     of
 the cause     of epidemic and endemic diseases.
     In 1858, the Fothergill Gold Medal was awarded to him for his
 essay on     Malaria and Miasmata, which        was published  in 1862, and
 in the course of last summer he received from the British Medical
 Association the Hastings Gold Medal for his essay on Deodorisation
 and Disinfection.         Dr Barker is also the author of   a valuable work
           "
 on the       Hygienic Management of Infants and Children," and of
 various   articles in the medical journals.        He died at Bedford of a
 severe attack     of typhoid fever on the 24th October 1865.
     William Edmonstoune Aytoun             was  born in   June 1813.     His
father, who was an eminent          writer to the Signet, died when his son
was   comparatively young.        After receiving his elementary education
at the   Edinburgh Academy, he went through the usual curriculum
of study at the       University of Edinburgh, which he was destined
afterwards      to adorn.    At the end of his course he went to Germany,
where he acquired         that knowledge of its literature which is so con
spicuous     in his writings.     On his return to Scotland he passed as a
writer to the Signet, but disliking the profession, he was called to the
Scottish Bar in 1840, and practised for some time in criminal cases
on the    western circuit.      His time, however, was devoted principally
to literature, and,      with some exceptions, his earliest productions
were contributed         to Tait's Magazine, where, in conjunction with
his friend      Mr Theodore       Martin,   he began his celebrated      Bon-
Gualtier Ballads, which have gone through              many editions.      In
1832 Mr Aytoun published his first separate work entitled
                                                                    " Poland,
Homer, and other Poems."            In 1833 he made the first contributions
    vol. v.                                                        3 R

482               Proceedings       of the Royal Society
to Blackwood's    Magazine, and from that time to his             death   they
amounted to more than a hundred and twenty.              In  1843 he contri
buted to that   Journal the two beautiful poems entitled the " Burial
 March of Dundee," and       "   Charles   Edward at Versailles,"      and in
 1845, his celebrated satire on railway speculation,         entitled
                                                                        " How
 we got up the Glenmutchkin."           His " Life and Times of Richard
 III." appeared in 1840, and in 1849 his most popular work, "The
 Lays of the Scottish     Cavaliers," the most interesting of which,
" Edinburgh after Flodden," had          appeared^  in Blackwood's      Maga
 zine for the preceding   3rear.
    In 1845 he succeeded Professor Spalding as Professor of Rhetoric
and English Literature in the University.            To the duties of this
office be devoted himself with great energy and success, raising his
class from thirty to upwards of one hundred and fifty students.
    In  1849, Professor Aytoun married          the youngest    daughter      of
Professor Wilson, in the society of whom            ten years of domestic
happiness passed rapidly away.
    In 1852 he was appointed Sheriff of Orkney and Shetland, spend
ing in these islands several months in the year, and discharging            the
duties of his office with much assiduity and success.
    In 1854 he published " Firmilian — a Spasmodic Tragedy;"                  in
1856, "Bothwell— a Poem;" in 1858,
                                               " the Ballads of Scotland ;"
and in 1861, a novel, entitled " Norman Sinclair."                The last of
his separate works was the           " Nuptial    Ode on the Marriage of
H. R. H. the Prince of Wales."
    In 1863 Professor Ay toun married Miss Kinnear — a happy union
which he was destined not long to enjoy.             His health had, in the
following winter, begun to fail, and unfitness for intellectual pnrsnits
began to indicate the commencement of some serious malady.                   In
the beginning of last   June     he went to  Blackhills, near Elgin, in     the
 hope of recovering   his strength       while enjoying the hill     and field
sports of that delightful neighbourhood.           This hope, however,     was
fallacious.    Neither the salubrity of the climate, nor the bracing
exercise of the fields, nor the skill of his physician, could arrest
the progress of that fatal disease which was rapidly invading               the
seat of life.   He sank gradually under its influence, and in the full
Ijossession of his faculties, and he died, as a Christian should die,
on the 4th    August 1865, in the 53d year of his       age.

   Among the eminent men whose loss this Society and the Univer
sity have had recently to deplore, Professor Aytoun holds a distin
 guished place.    As  a poet of high talent and varied acquirements,
distinguished alike by his genial humour, and by the force and
purity of his satire, he will be long and warmly admired, but more
warmly still by those who weep over the memories of that unfor
tunate dynasty which he has      so ably and   loyally immortalised.      As
an able and assiduous judge, he       will  be  long and kindly remem
bered by the islanders among whom he annually laboured            ;  and as
a professor in the University which he adorned, his pupils          will not
soon forget his earnest sympathy       with their studies, nor his col
leagues    his devotion  to the interests of the University, and the
happy hours which they spent in his society.

       Sir DAVID BREWSTER, President, in the Chair.
At the request of the Council, Professor William Thomson
  of Glasgow delivered the following Address on the Forces
  concerned          in the Laying and Lifting of Deep-Sea Cahles.
The forces concerned in the laying and                 lifting of   deep   submarine
cables attracted much            public attention in the years 1857-58.
  An experimental             trip to the Bay of Biscay in May 1858, proved
the possibility, not only of safely laying such a rope as the old
Atlantic cable in very deep water, but of lifting it from the bottom
without fracture.    The speaker had witnessed the almost incredible
feat of lifting up a considerable length of that slight and seemingly
fragile thread from a depth of nearly 2J nautical miles.*         The
cable had       actually brought with it safely to the surface, from the
bottom,        a splice with a large weighted frame attached to        to       it,
prevent       untwisting between the two ships, from which two portions
of cable      with opposite twists had been laid. The actual laying of
the cable        a   few months        later, from mid ocean to Valencia on

mile) but the nautical mile, or the length                                in mean

&c,    it   may be taken as 6000 feet, or 1000 fathoms.

 one side, and   Trinity Bay, Newfoundland, on the other,               regarded
 merely as a mechanical achievement, took by surprise some of                 the
 most celebrated     engineers of the day, who had not concealed their
 opinion, that the Atlantic Telegraph         Cumpany had undertaken            an
 impossible    problem.    As   a mechanical      achievement    it   was com
 pletely successful   ; and the electric    failure, after several      hundred
 messages   (comprising    upwards of 4359 words) had been transmitted
 between Valencia and Newfoundland, was owing to electric faults
 existing in the cable before it went to sea. Such faults cannot
 escape detection, in the course of the manufacture, under the
 improved electric testing since brought into practice, and the            causes
 which led to the failure of the first Atlantic cable no longer exist
 as dangers   in submarine telegraphic enterprise.        But the possibility
 of damage being done to the insulation of the electric conductor
 before it leaves the ship (illustrated by the occurrences which led
to the temporary loss of the 1865 cable), implies a danger which
can only be thoroughly guarded against              by being   ready at any
moment to back the ship and check the egress of the cable,                    and
to hold on for some time, or to haul back some length according                  to
the results of electric testing.
   The forces concerned in these operations, and the mechanical
arrangements by which they are applied and directed, constitute
one chief part of the present address       ;  the remainder is devoted          to
explanations    as to the problem    of lifting the west end of        the 1200
miles of cable laid last summer, from Valencia westwards, and now
lying in perfect electric condition (in the very safest place in           which
a submarine cable can be kept), and ready to do its work, as soon                as
it is connected with Newfoundland, by the 600 miles required                     to
complete the line.
            Forces concerned    in the Submergence     of a Cable.
   In  a paper published     in the " Engineer"       Journal in      1857, the
speaker had given the differential equations of the catenary formed
by a submarine cable between the ship and the bottom, during                   the
submergence, under the influence of gravity and fluid friction                and
pressure  ; and he had pointed out that the curve becomes a straight
line in the  case  of  no tension at the bottom.       As this is   always the

                     of Edinburgh,     Session 1865-66.                       497
 case iu   deep-sea cable laying, he made no farther         reference to the
 general problem      in the present address.
    When a cable is laid at uniform speed, on a level bottom, quite
 straight,   but without tension,     it forms an inclined straight line,
from the     point where it enters the water, to the bottom, and each
point of it clearly moves uniformly in a straight line towards the
position on the bottom that it ultimately occupies.*                That is to
say, each    particle of the cable moves uniformly along the             base    of
an isosceles    triangle, of which the two equal sides        are the   inclined
portion    of the cable between it and the bottom, and the line along
the   bottom which this portion of the cable covers when laid. When
the   cable is paid out from the ship at a rate exceeding          that of the
ship's   progress,    the velocity   and direction of the motion of any
particle   of it through the water      are to be found      by compounding
a  velocity along the inclined side, equal to this excess, with the
velocity already determined, along the base         of the isosceles triangle.
   The     angle   between the     equal sides of the      isosceles   triangle,
that is to say, the     inclination which the cable takes in the water,
is determined by the condition,         that the transverse component of
the cable's weight in water is equal to the transverse component of
the resistance      of the water to its motion.         Its tension where it
enters    the water is equal to the longitudinal component                  of the
weight     (or, which is the same,       the whole     weight of    a length     of
cable    hanging vertically       down    to the bottom),      diminished by
the    longitudinal component of the fluid resistance. In the laying
of   the Atlantic cable, when the depth was two miles, the rate of
the ship    six miles an hour, and the rate of paying out of the cable
seven     miles an hour, the resistance to the egress of the cable,
accurately measured by a dynamometer,            was only 14 cwt.          But it
must have been        as much as 28 cwt., or the weight        of two miles of
the cable    hanging vertically down in water, were it not for the fric-
tional resistance of the water against the cable slipping, as            it were,
ilown an    inclined plane from the ship to the bottom, which therefore
 must have borne the difference,       or 14 cwt.     Accurate    observations
 are   wanting    as to the angle at   which the cable entered the water;
 but from measurements        of angles at the stern of the ship, and             a

dynamical estimate (from the measured strain) of what the cur
vature must have been between the ship and the water,     find                                         I
that its inclination in the water, when the ship's speed was nearly
6£ miles per hour, must have been about 6|°, that is to say, the
incline      was      about       1   in 8J.    Thus the length of cable, from                                 the
ship to the bottom, when the water was 2 miles deep, must                                                  have
been about 17 miles.
   The whole amount (14 cwt.) of fluid resistance to the motion of
this length of cablo through                    it,
                                  therefore about -81 of
                                                      is  cwt. per                               a
mile.  The longitudinal component velocity of the cable through
the water, to which this resistance was due, may be taken, with but
very small error, as simply the excess of the speed                                        of paying           out
above the speed                  of the ship, or about           1        mile an hour.               Hence,
to haul up           a        piece of the cable vertically through the water,                                  at
the rate of  mile an hour, would require less than
                     1                                 cwt. for over                  1
coming fluid friction, per mile length of the cable, over and above
its weight in water.      Thus fluid friction, which for the laying
of   a   cable performs so valuable   part in easing the strain with
                                                       a
which     it    is   paid out, offers no serious obstruction,                         indeed, scarcely
any sensible obstruction, to the reverse process of hauling back,                                               if
done at only              1   mile an hour, or any slower speed.
     As to the transverse component                         of the fluid friction,                   it    is   to
be remarked               that, although not directly assisting                            to reduce the
egress      strain,       it    indirectly contributes           to this result            ;   for   it   is   the
transverse friction that causes the gentleness of the slope, giving
the sufficient length of 17 miles of cable slipping down through                                               the
water, on which the longitudinal friction operates, to reduce                                                  the
egress      strain        to the very safe            limit found in the recent                           expe
dition.         In estimating its amount, even                            if   the    slope          were       as
much as         1    in   5,   we should       commit only an insignificant error,                              if
we supposed               it   to be simply equal to the weight of the cable
in water, or about 14 cwt. per mile for the 1865 Atlantic cable.
The transverse component velocity to which this                                 is   due may be esti
mated with but insignificant error, by taking                                  it   as the velocity             of
a    body moving directly to the bottom in the                                      time       occupied         in
laying      a   length of cable equal to the                         17    miles of oblique line
from the ship to the bottom.                     Therefore,          it   must have been about
2   miles   in 17 - 6J =          2   61 hours, or     '8   of   a   mile per hour.              It    is   not

                     of Edinburgh,        Session 1865-66.                 499
probable    that the actual motion of the cable lengthwise             through
the water can affect      this result much.       Thus, the velocity of settling
of a horizontal piece of the cable (or velocity of sinking through
the water, with weight just borne by fluid friction) would appear
to be about -8     of   a mile   per hour.      This may   be contrasted   with
longitudinal    friction by remembering that, according to the previ
ous result, a    longitudinal motion through the water at the rate of
1  mile per hour is resisted by only          ^th of the weight of the por
tion of cable so moving.
    These conclusions      justify remarkably the choice that was made
of materials and dimensions for the 1865 cable.              A  more compact
cable (one   for instance with      less  gutta percha, less or no tow round
the iron wires, and somewhat more iron), even         if of equal strength and
equal weight per      mile in water, would have experienced less trans
verse resistance to motion         through the water, and therefore would
have run down        a much     steeper slope to the bottom.        Thus, even
with the same       longitudinal friction per mile, it would have         been
less resisted on the shorter          length; but even on the     same  length
it would have experienced much less longitudinal friction,             because
 of its smaller circumference.          Also, it is important to remark that
the roughness of the outer tow covering undoubtedly did very
 much to ease the egress strain, as it must have increased the fluid
friction greatly beyond what would have acted on a smooth gutta
 percha surface, or even on the          surface of smooth iron wires, pre
 sented by the more common form             of submarine cables.
    The speaker showed models illustrating the paying-out machines
 used  on the    Atlantic expeditions of 1858 and 1865. He stated
 that nothing could well be imagined more perfect than the action
 of the machine of 1865 in paying out the 1200 miles of cable
 then laid, and that      if it  were only to be used for paying out, no
 change either    in general plan or in detail seemed desirable, except
 the substitution of a softer material for the "jockey pulleys," by
which the cable      in entering the machine has the small amount of
resistance   applied to it which it requires to keep it from slipping
 round the main        drum.     The rate of egress of the cable was kept
 always under perfect control by a weighted friction brake of Appold's
 construction (which had proved its good quality in the 1858 Atlan
 tic expedition)   applied to a second drum carried on the same shaft

 500                 Proceedings       of the Royal      Society
  with the main drum.           When the weights were removed            from the
 brake (which      could be done almost instantaneously            by means of      a
 simple mechanism), the resistance             to the egress of the cable,      pro
             "
 duced by      jockey pulleys," and the friction at the bearings of              the
 shaft carrying the main drum, &c., was about               1\ cwt.
 Procedure    to  Repair    the Cable   in case of the appearance of an     electric
                              fault during   the laying.
     In the event of      a  fault being indicated        by the electric test     at
 any time during the paying out, the safe and proper course                        to
 be followed     in future (as proved by the recent experience),             if  the
cable is of the same construction as the present Atlantic                    cable,
 is instantly, on order given from an authorised officer in the electric
room, to stop and reverse the ship's engines, and to put on the
greatest safe weight on the paying-out break.                 Thus in the course
of a very short time the egress of the cable may be stopped, and,
if   the weather is moderate, the ship may be kept, by proper                use of
paddles, screw, and rudder, nearly enough in the proper position
for hours to allow the cable to hang down almost vertically, with
little more strain than the weight of the length of it               between     the
ship and the bottom.
    The best electric testing that has been practised or even planned
cannot show within a mile the position of a fault consisting of a
slight loss of insulation, unless both ends of the cable             are at band.
Whatever      its character      may be, unless the electric tests demon
strate its position      to be remote from the outgoing part, the only
thing that can        be done to find whether        it is just on board or    just
overboard, is to cut         the cable as near the outgoing part as              the
mechanical      circumstances       allow to be safely done.         The   electric
test immediately transferred to the fresh-cut seaward end shows in-
stantly   if the line is perfect between it and the shore.                  A   few
minutes more, and the electric tests applied to the two ends of                 the
remainder on board, will, in skilful hands, with a proper plan of
working, show very closely          the position     of the fault,   wltatevcr its
character may      he.   The engineers will thus immediately           be able to
make proper arrangements              for  resplicing and paying        out good
cable, and for cutting out the fault from the bad part.

       But   if the fault is between the land end and the fresh-cut                         sea
ward end on board ship, proper simultaneous                        electric tests on board

perly planned)           must be used to discover whether               the fault lies so
near the       ship that the right thing is to haul back the cable until it
is got on board.            If    it is   so, then steam power must be applied to
reverse the          paying-out machine,              and, by careful watching of the
dynamometer, and controlling the power accordingly (hauling in
slowly,      stopping, or veering out            a    little, but never letting the dyna
mometer         go above         60 or 65 cwt.),    the cable (which can bear 7
tons)       will not break, and             the fault will be got on board more

such    assertions with confidence now, because the experience of the
late    expedition       had not only verified the estimates of the scientific
committee        and    of the contractors            of the cable,
                                                      as to the strength
its weight in water
                    (whether deep or shallow), and its mechanical
manageability, but it had proved that in moderate weather the
Great        Eastern could, by skilful seamanship, be kept in position
and moved            in the manner required.                She had actually been            so
for thirty-eight hours, and eighteen hours during the operations
involved in the hauling back and cutting out the first and second
faults, and reuniting the cable, and during seven hours of hauling
in,    in   the attempt to repair the third fault.
  Should the simultaneous                  electric    testing on board and on shore
prove the        fault to    be 50 or 100 or more miles from                  the ship,      it
would depend on the character                   of the fault, the    season   of the year,
and the        means      and      appliances         on board, whether       it   would be
better to complete the line, and afterwards,                  if   necessary, cut out the
fault and repair, or to go back at once and cut out the fault be
fore attempting           to complete          the line.     Even the worst of these
contingencies would not be fatal to the undertaking with such                                 a
cable as the present one.                 But all experience of cable-laying shows
that almost          certainly the fault would either           be   found on board, or
but    a    very short distance overboard,              and would be reached and cut
out with scarcely any                really prompt measures, as above de

  The most striking part of the Atlantic undertaking proposed                      for
1866, is that by which the 1200 miles of excellent cable laid                       in
1865 is to be utilised by completing              the line to Newfoundland.
      That   a cable   lying on the bottom in water two miles                deep can
be caught by a grapnel and raised several hundred                     fathoms   above
the       bottom, was amply                eight days' work which
                                   proved by the
followed the breakage of the cable on the 3d of August last. Three
times out of four that the grapnel was let down, it caught the
cable, on each occasion after a few hours                   of dragging,     and with
only 300 or 400 fathoms more of rope than the 2100                         required to
reach the bottom by the shortest course.                The time when        the grap
nel did not hook the cable it came up with one of its flukes caught
round by its chain; and the grapnel, the short length of chain next
it,   and about 200 fathoms of the wire-rope, were proved to have                been
dragged along the bottom, by being found                    when brought on board
to have interstices         filled with soft light gray ooze (of which the
speaker showed         a   specimen to the Royal Society).    These results
are quite   in accordance with the dynamical theory indicated                    above
(see    Appendix II.), according to which length of such rope
                                                   a                            as the
electric cable, hanging down with no weight at its lower end,                      and
held by      a   ship moving through         the water at half    a   mile an    hour,
would slope down to the bottom at an angle from the vertical of only
22°   ;   and the much heavier and denser wire-rope that was used for
the grappling would go down at the same angle with                    a   considerably
more rapid motion of the ship, or at               a   much steeper elope with
the same rate of motion of the ship.
      The only remaining question is: How              is   the cable to be brought
to the surface when hooked           ?   The operations of last August           failed
from the available         rope,   tackle,    and hauling machine           not being
strong enough for this very unexpected work.                    On no occasion     w as
the electric       cable broken.*        With strong enough tackle,             and   a

hemp spun together, able to bear 14 tona, which was prepared merely aa buoy-
rope (to provide for tho contingency of being obliged, by stress of weather or
other cause, to cut and leave the cable in deep or shallow water), and was
accordingly all in 100 fathoms-lengths, joined by shackles with swivels.           The

hauling machine, both strong enough, and under perfect control, the
lifting of a submarine cable, as good in mechanical                                    quality       as the
Atlantic cable            of 1865, by a grapnel or grapnels, from the bottom
at a      depth of two miles, is certainly practicable.                              If    one attempt
fails, another           will succeed       ;    and there is every reason, from dyna
mics as         well    as from the 1865 experience,                  to believe      that in any
moderate weather the feat                       is to be accomplished             with little delay,
and       with very few         if any failing         attempts.
      The several plans of proceeding that have been proposed are of
two classes           — those in which, by three or more ships, it is proposed
to    bring a         point of the cable to the surface without breaking it at
all   ;   and those in which it is to be cut or broken, and a point of the
cable somewhat               eastward       from the break is to be brought to the
surface.
      With reference to either class, it is to be remarked that, by lift
ing simultaneously by several                         grapnels      so constructed              as to hold
the cable         without slipping along it or cutting             possible to it,   it   is
briDg      a    point of the cable to the surface without subjecting   to any                    it
strain amounting             to the weight of          a   length of cable equal to the depth
of    the water.          But   so many simultaneous                grapplings            by   ships cross
ing       the     line of cable at considerable                distances from one another
would be required,              that this possibility          is   scarcely to be reckoned on
practically, without cutting or breaking the cable at                                   a      point west
ward of the points raised                  by the grapnels.           On the other hand, with
but three ships the cable    might, no doubt, be brought to the surface
at    any point along the line, without cutting   and without subject  it,
ing       it   at any point to much more strain than the weight correspond
ing to the vertical depth, as                   is   easily seen when        it   is   considered that
the cable was             laid generally with from               10 to 15 per cent,                 of slack.
And        if     the cable     is   cut at some point              not      far westward of the
westernmost              of the grapnels, there can              be no doubt but               it   could be
lifted with great ease                by   three grapnels           hauled up simultaneously
wire and hemp rope            itself never broke, but on two of the three occasions a
Bwivel gave way.             On the last occasion, about 000 fathoms of Manilla rope
had to be used for the upper part, there not being enough                              of the wire buoy-
rope       left   ;   and when 700 fathoms of          it   had been got in,         it   broke on board
beside      a     shackle, and the remaining           200 fathoms of the Manilla, with                 1   540
fathoms           of wiro rope and the grapnel, and the electric cable which                           it   had
 hooked, were           all lost for the year     1865.

by three ships.     The catenaries concerned in these operations were
illustrated by a chain with 15 per cent, of slack hauled up simul
taneously    at three points.
    The plan which seemed to the speaker surest and simplest is to
cut the cable at any chosen point, far enough eastward of the pre
sent broken     end to be clear of entanglement           of lost buoy-rope,
grapnels, and the loose end of the electric cable        itself; and then,      or
as soon as possible after, to grapple and      lift at  a  point about    three
miles farther eastward.      This could    be well and safely done by two
ships, one of them with a cutting grapnel, and the other (the Great
Eastern herself) with a holding grapnel.           The latter, on hooking,
should haul up cautiously, never going beyond a safe strain, as shown
by the dynamometer.       The other, when assured that the Great Eastern
has the cable, should haul up, at first cautiously, but ultimately,
when the cable is got well off the bottom by the Great Eastern, the
western ship should move slowly eastwards, and haul up with force
enough to cut or break the cable.          This leaves three miles of        free
cable on the western side of the Great Eastern's grapnel, which will
yield freely eastwards (even if partly lying along the bottom at
first), and allow the Great Eastern to haul up and work slowly
eastwards, so as to keep its grappling rope, and therefore                  ulti
mately the portions of electric cable hanging down on the two
sides of its grapnel, as nearly vertical as is necessary to make sure
work of getting the cable on board.           This plan was illustrated        by
lifting, by aid of two grapnels,   a very fragile chain (a common brass
chain   in short lengths, joined by links of fine cotton thread) from
the floor of the Royal Society.       It  was also pointed out that      it  can
be executed    by one ship alone, with only a        little delay, but with
scarcely any risk of failure.     Thus, by first hooking the cable             by
a   holding grapnel,    and hauling     it up 200 or 300 fathoms           from
the bottom,    it may    be left there hanging by the grapnel-rope             on
a buoy,    while the ship proceeds three miles westwards, cuts the
cable there, and returns to the buoy. Then, it is an easy matter, in
 any moderate weather, to haul up safely and get the cable on board.
    The  use of the dynamometer in dredging was explained           ;  and the
 forces operating on the ship, the conditions of weather,             and    the
 means of keeping the ship in proper position during the process of

cient to act, when nearly vertical, with any sensible force on the ship,
were discussed at some        length.       The manageability          of the Great
Eastern, in skilful    hands, had been proved to be very much better
than could have been expected, and to be sufficient for the require
ments in moderate weather.            She has both screw and paddles — an
advantage possessed     by no other steamer in existence.                 By driving
the screw at   full power ahead, and backing the paddles, to prevent
the ship from  moving ahead, or (should the screw overpower the
paddles), by driving the paddles full power astern, and driving at
the same time the screw ahead with power enough to prevent the
ship from going astern, "steerage               way" is   created    by the lash of
water from     the screw against           the rudder;      and thus      the    Great
Eastern may be effectually steered without going ahead.                       Thus she
is,   in calm or moderate weather, almost as manageable as                a   small tug
steamer,    with reversing paddles, or as rowing boat. She can be
                                                  a
made     still more manageable than she proved to be in 1865, by
arranging to disconnect       either paddle        at any moment      ;   which, the
speaker was informed     by   Mr Canning, may easily be done.
      The speaker referred to   a    letter he had received from              Mr Can
    chief engineer of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance
ning,
Company, informing him that        intended to use three ships, and
                                      it   is
to    be provided   both with cutting and with holding grapnels, and
expressing great confidence as to the success of the attempt.                       In
this confidence the speaker          believed every practical man who wit
nessed    the Atlantic operations of 1865 shared,              as   did also, to his
knowledge, other engineers           who were not present on that expedi
tion, but who were well acquainted with the practice of cable-lay
ing and mending in various seas, especially in the Mediterranean.
The more he thought of          it   himself, both from what he had wit
nessed on board the Great Eastern,               and from attempts to estimate
on dynamical  principles the forces concerned, the more confident ho
felt that the contractors would succeed next summer in utilising
the cable partly laid in 1865, and completing     into an electrically

     These formulae apply to every case of uniform towing of a rope
 uoder water, or        bauling in, or paying out, whether                the lower end
 reaches the bottom            or not, provided always the lower end is free
from      tension; but     if it     is not on the bottom,      D must must denote
its vertical depth at any moment, instead                  of the whole depth of the
sea.       To apply to the        case   of merely towing, we must put m = 0 ; or,
to apply to hauling in, we must suppose u negative.
    It is to be remarked that the inclination assumed by the cable
under water does not depend on                 its longitudinal slip through the
water     (since we assume this not to influence the transverse com
ponent of fluid friction), and that, according to equation (4), it is
simply determined by the ratio of the ship's speed to the transverse
"settling velocity" of the cable.

"transverse settling velocity" of the cable for various degrees of

     1.   On the Dynamical Theory of                Heat          Part VII.       By
                         Professor W. Thomson.
     This paper commences with a condensed re-statement of                              the
fundamental    principles and formula of the Dynamical Theory of
Heat, from the first six parts of the author's treatment of the sub
ject previously communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
and his articles     "On the Thermo-elastic Properties of                     Matter,"
in    the
            " Quarterly Mathematical Journal " (April                   1855),          and
on " Thermo-magnetism," and " Thermo-electricity," in Nichol's
Cyclopedia (Edinburgh 1860).
  The chief object of the paper is the deduction                       of   numerical
values in absolute measure for the thermo-electric                     effects which
form the subject      of Part    VI.
                              of this series (" Transactions of the
                                        "
Royal Society of Edinburgh," 1854; and Phil. Mag." 1854, second
half year, and 1855, first half year), especially for differences of
temperature produced by electric convection of heat, and for the
changes of temperature due to strain in elastic solids, investigated in
the article on thermo-elastic       properties of matter above referred                   to.
The very valuable results, recently published, of the experiments of
Forbes and Angstrom for determining in absolute measure the
thermal conductivities of iron and copper, supply a very important
element, previously wanting, for definite estimates of those changes
of temperature, and are taken advantage of in the present paper.
Thus, the author has been enabled to give that practical                    character
to some of his former conclusions, of which, when they                      were        first
published, he pointed out the want.                In particular, with        reference
to elastic    solids, the apparent value of Young's                 modulus *       when
the stress is applied and removed, or reversed so rapidly that the
loss of thermal effect by conduction              and radiation is insensible,             is
proved to be given by the following formula               :   —
  * The amount of the force divided by tho elongation produced by                 it,   when
any force within practical limits of elasticity applied to elongate
                                                    is                        a   bar rod

in   absolute measure, derived                from experiments           by the author, are
used       to estimate         the effect of radiation and convection                 in dissi
pating energy               in virtue of the thermo-dynamic                 change of tem

                                          (as in the transmission of
sound along    bar) being equal to the velocity acquired by

changes         of temperature.         In iron, for    instance, the effect of change
of   temperature, when there             is   no dissipation,      is   an increase of about
one-third  per cent, on the Young's modulus, and of about one-
sixth per cent, on the velocity of sound along bar. The effect of   a
the conduction              of heat in diminishing the differences of tempera
ture in     a   rectangular       bar executing flexural vibrations,             is     investi
gated from the solution               invented by Fourier for expressing periodi
cal variations      of underground temperature.     Its absolute amount
for bars     of iron or copper, of stated dimensions, vibrating in stated
periods,     is   determined from Forbes' and Angstrom's conductivities.
It   is   proved that the loss of energy due to this effect at its maximum
is   not by any means insensible, though                it   is   not sufficient to account
for the whole loss            of energy which the author has found in experi-

       2.    The " Doctrine of Uniformity" in Geology briefly
               refuted.  By Professor William Thomson.
  The        " Doctrine of Uniformity " in                 Geology, as held by many of
the most eminent of British                    Geologists, assumes that the earth's
surface and upper crust have been nearly as they are at present
in temperature, and other physical qualities, during millions of
millions of years. But the heat which we know, by observation,
to be now conducted out          of the earth yearly is so great, that if                        this
action had been           going on with any approach to uniformity                                for
20,000        million years, the amount of heat lost out of the                              earth
would have been about as much as would                               heat, by 100° Cent.,           a
quantity of ordinary surface rock of                       100      times the earth's        bulk.
(See calculation appended.) This would be more than enough to
melt a mass of surface rock equal in bulk to the whole earth.
No hypothesis           as    to chemical         action, internal fluidity, effects               of
pressure at great depth, or possible character of substances                                in   the
interior of the earth, possessing the smallest vestige of probability,
can justify the supposition that the earth's upper crust has re
mained nearly as it              is,
                       while from the whole, or from any part,                                    of
the earth, so great          a   quantity of heat has            been lost.

The bulk of a sphere being its surface multiplied by £ of its radius,
the thermal capacity of a mass of rock equal in bulk to the earth,
and    of specific heat  s per unit of bulk is   ^
                                                    Ar«.   Hence         is  the
elevation of temperature which a quantity of heat equal                 to that
lost from the earth        in a year, would produce in a mass of rock
equal    in bulk to the whole earth. The laboratory experiments of
Peclet; Observations on Underground Temperature in three kinds
of rock in and near Edinburgh, by Forbes ; in two Swedish strata,
by   Angstrom, and at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, give values
of the conductivity in gramme-water               units of heat per square
centimetre, per 1° per centimetre of variation of temperature, per
second,    from -002 (marble, Peclet) to -0107 (sandstone of Craigleith
quarry, Forbes); and -005 may be taken as a rough average.
Hence, as there are 31,537,000 seconds in a year, we have A: ='005
  x 31,537,600, or approximately         15 x 10'.   The thermal capacity of
surface    rock is somewhere about half that of equal bulk of water          ; so
 that we may take s = -5.        And the increase      of temperature down
 wards may be taken as        roughly averaging      1° Cent.  per 30 metres      ;
 so,  that, D = 3000 centimetres.         Lastly, the earth's quadrant being
 according to the first foundation of the French metrical system,
 about 10» centimetres, we may take, in a rough estimate such as
 the present,    n=6   x 10" centimetres.      Hence,

 This, multiplied by 20,000 x       106,  amounts to 10,000, or to 100 times

    3.  Note on the Atomicity of Sulphur.                By Dr Alexander
                                 Crum Brown.
     We now know a considerable number of elements which exhibit,
  in their   compounds,     two or more distinct degrees of atomicity.
  Thus we      have   N triatomic in ammonia           and its   analogues,    in

    tlition products.       P   triatomic in PIT,, PCL,, phosphorous acid, and
    the phosphites; pentatomic           in PCl^ P0C13, HsP04, HPO,, &c.;
    C diatomic in CO, and tetratomic in almost all other compounds ;
    a large number of such examples might be adduced, but these may
    suffice.
        No chemist,      however,       as    far    as   I    know,   except   Kolbe     and
                          similar variety in the atomicity of sulphur.
    v. Oefele has assumed a
 I had long suspected that such a variable atomicity must be attri
 buted to sulphur, but the remarkable discoveries of v. Oefele have
 to my mind placed          it beyond         a doubt.        Indeed, so strong does      the
 evidence appear to me, that              I should        not have thought it necessary
 to trouble      the Society          with this note, had          I   not observed that
 some of our most eminent                 theoretical         chemists, as Hofmann        and
 Foster, still represent S            as diatomic      in such compounds        as SO, and
 H, S04.       I have    therefore      gathered together what seem the                  most
 cogent arguments in favour of the variable atomicity                       of sulphur.
      That S is diatomic         in    H.2S and the corresponding           metallic     sul
phides, in the mercaptans and alkyl-sulphides, is quite obvious,                         and
is admitted       by all.       I need therefore           spend no time on this part
of the subject.  Let us then turn to those compounds in which
there is reason to suspect the presence of tetratomic sulphur.
These are S02, SO CI,, M2S03, S(CaH6)3I, and its derivatives.                            The
latter series of substances discovered by v. Oefele seem to me quite
inexplicable, except by the assumption of tetratomic sulphur, and
I    have never seen an attempt to explain their constitution in any
other way.*  But even leaving them out of the question, the                           most
natural explanation of the constitution of S02 and M2S03                           is,   that
their sulphur atom          is   tetratomic.          Formula3 can, indeed, be con
structed with diatomic sulphur, which represent the composition                            of
these bodies;      but   if   we examine            these formulae we easily see that
                                                                                  "
    •Wurtz, in    a note to a paper by v. Oefele on " Diethyl Salphan   in the
Bulletin de la    Soei4t6 Chimique du Paris for February 1865, formulates that
among other sulphur compounds on the assumption of diatomic sulphur. But
itmust be remembered that this body (C2H5)2S02, contains in the molecule
only two monad radicals, so that      takes its place beside chloride of sulphuryl
                                         it

they are in many points             of view forced and unnatural          ;   in other
words, that they are not what an unbiased consideration of the
composition and properties of the substances would naturally lead
to. This is still more the case with those substances in which the
sulphur appears to be hexatomic.                   These are S03, M3S04, M2S2Oc,
and the numerous         derivatives      of    HaSO^,   which contain    (SOJ*;        as
thesebodies, like the sulphites, contain, in the molecule, only two
monad atoms, it        is,
                     of course, possible to represent their composi
tion    by   formula3 containing diatomic sulphur.*             Thus —
Sulphurous Anhydride.              Sulphite.               Sulphuric Anhydride.
                     0-<°K^h2)-0-®.&c.
                                      Sulphate.
  Examining these formulae we find that these stable substances
have some  of the oxygen equivalents saturated by oxygen    this                  ;
  of course, possible indeed we know bodies such as H202, Ba02,
is,                          ;
Ag,On Brodie's peroxides, &c., in which this arrangement   pro                    is
bable   ;    but all these bodies are remarkable for instability, and for
the readiness with which they lose oxygen.     They present ab
solutely no points of resemblance to the substances we are now
considering.  The striking analogy of SO2 and S03 to CO and COa
also leads to the conclusion           that the former
                                              S''Oa and the latter

Sri0„ and that in both of them all the oxygen      combined withis
sulphur.        If
              we accept this view, and follow out the analogy
between the carbon and the   sulphur compounds, we get       simple           a
explanation of many relations otherwise difficult to be understood.
For instance, hypo-sulphuric acid obviously stands in the same
relation     to sulphurous       anhydride and sulphuric acid        as   oxalic acid

  hypo-sulphuric    acid is formed by the reaction of sulphurous        acid

   By means of the same assumption we get a simple explanation
of the relations of the sulphites to sulphates, and to hypo-sulphites.

   same subject       by   Dr R. Rubenson,* containing         a series   of valuable
, observations made at Rome on the place of maximum                      polarisation,
   and on      the intensity of the maximum polarisation at different
  hours     of the day. Important observations on the polarisation of
  the atmosphere          have also been made by        M. Liais and M. Andres
  Poey,       and the value        of such observations, in determining the
  height and constitution of our atmosphere, has been                      universally
  recognised.
       Under this impression, the author was induced to submit to the
  Society the rest of the four years' observations which he made at
  St   Andrews, which, along with those already published, all exhibit
  the   optical condition of the atmosphere during many days of every
  month       of the year.
  2.   Notices of some Ancient Sculptures on the Walls of Caves
                    in Fife. By Professor J. Y. Simpson.
       The county of Fife abounds in caves or " weems" — a derivative
   from    the Gaelic name for caves — and their existence gives a title to
   the   earldom of Wemyss.           Some of the caves in Fife are historical,
   as  St Rule's at St Andrews, St Adrian's near Elie, and St Mar
   garet's at Dunfermline.           St Serf of Culross, the great patron saint
   of the west of Fife, is described by one of his biographers as having
   usually      spent the forty days of Lent in a cave named, as such
    retreats often were, the Desertum.            This cave at the Desertum —
    (or Dysart, to use the modern form of the name) — was used as a
    church up till near the time of the Reformation. About two miles
    eastward of Dysart, and near the village of Easter Wemyss, there
    is a range    of large    caves,  seven   or eight of which      are    at the pre
    sent    time   open   ;  but several more probably          exist,  having their
    openings covered over with debris.           They stand about 15 or 20 feet
    above the level       of high tide.     Some of them are 80 to 100 feet in
     length, and of corresponding         height and breadth.        Two or three of
     them are perfectly        dark, and require to be entered with candles.
     Last   summer, when on a professional            visit  to  Fife, Dr Simpson
      made   a hurried   visit   to two  of these cavef, along with Dr Dewar,

  522                      Proceedings       of the Royal Society
 and saw some rude sculpturings in one of them.                          This   discovery in
 duced him to return for further search, accompanied by his friends,
 Drs Joseph Robertson, Duns, and Paterson, when two or                             three new
 caves were visited, and their walls found to be covered at different
 points with representations of various animals, figures, and emblems.
   The cave sculpturings in Fife are of special interest to the
 Scotch archaeologist, for this reason, that they exactly resemble, in
 type and character, the carvings on the so-called Sculptured                           Stones
 of Scotland.             In his     magnificent       first volume on the        Sculptured
 Stones of Scotland,              Mr Stuart has collected one hundred               and fifty
 examples      ;   and latterly perhaps fifty more have been discovered.
 These Sculptured               Stones extend along the whole east coast of Scot
 land, from the Forth northwards.                      Only two have been found          south
 of the Forth.            In    general ornamentation,          they resemble the       sculp
 tured stones of the west of Scotland, Ireland, Wales, and England                                 ;
 but the peculiarity of the Scotch                     stones   is,   that they have     addi
 tional figures and symbols upon them that have been seen                           nowhere
 else in the world.    These peculiar and characteristic                             symbols
 consist of the crescent or crescent-ornament,   sometimes inter
 sected with the   sceptre of the so-called spectacle ornament—
                          V              ;
a    double set of circles connected by middle lines — with or without
 the     Z   sceptre   ;    of figures
                              of elephants, fish, serpents,                          mirrors,
 combs, arches, or tores, &c.  The arrangement of these                              symbols
 upon the stones           is   in no two instances alike.            On the oldest     stones
they     are cut upon           unhewn blocks, without any surrounding                   orna
mentation.           In    the Sculptured Stones of            a   later date, they are      cut
in   a   raised form, with surrounding ornamentations,                      and often       com
bined with figures of the Christian cross.                      Other figures      are found
carved on these stones, as portraits of priests and dignitaries,                            pro
cessions of men        ;    the sacrifice of the bull      ;    war and hunting scenes;
animals, native and foreign, as the lion, tiger, camel, and monkey;
the battling and devouring of men by wild animals;                                men       with
monster heads of beasts and birds                  ;   representations     of dragons       and
monsters,      &c.        There     is   one instance     of the representation             of   a
boat and another of             a   chariot, at Meigle.
  These   rude sculpturings have, with one exception, been pre
viously to the present time found only on sepulchral stones but                         ;
in th« Fife caves they exist in great abundance
                                                on the cave walls.

                              of Edinburgh, Session 1865-66.                                        523
 These walls are usually comparatively                         smooth     ;   and in many places,
though not        in all, they retain the figures cut upon them.     The
cave       figures consist of animals, as the elephant,  — exactly of the
form       seen on the Sculptured Stones, —  the deer, the dog, the swan,
the peacock,   fish, serpents, and monsters. On them we see also
representations of the mirror, comb, and arch or horse-shoe. No
perfect example of the crescent ornamentation                                 exists in these cave
sculpturing^             ;   but many specimens of the spectacle ornament                               are
to be      found on their walls, both with and without the intersecting
Z sceptre.
     One     of the           cave-figures       is specially       interesting,    from the fact
that    it is the exact counterpart of the only analogous carving found
on   aught except     monolith, viz., a scale of silver armour presented
                                  a
to   the Antiquarian   Museum of Scotland by Mrs Durham of Largo,
and     whose history is this : — A man still living in Fife — a huckster
— acting, it is said, upon an old tradition, that a knight lay buried
in silver armour in a small barrow called Norrie's Law, stealthily
dug     into       it,   found in reality the silver armour, and removed and
sold    it      in pieces to the amount,                  it   is   alleged,    of four hundred
ounces.           By the time this spoliation                   was discovered,              the silver
armour was all melted, except                      a   few fragments.          One of these frag
                   a scale,       having cut upon              spectacle ornament traversed

by    the          sceptre, and having appended to one end of                           it    the head
and shoulders                of   a     dog, as in some        modern Orders of European
knighthood.             similar figure, with the appended dog'8
                             Precisely     a
head,  carved upon the interior of one of the Wemyss caves.
           is
  On the walls of some of the caves there are crosses of various
forms; and in two or three parts appearances somewhat resembling
letterings, and symbolic                       arrangements of figures or hieroglyphics.
On the walls             of St Adrian's         caves are lines which some have believed
to    be    half obliterated               Runes;      and the Rev.           Mr Skinner of St
Andrews has              a   loose stone from this spot which presents, he thinks,
Runic characters.
     Among          the cave sculpturings at Wemyss, there                         is   a   figure of   a
man        of diminutive form; and Mr Stuart has traced among them
faded outlines of      full sized human figure, apparently tailed, as
                              a                                       he                         if
formed       one of the provokingly missing links which some enthusi
astic      ethnologists               are so anxiously    and vainly searching after.

 f)24                   Proceedings   of the Royal Society
     The   caves       of Fife, both those that have sculptures               and those
without     them, have almost all occasional complete perforations or
holes cut in their sides, and in their floors aud roof, capable of
allowing     a    thong or rope to    be passed    through,         as   if   they were
intended to suspend or to affix objects.
     The   age   of these cave-sculptures can only   be fixed by approaching
the age of the analogous figures upon the Sculptured Stones.                           The
earliest    of the Sculptured       Stones are perhaps very old— possibly
as far back,      if   not farther, than the period of the Roruan               invasion.
In opening last year          a large cairn at   Linlethan in Forfarshire,                  a
figure of the elephant,          exactly similar to those existing                  on our
sculptured stones, was found on a stone lying upon the covering                            of
the stone-enclosed cist.          This cist contained     a    bronze weapon              and
an urn.   The elephant sculpture was as old, therefore, as the era of
urn burial and bronze weapons — except the carved fragment of
stone had        got     by pure accident   into its present position                 when
the barrow was opened twenty years ago.              The ancients              sometimes
buried both stone and bronze relics with their dead, after apparently
they had iron instruments          and weapons.     But       if   the bronze       dagger
at Linlethan was a weapon used by the person buried                             under     the
cairn, the date is probably pre-Roman.            For when Agricola                 invaded
Scotland     in a.d. 81, our Caledonian          forefathers         had       apparently
already passed          through the bronze era, as, according                 to Tacitus,
they fought        the Soman     legions with swords
                                                          " long and without                a
point ;" in other words, with iron swords.
   But most of the Sculptured Stones, particularly the more elaborate
varieties of them, were of comparatively later date, and were pro
bably erected as late as the eighth or tenth century. An elaborate
specimen  found buried in the old churchyard of St Vigeans, having
upon its surface the spectacle ornament, the crescent, the mirror,
the comb, &c., in raised figures, has an inscription on   which               it,           is
probably the only Pictish inscription and sentence now remaining.
It   speaks of the stone as erected to Drosten, the son of Voret and                  ;
a    Pictish king Drosten was killed in the battle of Blathmig
or Elethmont—   mile or two off— in the year 729,

                                                                              as we   learn
from the Annals of Tighearnach.
                                  The Fife cave      sculptures                            at
Wemyss are mixed up with numerous
                                     forms of crosses, particularly
of equal-limbed Greek
                      crosses, showing that they were cut after

                      of Edinburgh,     Session 1805-66.                       .025
the introduction        of Christianity   ;   and in one or two spots there
are    appearances      of Christian    monograms.        Within St Adrian's
cave at Caplawchy, near Elie, there are many crosses on the walls                  ;
stone seats cut out, &c.       ;  but no animals or symbols.
    The purposes for which they were cut, and the meaning of the
mysterious symbols on the caves and sculptured stones, are archae-
ological enigmata that no one has yet solved. As long as they
were    found on sepulchral monoliths only, they           were supposed to bo
hieroglyphic       or heraldic funeral      inscriptions or emblems.          This
doctrine      is so  far gainsaid by this late discovery of them on the
walls     of  caves.    But possibly they may be sacred symbols of some
description, or of some unknown form and meaning.                    For around
and upon his gravestones man has always been in the habit of
cutting emblems of his religion when he has cut anything                 ;  things
sacred and things sepulchral           being found united in his earliest
carvings.
    Other Scotch caves           have  sculptures      cut upon them.          The
so-called Cave of Bruce, in the Island of Arran, has been found
by    Dr Mitchell and Mr Stuart to have deer and serpents carved on
its walls ; and many years ago, within St Maine's cave in Holy
 Island, Dr Daniel Wikon found ancient Scandinavian inscriptions
 written in Runes.
     In many counties in Scotland, both on the sea shore and inland,
 there    exist large caves, the walls of which require to be now            care
 fully examined, in order to find if our ancient forefathers                   had
 carved     upon them any such emblems and sculpturings as have
 been    traced in Fife. The Fife caves have formerly been inhabited.
 Dr Simpson showed from one of the Wemyss caves                   a collection   of
 bones    which had     been split to remove their marrow, like the bones
 found in the old Danish midden heaps,           ifcc.  Among the bones       were
 those    of the deer, sheep, ox, Ac. There were also shells of limpets,
 &c. ;    and microscopic remains of cereals were found in cavities in
 the   rocks that had been apparently            used as rubbers or querns.
 Perforated stones and two implements from the tyre of the deer's
  horn were picked up from the rubbish upon the floor; but the
  debris of these caves requires to be most carefully searched, before
  all that could      be ascertained   on this point becomes known               to
  archaeologists.      In Scotland, there      is one cave    still occasionally

526               Proceedings     of the Royal   Society
inhabited,   at Wick, and within which      Dr Mitchell has    seen  living
a  family of eight or ten. But cave men are common elsewhere.
Mr Barnwell has lately recorded the curious fact, that in the
neighbourhood      of Charters   there  are at present    living, in  caves,
150,000 men, in the very centre of France.           In Africa,  Asia, &c,
caves are still inhabited,    as   they were by the Troglodites           and
Horites of old.
   In England,    we know that in archaic times caves were inhabited
by the men of those distant ages, such as Kent's Hole, the Brixham
Cave, the Kirkdale     caves, &c.    In  these caves the bones of        man
have been found with his stone weapons, and along with them                the
bones of long extinct animals, as the mammoth, the cave bear,              the
hyaena, &c.     But in his earliest and rudest times, man has         been a
sculpturing and painting animal      ; and his old attempts in this       way
may yet be found upon the walls of those ossiferous English            caves.
Sir Charles Nicolson had stated to Dr Simpson,        as a proof that man,
in his savage state, was a sculpturing being, the curious fact, that
at the head of Sydney harbour rude sculpturings of the kangaroo,
&c., had been found cut on the rocks, when the turf was removed
in building operations there. Mr Graham had likewise informed
him that at the Cape, the Bushmen, one of the rudest existing races
of humanity, live much in caves, and constantly paint on the walls
of them the animals in their neighbourhood, and sometimes battle
and hunting scenes,      always in profile.     Mons. Lartet has        lately
shown that the caves of Perigord have been inhabited             by  archaic
man, at a time       when   apparently    he  had no metallic weapons,
when the reindeer still inhabited       the south of France, and         when
even the dog was not yet a domestic          animal.     Yet amongst       the
relics found in these Perigord caves have been discovered sculptur
ings upon stone, bone, and ivory, of different animals       ; and latterly
a rude sketch    of the mammoth itself.      All this entitles us to     hope
that,  if these cave researches are prosecuted, we may yet find             od
the cave walls sculpturings done by man in the most ancient            times,
and containing fragments of his earliest history.
    [Dr Simpson's communication was illustrated by numerous draw
 ings of the Fife cave sculptures, made by Mr Drummond, R.S.A.,
and Dr Paterson of Leith.]

     In the " Flora Nova3-Zelandia>" of Dr Hooker there is              no record   of
  any species of Opegrapha, Platygrapha, Umbilicaria, or Abrolhallus;
  and Professor       Churchill Babington therein specially remarks, in
  deed, on the supposed absence of the genera Opegrapha and Umbili
 caria (Gyrophora) from the Lichen-Flora of New Zealand. Sub
 sequent researches have, however, shown that these genera are                  really
 represented, their apparent absence having been due probably                        to
 their not having been specially looked for. The foregoing list ex
 hibits three species of Opegrapha, all new, being all the Opegrapha
 contained in the author's collection          ;  and Dr   Knight and Mr       Mitten
 have described other three species,* two of them new, as occurring
 in the North Island.           The author's Otago collection also           contains
 at least one species of Umbilicaria — a British one — U. polyphylk,
 L., and he has little doubt others will be discovered when the
 Lichens of the New Zealand Alps              are specially    collected.

  1.  Notes for a Comparison of the Glaciation of the West
      of Scotland with that of Arctic Norway.                  By Archibald
      Geikie, Esq., F.R.S.
     In the course of the detailed investigations which, during               the
 past six or seven years, have heen carried on by the officers of the
 Geological Survey into the history of the glacial period in Britain,
 the desire naturally arose to compare the phenomena of glaciation
 so  familiar in this country with those of some other region              where
 they might be linked on to the action of       still existing glaciers.       No
 other part of Europe offered so many facilities for such a comparison
 as were to be found in Scandinavia.           It was    accordingly   planned
 by my colleague, Dr      John Young, and myself, to visit Norway in          the
 summer of 1863.        Unforeseen circumstances        delayed the journey,
and ultimately deprived me of the companionship            of my friend. Nor
 was it until  June of last year (1865) that, accompanied by two of
 my associates in the Geological Survey, Mr W. Whitaker and Mr
James Geikie,      I  reached the Arctic Circle.         All  the Norwegian
observations     recorded in this paper were made conjointly                 with
these companions.
    The objects proposed to     be accomplished   in this excursion     were —
to compare, as     minutely   as time would allow, the ice-marks         on the
rocks of Scotland with those on the rocks of Scandinavia            ; to   ascer
tain, from personal exploration, how far the glaciation of the Nor
wegian coasts and fjords could be traced to the action of land                ice
or of floating bergs    ;  to trace, if possible, the connection between
the ancient     ice-work    and the work of the       living glaciers    ;  and,
generally,   to watch   for any facts that might help to throw light
upon the history of the glacial period in the British Isles. Having
only    a few weeks     at our disposal,    we were far from       aiming     at
original discovery in Norwegian         geology.     The main     features of

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1865-66.                                      531
the disposition of the snow-fields                     and glaciers      had already been
given in the masterly sketch                    of Principal       Forbes   — a work which
was      of inestimable value to us.*                   More detailed        descriptions      of
parts of the glaciation of Norway had been published                              by Scandi
navian geologists — Esmark,f Horbye,J Kjerulf,§                          Sexe,||  and others.
Yet      I was not without the hope that, besides adding to our own
experience, we might also be fortunate enough to find in the                               Nor
wegian fjords materials for making                       still more clear the geological
history of our own western sea-lochs.

 of the agent by which the striie were produced.                In  a concluding   section upon
 the glacial theory, he says : — "          II est vrai sans douto qu'en general la direc

  general   agent may be.

 at once arrests the attention of every traveller in Norway, to whom
 the scenery of the western                   Highlands is familiar, depends upon
 a close similarity in the geological                    structure of the rocks, and a
 coincidence in the geological history of the surface of the two
 regions.       Norway, from south to north, is almost wholly made up
 of metamorphic rocks, not all of the same age, yet possessing a
general similarity of character.                    In like   manner, the west of Scot
 land, from the           Mull of Cantyre to Cape 'Wrath, is in great                  measure
built up of gneiss, schist, slate, quartz-rock, granite, and                               other
metamorphic rocks, quite comparable with these of Norway.*

     Besides the external resemblance duo to the lithological nature of
 the rocks, beneath        there is a still further likeness dependent upon
similarity,       partly of geological structure, and partly of denudation.
Many of the Scottish sea-lochs have had their trend determined
by lines      of strike or of anticlinal axis, and the          same result seems
to have      taken place in Norway. In other cases, the lochs and
glens     of the one country, and the fjords and valleys of the other,
cannot be traced to any           determining geological structure, but must
be referred to the great process of denudation which has brought
the surface to its present form.*                  In short, Norway and the
Scottish Highlands seem to be but parts of one long table-land                       of
palaeozoic      (chiefly metamorphic) rocks. This table-land must be of
venerable antiquity; for it seems to have been in existence, at
least    in part, as far back as the Lower Old Red Sandstone. Since
that    time it has been sorely defaced by long cycles of geological
revolution       ; rains, rivers, ice, and general atmospheric waste, have
carved      out of it the present valleys, and to all this surface change
must      be added the results of dislocations, as well as unequal up
heavals and depressions of the crust of the earth beneath.                    Never
theless,     it still survives in extensive fragments in Norway, where
 it serves as a platform        for the great snow-fields, while it can even
 yet   be traced along the undulating summits of the mountains of
 the   Scottish Highlands.          One of its latest great revolutions was a
 submergence towards           the west, which extended from the coasts of
 Ireland to the north of Norway, and gave rise to some of the most
 distinctive features of that part of Europe.              No one can attentively
 consider the maps of the countries             between the headlands of Con-
 naught and the North              Cape, without being convinced            that the
 endless     ramifying sea-lochs and fjords, kyles and sounds, were once
 land valleys.         Each loch and fjord is the submerged part of                   a
  valley, of which we       still see the upper portion above water, and the
 important at present in showing that, both in Norway and in Scotland, there
  is a bottom gneiss covered unconformably          by strata containing fossils, and
  that these strata are again overlaid by an upper and later series of meta
  morphic rocks of Lower Silurian ago.

sunken rocks and skerries, islets and islands', are all so many relics
of the uneven surface of the old land.             The indented      form of the
coast-line    of the west of Scotland        and of Norway is not evidence
of the unequal encroachments of the sea, but is due                 to a general
submergence of the west side of the two countries,                  whereby    the
tides have been       sent far inland,    filling from side to      side ancient
valleys and lakes.*         Subsequent      re-elevations     are marked along
both the Norwegian and Scottish shores by successive terraces                     or
raised beaches.
    But  to one who has sailed        and boated among the sea-lochs of
Scotland, no feature of the Norwegian coast is at once so striking
and so familiar as the universal           smoothing      and rounding of       the
rocks, which is now recognised as the result of the abrading power
of ice.    Every skerry and islet among the countless thousands of
that coast-line is either one smooth boss of rock, like the back of a
whale or dolphin, or a succession of such bosses rising and sinking
in gentle undulations into each other. Such, too, is the                nature of
the rocky shore of every fjord ; the smoothed surface                    growing
gradually rougher, indeed, as we trace it upward from the               sea-level,
yet continuing to show itself, until at a height of many hundred
feet it merges into the broken,            scarped outlines       of the   higher
mountain      sides and summits.f       In short, as is now well known, the
whole of the surface of the country, for many hundred feet above
the sea, has been ground down and smoothed by ice.
    We sailed      along   the coast of Norway,          between Bergen        and
Hammerfest,        by the usual      steamboat     route, touching at many
stations by the way, threading the narrow kyles and sounds that
lie among the innumerable          islands, and now and then running in
land up some fjord far into the heart of the country.                  We  halted
here and there to spend a few days at a time in exploring some                    of
the fjords and glaciers.       What can        be seen   from the steamer        on
the coasting voyage is now familiar from the numerous descriptions
which have been given of it iu recent years.                    I shall therefore

content          myself with offering           to the Society             an account         of two
excursions to some distance from the                     ordinary route.
      A little to the north of the Arctic Circle lies the island of Melo,
one      of many which are here crowded together along the coast.                                 It
is only noticeable,             inasmuch as it is a station at which the steamers
call, and from    which the great snow-fields of the Svartisen or Fon-
dalen     may be most easily visited. Here, as along all the rest of the
Norwegian coasts, we find ourselves among bare bossy hummocks
of rock      thoroughly ice- worn.              From the higher eminences the                    eye
sweeps                     islets and skerries, and far across the
             over the countless
Vest Fjord to the serrated peaks of the Lofodden Islands, which
from      the distance seem deep sunk in the north-western                            sea.      The
whole  of the lower grounds is one labyrinth of rochvs moutonnee?,
raising their smooth backs like so many porpoises out of the sea,
and out      of    a flat expanse of green pasture and dark hog which here
covers an         old sea-bottom.   The striations and groovings are still
fresh     on many of the smoothed surfaces of gneiss, and invariably
run      straight out to         sea in the    line of the long valley up which the
sea      winds     inland        among    the    snowy        mountains.         It   cannot      be
doubted          that   a vast mass     of ice has come seawards down this valley,
and      that all these ice-worn hummocks of rock were ground down
by    it.    The wide valley or opening which stretches inland from
Melo,       is   formed       by the converging        mouths of         a   numher of narrow
fjords.          Of these the most northerly                   is    the     Glommens         Fjord,
which       is   hounded along its northern side by                  a   range of high moun
tains,      with   a    serrated crest and abundant snowy clefts and corries.
Southward           lies   a   helt of lower ice-worn hills, cut lengthwise                   by the
Bjerangs          Fjord, and bounded            on the south         by the Holands Fjord,
on the       south side of which              rises another         range of scarped snow-
covered          mountains.*
      From the gaard of Melo we boated eastwards among various small
'slets and channels, passing soon                    into the Holands Fjord, up which
we     continued until we rested underneath the great snow-field                                 and
                                                                   no definite system of ridges;
  *
         Although   I      use the word mountains,    there   is
      the contrary, these fjords must be regarded as indentations                 along the edgo
°f   a   great tahle-land, of which the average level may rango from 3000 to 4000
feet above       the sea, and which serves as the platform on which tho wido snow-
fieHs lie.        See " Norway and its Glaciers," pp. 190, 232.

 glaciers of Svartisen.      Iu this excursion    we started from the coast,
 amid   islands,    all moulded,    like those of the west of       Scotland,
 by the ice of the glacial period,        and we ended among rocks           on
 which the present glaciers are inscribing precisely the same mark
 ings.    One of the first features which arrested attention was the
contrast    between     the smoothed,     ice-worn    surface  of the    lower
grounds and the craggy, scarped outlines of the mountain                crests.
     Fig.  1. — Map of the Neighbourhood   of the Holands Fjord (Munch).
This   was especially     marked along the northern side       of the   Glom-
uiens Fjord, where the ice-worn          rocks form a distinct zone      along
the side of the rough, craggy hills.         To the north of Melovaerthis
ice-worn belt was estimated by aneroid to rise about 200 feet            above
the sea.     Its smoothed rocks    are abundantly    rent along lines of joint
and other divisional planes      ;  their ice-worn     aspect must thus       be
imperceptibly      fading away. The rough rocks above them some
times show traces of smoothed surfaces, as if they too had suffered
from an older glaciation, of which the records are now all                  but
obliterated.      The line of division between the belt of rocks        wbicl
have been smoothed by ice, and those which have been roughened
and scarped by atmospheric           waste, slopes gently upward       in   the
direction     of the central    snow-fields    of the interior.     While     at
Melovaer      it seemed   to rise only about 200 feet above         the sea;
at  Fondaleu, twenty-five       or thirty miles     inland, it mounts     to a

 height of      fully 1500 feet.      A   tract of bare hills, lying between the
 Glotnmens and the Holands Fjord, and rising eastward into the
snow-covered table-land, is well smoothed in the direction                 of these
fjords.      In sbort,    the whole of the broad depression between the
two fjords        has been filled with ice, moving steadily downwards
from the      snow-fields to the sea.
    It   was interesting to watch, on every little islet and promontory
under     which we       passed,  the same     details of glaciation   so  familiar
along the       margin of our Scottish fjords.          The rocks   are, as usual,
smoothed        into flowing lines, and slip sharply and cleanly into the
water.      They are well grooved and striated, these markings differ
ing in no respect         from those in Britain.        Moreover, it was easy to
see   that the ice which         had graven      these lines must have moved
down the       fjord, for the    lee or rougher side of the crag looked sea
wards.       It was    likewise clear that the scorings were not the work of
drifting bergs or coast ice, for they could often be seen mounting
over projecting parts of the banks, yet retaining all the while their
sharpness,        parallelism, and persistent trend. Another point of
similarity to west Highland scenery, was found in the strange
scarcity or absence of drift and boulders.               I do not mean to assert
that these are not to be met             with at all, but they do not exist so
prominently        as  to catch the eye even of one who is on the outlook
 for   them.      The rock everywhere raises its bare knolls to the sun
as   it does   on the coasts of Inverness and Argyll. To complete the
 resemblance, the Norwegian             fjord has its sides marked by the line
 of a    former sea-margin, about 250 feet above the present. This
 terrace winds out and in among all the ramifications and curves of
 the fjord,      remaining fresher and more distinct than the raised
 beaches     of the west Highlands usually           are, and even  rivalling   one
 of the parallel      roads of Lochaber.
     We rested for a week at the hamlet of Fondalen, on the south
 side   of the Holands Fjord.         It stands   at the mouth of a deep narrow
 valley on the      lineof   the terrace, which here runs along the crest of
  a
    steep   bank of rubbish covered with enormous blocks of rock — an
  old   moraine thrown       across the end of the valley.        There   seems to
  have been      at one time       a lake    behind   this bank, formed by the
  ponding back       of the drainage of the valley, and gradually emptied
  *s the   outflow-stream deepened its channel through the moraine.

At     the head       of the valley     a small   glacier descends from the snow-
field      of Svartisen.        There could     be no better
                                                   locality for studying
the     gradual diminution of the glaciers, and for learning that it
was     land-ice that filled the Norwegian fjords, over-rode the lower
It i lis   and mountains,         and went out boldly into the Atlantic                    and
Arctic Sea.            The Holands Fjord runs,               as       I   have said, approxi
mately east           and west, and this short narrow valley descends from
the south.         The fjord was filled with ice, and is therefore polished
and        striated along the line of its main trend.        The valley of
Fondalen         was likewise          filled with ice, moving down to join the
mass        in the fjord    ;   and its rocks, too, are striated               in the length
of the       valley, or from south to north.                 The moraine of Fondalen
is aproof that a glacier once descended to the Holands Fjord at
that point.  Further evidence is found in the fact, that the sides
<'f   the valley are ground             and striated for 700 feet and more above
its bottom.            Moreover,       these polished        and scored rocks can be
traced       up to and underneath the glacier.                    I
                                                   crept for some yards
under        the ice, and found the floor of gneiss on which it rested
smoothly        polished        and covered with scorings of all sizes, exactly
the same         in every respect           as those        high on the sides of the
valley,   in the fjord below, and away on the outer islands and
skerries.    Over this polished surface trickled the water of the
melted        ice, washing        out sand and small           stones from         under   the
plncier.
   We climbed the steep eastern side of the valley above the foot
of the glacier, and found the hummocks of gneiss wonderfully gla
ciated up to a height of fully 700 feet. The gnarled crystalline
rock has been ground away smoothly                      and sharply, so as to show its
twisted foliation, ns well as the patterns of a marble, are displayed
on a       polished    chimney-piece.     Even vertical or overhanging faces
of rock are        equally       smoothed and striated.  Many of the roches
mmitonntes are loaded             with perched blocks of all sizes, up              to masses
30     or 40 feet long.          Above    the   limit to which            we traced the work
of the ice, the rocks begin               to wear       a   more rugged surface, until
along the summit         of the ridges they rise into serrated crests and
 pinnacles.        This rougher outline    of course, the result of atmo
                                                  is,
spheric waste, guided             by   the geological structure and chemical com
 position      of the rocks.

    The glacier descends from the snow-field, which           was guessed     to
have there an elevation of about 3500 feet, to a point in the valley
about 400 feet above the sea.           The distance from the snow-field      to
the foot of the glacier looks not much more than one English
mile   — at least it is but short, compared with the rapidity of             de
scent.      Hence the glacier is steep, and in some places much ere-
vassed.      Issuing from the upper snow, in a steep, broken, and jagged
slope of blue ice, it descends by a series of steps, till, getting com
 pacted again in the valley below, it passes into a solid, firm glacier,
 with a tolerably smooth surface, forming a declivity of 12° or             15°.
           Fig. 3. — Longitudinal Section of smaller Glacier. Fondalen.
 At   a  point about half     a mile or less from the foot of the       glacier
the valley suddenly contracts, and the glacier, much narrowed              and
compressed, tumbles over a second steep declivity in a mass of
broken ice.      The crevasses speedily unite, and after another descent
of 300 or 400 yards at an angle of 25°, the glacier comes to an
end.      At the point where the strangulation        takes place, the glacier
lies in a kind of basin, of which the lower lip presents proofs of          the
most intense erosion.         On the western bank, in particular,       a mass
of the mountain side which projects into the ice has             been ground
away, and shows plainly enough, by its form and strias, that                the
glacier, ascending from the basin, has climbed up and over this            bar
rier,   bo as  to tumble down its northern       or seaward side.
   The course of this little glacier is now too short to admit of           the
formation of moraines.          Yet there   are large   heaps of rubbish   and
enormous masses of rock scattered over the valley below, and                tk

rilled the      valley, its surface received abundant detritus from the
mountain        slopes     on either side.

  542                    Proceedings         of the Royal       Society
  scribed, and it is occupied by a much longer and larger glacier.                          To
  one who looks up the valley from the opposite side                       of the    fjord, it
  seems as      if the ample glacier which fills up the bottom                         sweeps
  down from the snow-field                in  a  rapid descent to the very            edge of
  the sea.      On a visit to the locality, however, it is found that                       be
  tween the foot of the glacier and the sea margin, there lies                         a plain
  of shingle and alluvium, which is partly covered with a brushwood
  of birch, and partly with a scanty pasturage.                       As it nears the ice
  it rises into ridges and hummocks, which increase in size                             as we
  ascend.       These are true moraine mounds, rising often 60 or                       70 feet
  above their base, and strongly reminding me of the moraines                                 at
  Loch Skene, Peeblesshire.                 They consist of earth and            stones,    and
 are strewed over with large blocks              of gneiss, porphyry, limestone, and
 other crystalline rocks.            About     a quarter of a mile from the margin
 of the fjord, along the eastern half of the breadth of the                             valley,
 these mounds come in contact with the foot of the glacier, which
 is there pushed in a long tongue down the valley.                          The ice       over
 rides the moraine            heaps, ploughing them and pushing them                      over

    In the upper section, the glacier is shown overriding Us moraine ; in the lower, the smsT
 lake with floating ice intervenes between the end of the glacier and the moraine. In each «c-
 tion //marks the level of the fjord.
 On the west side of this prolongation                     of the glacier, the          ice   is
 separated from the moraine mound                     by  a  small lake, of which          the
surplus       waters find        their way seaward by cutting through                      the
moraine.         Like Loch Skene and many lakes still existing in                         Bri
tain, this sheet of water is formed by the dam of rubbish                            thrown
down by the glacier across the valley.                      It is full of fragments of
ice, which break oil' from the parent mass, and float across to the
north or lower side, where they strand on the moraine heaps, and

 gradually melt away.        Tlte smaller pieces, however, often find their
 way into     the stream by which      the lake discharges itself, and are
 then carried down       into the fjord.     From the mean of several         ob
 servations taken with the aneroid,          I estimated the surface of this
 lake to be abont 25 feet above the level          of high water in the fjord.
We had no means of measuring its depth, yet, from the slope of the
glacier, it may be inferred that the bottom of the ice is probably
lower than the level      of the  sea.
    Proofs that the glacier was once much larger than it is now, may
l>e  well seen on the west side of the valley, a little above the lake.
The shelving slopes of the            mountain      for  several hundred     feet
upward     have been    shorn smooth, grooved, and striated, and every
polished     hummock of rock is loaded with huge fragments of stone,
and heaps       of earth and angular rubbish.           Here, as at every gla
cier we   visited, the glaciation of the rocks was exactly similar, down
to the   minutest detail, with that of the coast and outer islets, as well
as  with that of the Scottish glens and sea-lochs.
    But the feature which most interested us was the relation                  of
this large     glacier of Fondalen to the marine deposits of the loca
lity.    The foregoing sketch (fig 4.) shows that the high terrace so
 marked along the sides of the Holands Fjord enters this valley, and
 extends on the western mountain side, at least, as far as the foot of
 the  glacier.    Hence the gravelly plain and the moraine mounds that
separate     the glacier from the fjord       are overlooked    on  either   side
by a   raised sea-beach.      In examining attentively the nature of the
material    of which the mounds nearest the glacier were composed, we
were   struck with its difference from the loose, coarse character of
the   ordinary moraine rubbish,         and its resemblance       to the upper
honlder-clay      of Scotland.     The glacier is pushing great        noses   of
ice into and over those mounds, so that freshly exposed sections are
abundant.        The deposit is a loose sandy clay or earth full of stones,
among which the percentage of stiiated specimens is not large.
The larger blocks of gneiss and schist appeared to us not to occur in
this clay, but to be tumbled down upon          it from the surface of the gla
cier.     We had hardly begun to look over a surface of the clay, ere
we   found fragments of shells, and in the course of a few minutes
 we picked up several handfuls,        chiefly   of broken pieces of Cyprina
 Itlandica, but including also single valves of Astarte rompressa, <fc.

We even took out two or three fragments which              were  sticking       in
the ice of the glacier.      These shells are not peculiar to one          spot,
but occurred more or less abundantly        across the valley.
    From the nature of the material of which these mounds              consist,
and from the occurrence of marine shells, it became evident that                we
were    looking not merely upon ordinary moraine heaps— the de
tritus carried down on the surface of the ice and discharged upon
the bottom of the valley.        The glacier was engaged in ploughing
up the sediment which had been formerly deposited in the valley                 by
the sea, and on the heaps of earth and clay so formed were thrown
the gravel and blocks brought down by the glacier.              In   short,     we
saw here     actually at work  a process  of excavation, by which it hail
l,een conjectured     that the marine drift was removed from certain
valleys in the Uritish Isles.*
    We made two attempts, both unsuccessful, to climb to the                 vast
table-land of snow from which these glaciers are fed. But we                 sui
ceeded    in reaching a point from which a good view of the seemingly
boundless undulating plain of smooth snow could be obtained.                  We
ascended the ridge that separates the two glacier valleys just                 de
scribed.     After leaving the raised beach of Fondalen, with its           mas
sive erratics, we climbed a steep slope, clothed with a thick            brush
wood     of birch, mountain-ash,      and  dwarf-willow,      and    luxuriant
masses     of ferns, bilberries,  cloudberries,   juniper,   rock-geranium,
 lychnis, &c.     The   beech trees are often a foot or a foot and a-haif
in diameter at the base, and are the building material used               at the
 hamlet of Fondalen below.        These trees, at the height of 1320          feet
above the sea, still often measure a foot across at the bottom,          and 15
or 20 feet in height.      At this height, and even considerably          lower,
there were large sheets of snow on the 12th of         July,   and these       in
 creased in number and depth as we ascended.          The birch     trees   grow
smaller     and more stunted the farther they struggle           up the      bare
 mountain ridge, until they become mere bushes.             The willows,         in
 like manner, dwindle down till they look like straggling               tufts    of
 heather, though still bearing their full-formed catkins.                   At    a
 height of 1690 feet, these stunted bushes at last give place to a
 scrub of bilberry, mosses, and lycopodia.          The mountain consists

 of gneiss, sometimes             massive and jointed, sometimes        fissile  and
 flaggy, with a strike           towards W. 15" S.       The extent to which the
 higher portions have suffered from the disintegrating effects of the
weather        is remarkable.         The gneiss is split up along its joints
into     large blocks, which lie piled upon each other in heaps of
angular ruin.           We noticed one or two          masses   which   differed in
lithological character from the rocks around; these may possibly
have been         ice-borne      from some of the neighbouring eminences.
On    reaching      a  point 2700 feet above the fjord, our further passage
was    arrested      by a narrow, shattered,         knife-edge   of gneiss, along
which       it was impossible to advance.          But from this elevated point
we could judge of the general aspect of the great snowy table
land of the Svartisen, which was sloping towards us, while the two
glaciers were spread out as in a plan beneath.
     The branch of the Holands Fjord, which opposite to the hamlet
of   Fondalen, strikes off to the north-east for seven or eight miles, is
bordered on the south side, and closed in at its further end, by a
 range      of steep, almost precipitous, wulls of rock, the summits of
 which are on a level with, and indeed form part of the great table
 land.       Here,   as  in so many other parts      of Norway,   we are reminded
 that the      fjords  are, after all, mere    long sinuous trenches, dug deeply
 out   of the edge of a         series of elevated plateaux.      And, looking up
 to  the crest of these dark precipices, we            see the end   of this snow-
 plain     peering over, and sending a stream of blue glacier ice down
 every      available hollow.         We counted seven of these tiny glaciers,
 exuding like tears from under the snow, and creeping downward
  under the sombre         cliffs of gneiss. None of them comes much below
  the  snow line, and none, of course, reaches the sea. The largest of
  them is near the end           of the fjord, and appears as a broken, crevassed
  mass     of ice, moulded as it were over the steep hill side, and, when
  seen     from below, seeming           about to slip off and plunge      into the
  fjord.      Fragments of it        are continually breaking away, and rolling,
  with    the noise of thunder, and clouds of icy dust, down the shelving
   sides   of the mountains.           These glaciers are, for the most part, the
   icy drainage      of the snow-field.        But there   are one or two   lying in
  corries, and quite detached from the main                snow-field, though pro
   bably connected        with it in winter.
      We left this delightful fjord not without regret, and catching

again   the coasting     steamer at Melovaer,         proceeded    northwards.
Between Melovaer        and ltodo, the higher mountains have wonder
fully craggy and spiry outlines, only their lower parts showing
ihe smoothed contour of glaciation. But where the coast hills
sank, as towards a fjord or bay, the ice-moulded               forms could     be
traced to a greater height.        To the north of Bodo, the contrast         be
tween   the sharp weather-worn          peaks above, and the flowing ice-
worn hummocks aud         hill sides below, is singularly startling. Prin
cipal Forbes, who gave a characteristically faithful drawing to illus
trate this feature, places the upper limit of glaciation at from            1500
to 2000.*      Wo should have estimated it to          be considerably    lower.
Through narrow kyles and intricate sounds, reminding one at every
turn of detached portions of West Highland or Hebridean scenery,
the steamer slowly wound its way, and then across the Vest Fjord
to the  Lofodden Islands.         The weather now unfortunately         proved
unfavourable     for geological     observation.      In sailing through      the
Rafte   Sund,    we saw what        looked    like moraines at the      mouths
of  some  of the valleys, and the lines of moraine terraces continued
as marked as ever.       Well ice-worn rocks were also observed at           the
openings of some of the valleys, but we were rather impressed with           the
general ruggedness and absence of glaciation            among the Lofoddens.
   To the north of Tromso lies the island of Ringvatso, noticed by
Mr B. Chambers.f         The moraine which he describes as damming
up the   circular sheet of water, whence the island takes its name,
really coincides with the line of the higher of the two strongly
marked terraces or sea-margins of this part of the Norwegian coast.
It  thus illustrates  the history of the moraine and terrace, below          the
smaller   glacier at Fondalen.          It  was  further interesting to    mark
that the glacier of Ringvatso,        partially hidden under snow,       lies in
a  hollow or corry surrounded with precipices, and quite cut ofTfrom
any snow-field.      The accumulation of snow in the corry itself must
thus be sufficient     to give rise to the glacier.       In looking    at this
island,  I was again    forcibly reminded of the history of the glaciers
of Tweedsmuir      and Loch Skene, where, on dimples of the hill tops,
and in deep cliff-encircled recesses,        there must have gathered      suow
enough to form streams of ice, which caught and carried on their

surface the piles of rubbish and huge blocks of greywacke that now
form the moraines of Midlaw, and dam back the waters of Loch
Skene.          A large         snow-field is not necessary for the production of a
glacier that may form comparatively extensive moraines.*
  The south-western side of the Lyngen Fjord is formed by                                a mass
"f high ground, which shoots up steeply from the                               sea to a height
of 4000 feet             or more.         Every hollow and cliff is smothered with
snow,      which descends in straggling streaks and patches almost to
the edge       of the water. We sailed up the fjord                    for some miles, and
had a      full view of this truly magnificent coast                   line.     We counted
from ten to twelve                   small glaciers   nestling in separate comes, and
also      two or three on the north-eastern                  side.     There    was here the
same      evidence of the formation       of glaciers in small independent
hollows         of   the mountains, quite detached, at least in the summer,
from any large snow-field.
 We halted at the island of Skjaervö (lat. 70°) for the purpose of
making an excursion across the Kvenangen Fjord and up the
Jokuls Fjord, to            see the       glacier which   was said to reach the level         of
the     sea.f    The metamorphic rocks among which the Jokuls Fjord
lies,     are for the most part of a flaggy quartzose character. Some
times,      especially where they                  are most fissile,   they are violently
crumpled.            Parts of them          pass   into hornblende rock and actrnolite
schist.         Their average strike is on an east and west line.
                                                              They
are     much jointed, and yield freely to the action of the weather.
Hence, a rough                  and angular      surface has very generally           replaced
the     ice-moulded outlines, though these still                 here and there remain.
   * North Wales     presents a number of illustrations of this remark, such as Cwm
Graianog, Cwm Idwal, &c. (see Professor Ramsay's Glaciers of North Wales).
   t This glacier was noticed by Von Bueh, and is mentioned by Principal
Forbes.  When we visited it, I was not aware that a brief account of it had been
given in vol. ii. of " Peaks, Passes, and Glaciers," second seriet. Mr J. F. Hardy,
 the writer      of that description, started overland from Talvik on the Alten Fjord,
 and reached       the Jokuls Fjord below the glacier, to which he ascended by boat.
 Like my own party, he did not climb the glacier, but he seems to have re
 garded it as connected with tho snow-field above.   Though I did not succeed
 in ascending the rugged cliffs, I had no doubt that tho lower glacier, from its

the  Jokuls Fjord) in sheltered places where wave action            cannot    be
supposed ever to have been very strong.           As the date of   these rock-
terraces probably goes back into the glacial period, it occurred              to
me   that they may have been due in large measure to the                effects
of the freezings and thawings along the old '' ice-foot," and           to the
rasping    and grating of coast ice.        Such, too, may have      been lbe
origin of the higher horizontal rock-terraces of Scotland.

     At the   headof the fjord the terraces disappear along the steep,
bare   sides of the mountains.     A moraine mound of loose mbtii-h
and large blocks lies on the west side, and extends a                             little   way into
the fjord, pointing towards           a   similar ridge         on the opposite side, as
if   both were parts of       a   curved terminal            moraine.           The      view from
this ridge is singularly imposing.                 The sombre precipitous                mountains
sweep      upward from       the edge of the water, seamed                             everywhere
with streaks and sheets of snow.                    Down      even to the beach                    these
snow-drifts         lie; and it gives     a   vivid impression of the high lati
tude of the place, that even in                July    there should be deep masse*
of snow overhanging tangle covered rocks, and undermined by the
wash of the waves. Over the crest of the mountains, at the head of
the fjord, we see the edge of the great snow-field of the                          Jiikuls Fjeki,
and stealing down from underneath, the snow comes a broken, shat
tered mass of glacier ice, broadest at the top, and narrowing down
wards    till its point disappears in               a deep    cliff or ravine, perhaps                     a
third of the way down from the surface of the snow-field to the                                      sea.
The eastern part of this glacier seems plastered us  were over              it.                       the
forehead of the mountain, and                 is   ever sending off fragments                      down
the dark precipice below.            Indeed, the whole glacier                    is   in constant
commotiou, cracking, and crashing, and discharging masses of                                          ice
and snow, which pour over the black rocks in sheets of white dust,
with   a    noise like the unintermitted thunder                       of   a   battle.            These
ice-falls     are    in large     measure          intercepted         at the      point           where
the    glacier      disappears     behind      the     side     of the ravine.                     They
seemed,     indeed, to collect in the ravine, and to slide down through
it; for at its lower end             a second         glacier      begins,        and expands
with the expansion of the hollow in which                          it   lies,     till   it   reaches
the edge of the fjord, where      may be       it                  a    quarter          of   a     mile
broad.      This lower glacier appeared to me not connected with                                     the
snow-field,      but   a   true glacier remanie, deriving its materials                              en
tirely from the avalanches of snow and                   ice that pour down upon its
surface from the precipices overhead.                   It   has   a   white, or dull          green
ish white colour, varied           with well-marked              dirt-bands.             The       slope
of its surface       was judged     to be     fully   20° or 25°.           A     few longitudi
nal crevasses make their appearance along the middle of the glacier,
and a little further down, the transverse crevasses increase                                  in   num

lar rente,    becomes a tumbled         mass  of ruin.      Last summer these
cliffs of   granular loose textured ice in some places overhung the
waves.      But the dark rock was likewise seen peering out along the
water's edge, underneath         the ice, which does not push its way out
to sea  in a mass, but ends abruptly where         it meets the water.        From
these   icy walls fragments and large slices break off, and fall either
on   the margin of rock or into the fjord, which i8 thus covered
with    hundreds of miniature icebergs, slowly drifted downwards
against wind and tide, by the surface current of freshwater.                   This
process    is called "calving" by the natives, and               so   great is the
commotion sometimes produced, that according to the information
collected by Von Buch, the Lapp huts along the margin                        of the
fjord   are sometimes      inundated by the waves propagated              outwards
from the     falling  masses.      The floating fragments of ice look like
little models of Arctic bergs;         their forms   are often    singularly fan-

 tastic ; they may    be seen   shifting their position, and even capsizing,
 *s  their submerged parts melt away ; some of them carry stones
and earth on their surface ; and many are aground along the margin
 of the   fjord, and rise and fall with the tide, or the ripple of the
 waves.      We passed two or three' which were from 8 to 10 feet
 Iong, and rose from 3 to 4 feet out          of the fjord.      Our boat grated
 against    several, which seemed        only  a foot or two in size, yet the
 shock    of the collision shewed how much larger               was    the portion
 concealed    under water.
     To the east of the upper glacier           the snow-field      sends another
  icy stream down the face        of the shelving precipices which descend
  into a  higher valley.      We could hear the roar of the avalanches
  even  when the glacier itself became hidden behind the intervening
  spur of the mountain.         From the rocky declivities of the Jokul's
  Fjord also, stones were        heard and seen bounding from point               to

  point in their descent towards the long heaps of debris at the            bot
  tom.    In short, in this lonely uninhabited spot, the activity            and
  ceaselessness    of the wasting powers of nature come before the           tra
  veller with   a  memorable impressiveness.       The wide snow-field      that
  seems to   lie  so  sluggish and still among the distant mists, is          yet
  seen to be   in slow but constant motion, pushing its ice-streams            to
  wards the valleys, and grinding down the hard rocks over which it
  moves.     Frosts, ruin, and springs      have scarped the shoulders of
 every mountain,       and poured long trains of rubbish       down its   sides.
  And   if this  can be now done under the present climate of Norway,
 how much       more powerful     must the abrasion      have been when        the
 ice, in place of being arrested on the brow of the mountain,              filled
 up the fjord, and pushed its way into the Arctic Sea.
     From the     open mouth    of the Kvenangs Fjord, in the passage be
 tween Skjaervo        and the Jokul, the outline of the neighbouring
 land is well seen.       The  steep, serrated ridge   of the Kvenangs Tin-
 derne shows its tiny glaciers nestling in corries both on its northern
 and southern       sides.   The sides of the Kvenangs Fjord           are ice-
 moulded and striated in the direction         of the inlet, and its    islands
 are   only large roches moutonnies.        In looking    back at the moun
 tainous tract of the Jokul's Fjeld,       we see  that it is another    snowy
 table-land jutting out as a       promontory into the Arctic      Sea, deeply
 trenched with long, narrow fjords, and pushing glaciers down every
 glen and hollow that descends          from the plateau of snow.
    We visited the north-western          and northern sides of this snow-
 field, boating up the Bergs       Fjord to the hamlet of that      name, and
 after ascending to its glaciers,       continuing our excursion       by   boat
 into the Nus Fjord.        (See fig. 5.) In ascending the South Bergs
 Fjord,    we found the gneissic and schistose rocks polished and
 striated from east to west, which is the direction of the inlet,            and
in turning into the North Bergs Fjord, which runs nearly at a
right angle to the other, the striae were seen to turn out of the
Lang Fjord and bend northwards through the northern limb of the
Bergs Fjord.         At the hamlet of Bergsfjord these ice-mouldings
are especially     well shown, and there,     as  well  as along   many    parts
of the fjord, occur lines of rock-terraces, often strewed with quanti
ties of angular blocks.       Two of the most marked of these horizon
tal bars have an elevation        of about 50 and 150 feet       respectively.

Behind the hamlet the ground slopes up to a point about 250 feet
above the sea, beyond which lies the mouth of a valley that runs
 up into the heart of the mountains.                  'We climbed the terraced
slope    leading to this recess, and found that the lower half of the
valley is occupied by a lake about a mile long, and said to be 30
fathoms deep.          It lies in a rock basin, and the rocks around its
margin Bhow that they have been powerfullyabraded byice. We were
told that three weeks before our visit this lake was solidly frozen
over ;     great sheets of snow, indeed, still descended to the water's
edge, and were melting away under the glare of a fierce July sun.
At the far end of the valley mounds of angular rubbish, cumbered
with huge blocks of stone, stretched from side to side, while over
 head two glaciers came out of the edge of the snow-field, and hung
 down     the steep mountain side —the longer one almost reaching the
 bottom of the valley. Here, too, the ice was ever breaking up and
 crashing down the precipices in clouds of snowy dust. The debris
 of ice gathered into talus heaps below, like the cones de dejection at
 the foot    of  a winter torrent.
      From Bergsfjord we continued             our   boating    voyage down the
  fjord, and found fresh        proofs that    a  vast body of ice, descending
  from the      lofty Jokuls Fjeld,      had    moved northwards       along the
  length    of the inlet.     Every promontory was beautifully smoothed
  and    polished   ; while the grooves and striae slanted up and over the
  projecting bosses of rock, as they do in Loch Fyne and the other
  western sea-lochs of Scotland.          Round the headland at the mouth
  of the Bergs Fjord we turned eastward, and soon passed the mouth
   of the  Ulfjord.    We could     see that, at the    far end of that inlet, the
   snow of the great table-land       moves outward to the edge of the dark
   precipices    which encircle     the Ulfjord,     and actually forms on the
   crest  of these precipices     a white   cliff, from which, of course, ava
   lanches are constantly      falling.   Yet the under part of this snowy
   cliff is not snow, but ice, as shown by its blue colour contrasting
    with the whiteness of the upper layer, which is snow.             At the foot
    of the precipice     a glacier,  derived probably in part, like that of
    Jokul's Fjord, from the ice-falls from          above,   creeps towards, but
    does not reach, the bottom of the valley.          Continuing our eastward
    journey we saw the same terraces       still skirting the hill sides, now   as
     green platforms   of detritus loaded with angular blocks, and now as

 struck here,     as  in other parts of the Norwegian coast, with the
 greater freshness of the ice-markings near the sea-level, when
 compared      with those higher up— a difference which is likewise
 very noticeable in the west of Scotland.
     The Nus Fjord is about six miles long, and lies between the
  Ul fjord and  0.x fjord.    Its margin is terraced bj the same horizon
 tal lines  so constant in this region.      Its south-western side presents
 a  singularly arctic     scene.    A  range of deeply cleft and embayed
 crags and precipices, plentifully streaked with snow, rises up to           the
 edge of the snow-field,        which, as usual, presses  down every larger
 valley in   a stream   of blue ice.     Eight or ten distinct glaciers    may
 be counted,    of which at least three descend from the snow-field.
 The others lie in corries detached from the snow-field, though                in
 some cases connected with it by nearly perpendicular streaks                  of
 snow.     Here, as in the Ulfjord, the edge of the great sheet of snow
 which covers the table-land may be seen ending off abruptly               as a
 cliff upon the crest of    a dark precipice   of rock, and from the    colour
 of the lower part of the cliff, it is plain that from pressure             ami
 motion, the under portion of the snow sheet is converted into              ice,
 and as ice, reaches the verge of the table-land,          where it breaks
sharply off, and sends its ruins to the bottom of the precipice under
 neath.    There the debris, mingled with the winter snow, is            anew
 converted into solid ice, and creeps downward as a glacier.
    At the head of the fjord, on the south-east side, the mouth of             a
 valley which terminates         inland at the foot of  a glacier is blocked
up by an old moraine.           Behind this rampart of detritus the     valley
spreads out as an alluvial plain, evidently at one time a lake formed
 by the moraine barrier at the foot.         The moraine itself is   strewed
with enormous angular blocks of rock, beside which the huts of a
miserable Lapp encampment look like mere pebbles.               The    side of
this moraine facing the fjord is cut by the 50 foot beach.            On   the
opposite side of the fjord a valley, at the head of which           a glacier
comes down from the            Snee-fond,   opens upon the shore, and         is
curtained across by a terrace, the surface of which is mottled            with
a number     of irregular concentric      mounds.    We had not an     oppor
tunity of examining these, but they seemed to be moraine heaps
left by the glacier when it came down to the fjord.            They vividly

recalled the        singular concentric            mounds that overlie the terrace at
the mouth         of the old glacier valley of the Brora in Sutherlandnhire.
    We walked along the north-east side of the fjord, and found the
rocky    declivity terraced with old sea-margins, which ran along like
ancient and ruined roadways.                       They occur up to perhaps 200 or
250 feet     above the sea-level, and are cut in the hard rock.                        They   are
covered with loose blocks, partly derived from the rocks around, but
probably       in part also transported from a higher part of the valley.
On the     beach we met with well ice-worn bosses of gneiss, slipping

 In   each case the rocks            are    beautifully smoothed and grooved, and
 show    that the ice which moulded them moved down the length of
 the inlet.        To the north and east of the Jokuls Fjeld the ground
 becomes      lower, and descends wholly below the snow-line.                          The hills
 that bound the           Alten Fjord, instead of rising into serrated peaks,
 like the higher tracts to the south, have a well ice-worn aspect, and
 recall the hills of Cantyre,                  or the scenery of parts of the lie-
  brides.      Indeed, the whole of this northern district of Norway, from
  the Alten       Fjord to beyond the North Cape, has the smoothed out

 line which further southward is found only on the lower zone of             the
mountains.*       It  seems   as if  a sheet of ice, descending from         the
south, had overriden all the fjords here and the comparatively               low
hills between them, and had advanced northwards                 to the Arctie
Sea.
     In fine, this short excursion     into the Northern part of Scandi
navia, furnished us with abundant proofs that the glaciation of               the
west of Norway was produced by a mass of land-ice, of which                   the
 present glaciers are the representatives.         It likewise confirmed,      in
a most impressive       way, the conclusion    which has gained ground so
rapidly within the last few years, that the glaciation of the Scottish
 Highlands, as well as of the rest of the British Isles, is in the main
the work, not of floating bergs, but of land ice.            This   conclusion
may, indeed, be regarded as demonstrated beyond all cavil                 by the
ice-marks of Norway.         Much good work might be done by trying
to work out a detailed      comparison of the glaciation of the Scandi
navian peninsula with that of this country.           More especially would
it be of importance to ascertain how far the glacial deposits of the
two countries can be compared.          Doubtless the drift-covered       slopes
of Sweden, and those of the east and centre of Scotland, must               have
many geological       features in common.        It  will perhaps     be found
that some of the difficulties which our Scottish           drift  presents are
explained     by the more extensive       deposits of the north, while the
latter may likewise suggest new explanations             of phenomena,      sup
posed to be already sufficiently intelligible.
       2.  On the    Third Co-ordinate Branch of the Higher
                   Calculus. By Edward Sang, Esq.
     The object of the paper was to point out that the               theory of
variables has a third branch, bearing to the Differential and Integral
Calculus     a relation  somewhat analogous to that which the            theory
of Logarithms bears to Involution and Evolution.
     In the theory of Functions there are three connected              variable

                    of Edinburgh,     Session 1865-66.                    557
quantities,    viz., the Primary,    the Function,    and the Derivative.
When the relation        between the primary and the function       is given,
the discovery of the derivative belongs to the Differential Calculus.
When that between the primary and the derivative is given, the
function is found by help of the Integral Calculus.          And the gene
ral problem      to find the primary when the relation         between the
function and its derivative is given, belongs to     a third branch, which
may be called the Calculus of Primaries.
   It was stated, in the course of the paper, that, by help of well-
known artifices, problems involving the first derivative or the second
derivative can be converted into problems of integration, and that
thus the first two chapters of the Calculus of Primaries are, as it
were, abstracted ; but that, whenever the order of derivation is
higher than the second, the equations cannot          be transformed     so as
to be rendered integrable.

1. On the Laws of the               Fertility of Women.          By   J. Matthews
                                     Duncan, M.D.
  This paper was            a sequel    of   a paper read to the      Royal Society,
and published         in the 23d volume of the " Transactions."                That
                    " On the Variations of the Fertility and Fecun
paper was entitled,
dity of Women, according to age;" and among other conclusions
therein announced,           was one    to the effect that fecundity, or          likeli
hood of child-bearing              after marriage,      increased from the earliest
child-bearing     age       till   about twenty-five, and thereafter gradually
decreased.       In   the present paper, the laws regulating such fertility
after marriage are demonstrated.                  The chief data on which the
arguments for these laws are based                are derived from an analysis        of
16,301 families, in connection with which entries were made in 1855
in the public registers for Edinburgh and Glasgow.
   The fertility of marriages in Scotland is shown by the reports                     to
the Registrar-General              to be about        4-64 children to a marriage.
But this statement is of no physiological value, since all marriages
are included in   comprising those at all ages and of all durations,

exact, ia got by dividing the number                  of married     women of child-
bearing   ago by the number               of legitimate children born, all          in the
game year.         It   is thus found that every 3'55 wives, aged from fifteen
to forty-five, add one to the population
                                      annually.
  The fertility of all marriages in Edinburgh and Glasgow that
were fertile in 1855 is found to be 3-7 children to a marriage.
The fertility of fertile marriages enduring for the whole child-
bearing period of life is shown to be on an average ten children to
a marriage     ;   and as the average interval between successive births
is about twenty months, fertile women, living in wedlock, from fif
teen to forty-five, are fecund for about seventeen years.
  The fertility of persistently fertile marriages, lasting during the
whole child-bearing period of life, is shown to be at least fifteen
children to a marriage.    Persistently fertile wives, taken                        at any
duration of marriage, are found to have born at the rate of                         a   chilJ
very nearly every two years.
  It   is shown that, at any epoch in married life, the average                         num
ber of a fertile woman's family is one-third of the number of                           years
elapsed since her marriage, and that the number                      of a   persistently
fertile woman's family is one-half of the number of years                          elapsed
since her marriage.            These      numbers vary according          to the     age of
the wives at marriage —               a circumstance       which     is   subsequently
explained.
  The average interval between marriage and the birth of a first
child is shown to be seventeen months.  Inclusive of this period,
the interval       between the births of successive children is twenty
months.  In average families, the first four children succeed one
another more rapidly than the next six — that                  is,
                                                  on to the tenth.
But in large families,             or those above ten, the children, from                 the
first, do comparatively            hurry after one another with brief            intervals.
    Fertile women, married at different ages, have an amount of fer
tility which decreases as the age at marriage increases and this             ;
greater total  fertility arises from the greater continuance or per
sistence in fertility of tho younger married.    Women married                                 at
higher and higher ages have shorter career of fertility.
                                          a              This per
severance in fertility explains why the women married from fifteen
to twenty years         of   age   have   a   greater fertility than those        married
from twenty to twenty-five,            who have the highest fecundity or                like

 lihood to have children, and specially a greater probability of being
 fertile than those married from fifteen to twenty.
     Wives who are persistently    fertile are more  fertile the older they
 ,were at the time   of marriage.    In  other words, the older a woman,
destined to be fertile, is at the time of marriage, the greater       will   be
 her fertility so long as it lasts.     The fertility of   a woman old at
marriage is greater than that of a woman young at marriage               ;  yet
the total fertility    of women married       young   far exceeds that of
women married when elderly, reckoning for both sets equal dura
tions of marriage, and all within the child-hearing period        ;  because
of the younger     a far larger proportion are fecund, and because the
younger have a      far longer continuance of fertility.
    The increasing frequency of twin-births as age advances is ex
plained by this law of increasing intensity of fertility as age
advances.
    Women married        when   elderly have been supposed by some
authors to have a     special postponement of the generative orgasm, to
enable them to bear children beyond ordinary periods.            But this is
shown     not to be the case, by the circumstance        that most women
child-hearing at very high     ages are already mothers     of considerable
families.

genera of substances, and within which the changes characteristic
of these genera take place. Thus the carbon acids contain the

      3. Note on the Compression of Air in an Air-bubble
                 under Water.        By Professor Tait.
   In an air-bubble of moderate dimensions the pressure is very little
greater than     that of the atmosphere ; but, as the difference of
pressures  within and without a bubble is proportional to its curvature,
it appeared to me possible that the so-called solution of air in water
might be due in some degree to the extreme compression of the
air when divided     into small bubbles invisible perhaps even under
the microscope.
   For a rough attempt at a solution, let us assume air to follow
Boyle's law for all pressures, and suppose the common formula
to hold  for the smallest bubble.
   Both of these assumptions are probably far from correct — the first,
when the condensation of the air is great    ; and the second, when the
dimensions of the bubble are so small as to be comparable with the
greatest distance at which molecular forces are sensible.
   If R  be the radius   of the sphere which the contained air would
occupy at the pressure of the atmosphere p0 ; r the radius of the
bubble,  and  p the pressure inside,
Eliminating p by the help of the first equation,
   Now, by experiments      on the rise of water in capillary tubes, it
                                   —2T
is  found   that   the  value  of      is, roughly, -0001 inch, if T  be
                                    Po
the tension per   linear inch, p0 the pressure per square inch.    From
the smallness of this quantity it appears that unless K be very
small, the second term of the above cubic is of little consequence,
and  therefore the dimensions of the bubble are little altered.

     But   if R   be very small          the second term is of more importance
than the first.         The following         are rough approximations                        only : —

An air-bubble          whose radius          is '00001           inch, which is about                    the

tains air compressed to 11 atmospheres only.
     When the bubble is detached from the fluid each of its                                     surfaces
contributes its share to the excess of internal, over external                                       pres

     Little is gained towards a closer approximation                                      by applying
analysis such as that of Laplace or Gauss to this question.                                         If we
express by <f'(r) the law of molecular action as depending on the
distance, we know merely that         insensible for sensible values
                                                <f,   is
of r.      The complete solution of the problem can, no doubt.be given
by   a   direct application of Laplace's process. Thus,    we write                      if

   Integrating between the limits 0 and o (a<r) for a, we have the
attraction of a uniform sphere on an external point.      Forming
the equation  of fluid equilibrium on the supposition that such a
spherical portion ceases to exert molecular force, we find the ex
pression for the pressure in the fluid at a distance r from the
centre    of the bubble.         This contains the following new functions
                                <o(r)=Jirdr   frdr Jlf'(r)dr,
and                             x (r)   =fir fr^r 1$ (r) ^r i
but, from the manner   in which they appear in the final expression,
it is impossible to determine the relative importance of the terms
containing       them.
     We   see,    however,      that the terms in            <a,   which     are    multiplied
by the curvature,           become somewhat less as the radius of the bubble
diminishes       — so that the calculated pressures given above                        are    pos
sibly too large.

     Elliptic Motion of Unresisted Projectiles.                               By Professor
     Tait.
     In " Tait and Steele's Dynamics of                      a    Particle,"       chap,     iv., a
number of geometrical              constructions       are       given, some possibly for
the  first time, connected with the motion of projectiles in para
bolic paths in vacuo.               I
                           have recently been led to remark that
most     of these propositions            still hold when we substitute, for the
uniform       action of gravity in parallel lines, the action                       of gravity
supposed      to be directed to the earth's centre, and to vary inversely
as the       square of the distance               from that point.           My excuse for
bringing      so simple a matter before the Society                   is,   that the proposi
tions are in themselves                 curious    and elegant,       and that      I      am not
aware     of their having          been      before mentioned.              A   very few ex
amples       will suffice to indicate the change of form required by the
more      general      assumed conditions.            The following may               be taken
for this purpose        :   —

 566               Proceedings   of the Royal Society
     1. The locus of the second foci of the paths of all projectiles
 leaving a given point, with a given velocity, in a vertical plane, is
 a circle.
    2.  The direction of projection for the greatest range    on a given
 line, passing through the point of projection, bisects        the angle
 between the vertical and the line.
    3.  Any other point   on the line which can   be reached at all, can
 be reached by two different    paths, and the directions  of  projection
 for these are    equally inclined to the direction    which gives      the
 maximum      range.
    4.  If a projectile meet the line at right angles, the point which
it strikes is the vertex     of the other path by which it       may     be
reached.
    5.  The envelop of all possible paths in a vertical plane        is  an
ellipse, one of whose foci is the centre of the earth, and the       other
the point of projection.     (In the simpler case this is a parabola.)
    The proofs of these propositions    are extremely   simple.     Tims,
let   E be the earth's centre, P  the point of projection,  A  the point
                                    A
which the projectile would reach if fired vertically upwards. With
centre E, and radius EA, describe a circle in the common plane of
projection.     This corresponds to the common directrix of    the para
bolic paths in the ordinary theory.       If F be the second focus of

 any path,   we   must have EP + PF constant, because             the axis major
depends on the velocity, not the direction, of projection.              Hence (1)
the locus of    F  is the circle    AFO.      Again, since,   if F   be the focus
of the path which meets           PR in    Q, we must have       FQ   = QS; it is
obvious that the greatest range Yq is to be found by the condition
Qq = qs.    0 is therefore the second focus of this trajectory, and
therefore (2) the direction of projection for the greatest range on
 PR bisects the angle APR.            If  QF = QF = QS, F and           F  are the
second foci of the two paths by which Q may be reached ; and, as
                        -
 ^ FPO = FPO we see the truth of (3).                  If Q be a point reached
by the projectile when moving in               a direction    perpendicular to
PR -we      must evidently have        PQF    = ^   PQF =       SQR = ^ EQP ;
i.e., EQ passes through F'.          This  case is represented      on the other
side of the diagram — where        f'g = gh=fg.      The ellipse whose second
focus is   / evidently      meet   Pr   at right    angles  :  and that     whose
second focus is     /' has   (4) its vertex at g.      The locus of      q is evi
dently the envelop of all the trajectories.           Now
                          P3=P0 + O?=PA + O2,
                            Eq=Ea-sq~ EA-O9.
    Hence
                             P?+E?=PA + AE,
or (5) the envelop is      an ellipse, whose foci are     E and P, and which
passes through A.
  5.  Od the     Fairy Stones found in the Elwand Water near
       Melrose.         By Sir David Brewster, K.H., F.R.S.
   On the banks of the Elwand Water, which runs into the Tweed,
about two miles above Melrose, there             is a picturesque glen called
the Fairy Dean, which has become a favourite place of resort, from
its association    with the incidents in           "The Monastery" by Sir
Walter     Scott.    It  has acquired      an  interest   of  a  different    kind
from certain mineral concretions          which have received the name of
Fairy   Stones, from     their being     found in that     part of the rivulet
which runs through the Fairy Dean.

568                  Proceedings     of   the   Royal Society
come subjects of conversation            at Abbotsford; and on one           occasion
 when   I  happened to mention          that singular stones were found in
the   Fairy Dean, Sir Walter Scott expressed                a desire    to see  them,
and to know how they             were formed.          I  accordingly sent       some
young persons to search for them in the bed of the rivulet,                     and   I
 was fortunate     in thus obtaining several specimens of great variety,
and singular shape, and showing, very clearly, the manner in which
they were formed.
    It did not then occur to me that             a description      of   these stones
 would    excite   any other than        a   local   interest  ;   but, some     years
ago,   when     in company       with    our distinguished countryman Mr
Robert     Brown,      the Botanicorum facile Princeps of Humboldt,
he   asked me       to   accompany     him to his museum, to                see some
remarkable       mineral     productions      which      had been      sent to him,
and which he had not seen before.                These     minerals     were exactly
the same     as the     Fairy Stones from Roxburghshire, but                 none of
them were so       remarkable, either in their shape or their                 mode of
formation,    as those     which  I now present to the Society.
   The Fairy Stones         are generally of       a grey colour,      like  common
freestone, but some        of them    are coated to the thickness of about
the seventieth of an inch, with a black substance, so soft as to                  pro
duce a black streak upon paper like            a crayon.
   These stones are generally formed of concentric                   layers more    or
less regular round a single centre, as in figs. 1 and 2, some of them

having the form of         a lens, ocasionally      so deep, as to be almost          a

round two centres, as in fig. 3        ;   in some     round three centres,       and
in others round many centres, as in figs. 4 and 5.

like the Lemniscates in biaxal crystals.

   In one  remarkable    specimen,    shown in fig. 6, the different por-

the appearance    of a fossil.

     It is obvious, from the inspection of the specimens on the            table,
  that the   Fairy Stones    are formed       by the dropping   of  water    con
  taining the matter of which they are composed. This is                 clearly
  shown in two of the specimens on the table, where the fluid            matter
  has been deposited upon fragments of whinstoue,            though   in one of
  these specimens (fig. 7) the deposits at AA are so deeply imbedded
  as to have the appearance of contemporaneous formations.
     When the stones have       a symmetrical      structure on the under       as
  well as on the upper side (as in fig. 8), it is difficult to understand
             Fig. 7.                                 Fig. 8.
 the mode of their formation,        unless we suppose that the deposit
 has been   made upon      a soft stratum of clay or sand, or any other
 material with which      the deposited matter will not combine, ami
 from which it may be easily separated.
    This difficulty is increased when the specimen has the form              of  n

    According   to a   rough   analysis,    which   Dr Dalzell    has been so
good as to make for me       ; the specific gravity of the Fairy        Stones
is 2-65, and their odour, when breathed upon, argillaceous.               They

effervesce with mineral acids, and contain the following ingredients
proportionally in the order in which they            are written  : — Alumina,
Silica, Lime, Magnesia, Oxide of Iron, and a trace of Manganese.
    The black coating on many of these stones, which is too minute
for analysis, and which may be easily removed, is very remarkable.
If it  is not carbonaceous      it must   be an  aluminous deposit, when the
particles of the aluminous         solution    have become so small as to be
unable to reflect light.       This supposition will not appear unreason
able   to those who have seen the surfaces of fracture of certain
specimens of quartz, where the separated fibres are so minute                   as
to be incapable      of reflecting the lowest order of tints in Newton's
scale.     The specimen of quartz in which              I  observed this very
remarkable      phenomenon       was,  I  believe, exhibited to the Society.
 Mr Haidinger      afterwards     found a less perfect specimen        in which
 the surfaces   of fracture were equally black.

   The following Communications were read : —
1.  Report on the Hourly Observations made at Leith Fort
   iu 1826 and 1827, by Direction of the Society.                     By Sir
   David Brewster, K.H , D.C.L.,            F.R.S.,    &c.
   In 1823 the Royal Society established           a register   of hourly ob
servations of the thermometer at Leith Fort.              They were made by
the non-commissioned       officers of artillery, and were continued       for
four years, from 1824 to 1827 inclusive. A report on these obser
vations for the years 1824 and 1825 was published in the tenth vo
lume of the Society's Transactions ; but from causes to which it is
unnecessary to refer, the report on the observations             of 1826 and
1827 were not then published.
   The great interest which was attached to meteorological obser
vations, but specially to those made every hour, has induced the
author to publish the results which he has obtained from the
original registers in the Library of the Society.
   The agreement of these results, with those obtained from the
observations   in 1824 and 1825, is very remarkable.
      2. On a   New Property of the Retina.               By Sir David
                Brewster, K.H., D.C.L., F.R.S., &c.
   In  a paper on hemiopsy,*      the author had shown that the parts of
the retina affected with this disease were susceptiblo of luminous im
pressions and insensible to visual ones, and that the light by which
they were impressed was         derived  by irradiation from the adjacent
 parts of the retina.   The parts of the retina affected with hemiopsy
 were, however, so    small, so irregularly distributed, and the pheno
 menon of such short duration, that        it  was  difficult to study it and
 deduce any satisfactory     results.
   From an accidental        observation    the author     discovered  that a

574                   Proceedings   of the Royal         Society
portion of the retina of his right eye, though the vision of the                    eye
was perfect, was       actually blind or insensible to visual impressions,
while it was so       sensible to luminous impressions, that no spot of
the slightest darkness or shade was seen in the field of vision                   when
directed     to the sky or any extended              white surface.      When        the
image of a bright object, or of thfc setting sun, was received                          on
this portion of the retina, which was about the twenty-eighth                       part
of an inch in breadth, it was wholly invisible, and therefore                           the
light with which it was impressed must have been derived by                         irra
diation from the adjacent parts of the retina, or from those parts                       of
it which underlie        the insensible     part.     But for this property             the
patient would constantly        see a black         spot disfiguring the         aspects
of nature, and ever reminding him of his misfortune.
   The author mentioned a temporary affection of the                      same eye,
observed thirty years ago, on which             two lines, radiating from               the
foramen centrale, were absolutely black.
        3. On some       Laws of the Sterility of Women.                   By
                        J. Matthews Duncan, M.D.
     In this paper absolute sterility is held to mean the condition                       of
a woman who, under          ordinary favourable         circumstances      for    breed
ing, produces no         living or dead child, nor any kind of              abortion.
Sterility is held to mean the condition of              a woman who, under              or
dinary favourable        circumstances      for breeding,    produces no living
and viable        child, or adds not one to the population.                 Relative
sterility is held to mean the condition of             a woman who, while               she
may or may not be absolutely sterile, while she may or may                        not be
sterile,   is,   under ordinary favourable conditions for breeding,               sterile
in relation      to the circumstance       of time, or, in other words,           in    re
lation to her age and the duration of her married life.
                                                                                         111
     The sterility of marriages     in our population         is   estimated       as
per cent.
     The sterility of wives, married        at ages from     15 to 44 inclusive,
is   shown to be 15 per cent, or about         1    in 6J.
     The absolute sterility of wives           may be held         to   approximate
closely to the sterility of wives      ;   for to the data used in calculating
the sterility of wives there would only have to be added the                      wi'W

                      of Edinburgh,      Session 1865-66.                      575
bearing dead        children only, or abortions        only,  or both (and the
number of these is probably            inconsiderable),    in order to get the
absolute sterility of wives.
   Sterility varies according to the         age  of the woman at marriage.
About 7 per cent, of the women married from 15 to 19 years of age
are  sterile.     Of those married from       20 to 24 years      of age,   almost
none    are sterile.       After 24 years of age, sterility reappears and
increases progressively with the age at marriage.
   Expectation of sterility begins after three years' of marriage, for
only 7 per cent, of fertile wives commence child-bearing after that
period has elapsed.
   The probability of a woman's being sterile is soonest decided at
the ages at which the probability of fertility is greatest.
   Relative sterility is sooner arrived          at according      as the age at
marriage      is greater.      This is merely the converse of the law of
continued       fertility,  that  being   greater   according     as  the age    at
marriage is less.
   Expectation of relative sterility commences after three years of
cessation of fertility, and increases as more time elapses.
i. On certain Points in               the Morphology of Cleft Palate.
    By John Smith, M.D.,                F.K.G.S.E.        Communicated by
    William Turner, M.B.
    In  cases of cleft palate with alveolar fissure, the maxillary bones
 are,  during infancy, not only ununited, but, in general,                  if  not
 always, more widely separated from one another than in the natural
 condition.      This has      been  frequently   observed in such        cases  as
 come     under the care of the surgeon,            although    little  attention
 appears to have been           bestowed upon     the fact beyond        its mere
 casual    mention.      Measurements,     however, have been        lately made
 by   Dr Engel,*      showing that the difference between certain fixed
 points — such as the two infra-orbital foramina, the nasal processes
 of the upper jaw, &c., is very well marked,             when the distance is
 measured in a healthy new born child, compared with one having
 a cleft palate.

  576                Proceedings    of the Royal       Society
     In   these cases,   he  describes   the width of the nostril on            the
  affected side as greater, the bridge of the nose less arched, and              the
  distance between the two orbits       increased.       In all cases, the    lower
  ends of the nasal bones project further forwards             than in healthy
 new-born children.       The nasal processes of the frontal bone in bila
 teral cleft palate are shown by him to be broader, the width             between
 the tubera frontalia to be increased      ; and besides the two eyes being
 further removed from each other, the form and size of the orbits are
 altered ; and both in bilateral and unilateral cases are seldom equal
 in size.     The minute details of    a case are also given by him where,
 associated with double cleft palate, there was a great addition               both
 to the breadth      and depth of the basis cranii in the ethmoid               and
 orbital portions of the frontal region       : a  condition he       considers    to
 bear a    " causal relation" to the occurrence of cleft
                                                                palate.
     The increased breadth of the anterior part of the bead               he con
 siders as necessitating      a greater    distance     between     the superior
 maxillas than can be filled up by the development                 of   the inter
 vening structures.      And the cause, again, of this increased           breadth
 of the head he believes due to various               circumstances,      such    as
congenital      hernia  cerebri, dropsy of the third ventricle, or            ante
rior cornua of the lateral ventricles,        or excessive development of
the anterior      cerebral lobes.   Owing to such distension within             the
cranium of the embryo, he shows the parts on each side of                       the
palatal fissure to be, in the young subject, not only deficient in              the
middle line, but further asunder than in the normal condition.
    These    circumstances    become somewhat          more interesting      if  we
contrast them with what appears to occur in the adult.                   Here   the
transverse distance      between the palatal        sides of the upper right
 and left anterior bicuspids will, in an ordinarly well-formed jaw,               be
 found to measure from one and an eighth to one and a quarter of                  an
inch.      The measurements afforded at the       same spot,    in sixteen   adult
cases    of cleft palate, of which I have collected casts, are somewhat
less   than this; and in others, of which         I  have not preserved a re
cord, the same peculiarity was observed.             Among the       cases noted,
the measurements at the point already described, are as follows;
the canines of the opposite sides — which, by the way, are                 always
present in these cases — being in some, of course, much closer                than
the bicuspids.

In six cases where the intermaxillary bones seemed altogether ab
sent — probably cases originally of double cleft — where these bones
had been     removed     by the surgeon — or of others where they had
never been developed      —
                       1 case    measured     fths of    an inch.

inch.
    In ten cases of simple cleft palate alone, or of cleft palate                  com
bined with only unilateral fissure —
                  1 case  measured fths to        f ths   of an inch.

giving   an average measurement            of |ths of an inch.
    I have selected the inter-bicuspid point of measurement,                   as being
that in which the relative width in the infantile, compared with the
adult jaw, seems to vary least.            The increase by expansion of the
jaw in this direction amounting             to very little comparatively from
infancy to adult    age   in the healthy subject.
    It would thus appear that while in the infant there is abnormal
separation, in the adult there occurs abnormal approximation                      of the
 parts on each side    of the fissure.         To    a certain extent     this approxi
mation of parts may be fortuitous           :  a misdirection       of growth depend
ant upon the absence of the mesial structures,                     while the superior
 maxilla is becoming, as age        advances —elongated             downwards by the
expansion of the antrum.           But   as the same approximation             seems to
occur even where only a           partial fissure exists, — the cleft being
 limited to the palate, while the maxillary arch is throughout                     com
plete, — there is reason to conclude that it is in                   some  measure to
be considered as a reparative,          or rather         an   ameliorative    effort on
the part of nature towards remedying the defects existing. And such
 a view becomes practically interesting, as pointing to the probability
 of a certain amount of assistance likely to be obtained in this man
 ner, by a  judicious delay in surgical interference with such                  cases.

   Further, the perfect development of the true inaxillaries,                         indi
cated by the invariable presence of the canines, is significant                      of the
lesion being one chiefly affecting             or originating in the interposed
structures;     and in the more characteristic                  cases    the disease      no
doubt is best marked             in its effects       on   the intermaxillary        bones.
Without homologating any hypothesis advanced on such subjects,
this proclivity to irregular or arrested development in these bones
— the    haemal spinesof the nasal vertebra, as described by Owen—
the haemapophyses of the catacentric vomerine sclerotome, as
described by Goodsir, — seems to afford a confirmation of the theory,
that the tendency to return to a manifestation                    of what       have been
described     as   archetypal        characters   ;    or, on    the other        hand,    to
assume an erratic development,                becomes greater as we depart            from
the vertebral      centrum.        This part of the subject is one,               however,
which,     without mature elaboration              of many as yet undetermined
facts bearing on         it,   cannot be      treated in either    positive or an
                                                                    a
exhaustive      manner.         But in   a      further acquaintance with those
great principles of morphology,               of late beginning to be         revealed     in
the vertebrate skeleton, we may expect that the nature of malfor
mation and metrological             disease    will    be presented      in   a   new and
more intelligible light.

     the Brain of the Chimpanzee.                          By Wm. Turner, M.B.,
     F.R.S.E.
     The late Professor         Gratiolet, in his elaborate and beautifully
illustrated memoir, " Sur les Plis Cerebraux                     de 1'Homme et des
Primates," attaches great weight in his differential diagnosis                               of
their cerebral characters to the presence or absence of one or more
members of         a   series of convolutions,         which    he designates        as the
pits de passage.        When present, these convolutions                bridge over       the
external      perpendicular        fissure of the          hemisphere,     and     connect
the parietal       and temporal        with the occipital         lobes.      By    various
anatomists      in     this country they are called        bridging, connecting,
or annecteut         convolutions.       In    the brain of the Chimpanzee M.
Gratiolet states that the first bridging convolution                       is    altogether

wanting ; that the second is present, but concealed under the opercu
lum of the occipital lobe; that the third and fourth are superficial.
    In his  comparison of the brain of the Chimpanzee         with the brain
of the Orang, he attaches great importance to the absence of the
first bridging convolution      in the former, and to its presence in a
well-marked     manner in the brain of the latter ape.        In his general
resume   (p. 98) of the mode of arrangement of the second bridging
convolution in the brains of the monkeys of the old world, he states
that in them      it is constantly concealed under the operculum, and
never comes to the surface      ;  whilst the third and fourth connecting
convolutions     are always superficial.
    All anatomists who have inquired into this subject since the pub
lication of M. Gratiolet's memoir agree with him in recognising             the
superficial position of the third and fourth, and the concealment of
the second    bridging convolution within the perpendicular fissure in
the   brain of the Chimpanzee.          But with regard to the complete
absence    of the first bridging convolution in the brain of this          ape,
evidence has been advanced which proves that M. Gratiolet's state
ment,   although correct in some specimens — as, for example, in the
 one  which he described and figured — yet is not universally appli
 cable.
     Thus Professor    Rolleston states* that     on the right side of the
 Chimpanzee's brain, in theOxford University Museum,awell-marked
 superior bridging convolution        came, for a considerable    part of its
 length, nearly or quite to a level with the lobes it connects           ;  and
 Professor   Marshall describesf on the right side of the brain of a
 Chimpanzee, which he dissected, a rudimentary superior connectitig
 convolution    of very small size passing from the outer margin of the
 lobule of the second ascending convolution outwards, and then
 bending inwards and backwards across the perpendicular             fissure to
 join the occipital lobe.
     Whilst dissecting the brain of     a young male Chimpanzee,        which
  was given    to me about two years ago by my former pupil,                 Mr
  Alfred Pullar,   I obtained  evidence of a greater extent of variation
  in the arrangement of the convolutions        in this  ape than had up to
  that time,  I  believe, como under the notice of anatomists.             Thin

Chimpanzee              figured        by Professors Gratiolet and Marshall, that                   no
special description                   is   necessary.     In all,    the olfactory sulcus          was
well marked             ;    and in two specimens              a    triradiate     arrangement      of

and  in all the specimens the fissure of Rolando (R) extended up
wards as far as the great longitudinal fissure, and formed with its
fellow the sides and apex of a V-shaped figure.       The lobule of
the  second ascending parietal convolution of Gratiolet (postero-
parietal lobule — Huxley) reached as far back as the external per
pendicular fissure (parieto-occipital fissure), and presented a sub
division into an internal (5") and external (5') portion ; each of
which again, though somewhat more strongly marked in B than in
A and C, exhibited signs of sub-division into secondary lobules.
The bent or angular convolution (pli courbe) (6                        6) varied       some
what in its arrangement in the three specimens. In                     A it   commenced
much lower down in front of the Sylvian fissure than in                            B   and C.
The length of its ascending part, from its commencement to the
apex of the fissure, was in the first named       inch, whilst in the
others it was considerably less. In all three brains it was partially
broken        up into smaller convolutions              by secondary fissures.          In A
its descending part was directly prolonged into the middle temporo-
sphenoidal convolution, as in the brains figured by Gratiolet and
Marshall.   In B and C its continuity superficially with this con
volution was broken by a cross intersecting fissure.                          Not only in
the brain of the Chimpanzee, but in those of all the                        apes   in which
the various parietal convolutions              are differentiated,    the fissure which
separates the angular convolution                from the second ascending parietal
and its posterior lobule is so clearly marked that it deserves to be re
cognised by a distinctive term ; but as none has as yet been applied
to     it,
        I      would suggest that        it   should     be called   the intra-parietal
fissure       {IP).      This fissure commences anteriorly behind the fissure
of Rolando, at first ascends almost parallel to                      it,   and then runs
backwards and joins posteriorly               the parieto-occipital fissure.
      In     the brain    (C) the external perpendicular           (parieto-occipital)
 fissure      (E P)   on each side was unbroken             by the passage across of
 either the first or second bridging convolutions,                   and the opercular
 edge was as sharp and well-defined                as   in the brains figured by Gra
 tiolet and Van der                   But in B, whilst this arrange

 ment existed in the right hemisphere, the left exhibited an im
 portant variation. From the posterior and outer angle of the left
 postero-parietal         lobule   a   narrow,    but    clearly-marked       convolution
 (a,   fig. 2), half an inch long and J-th of an inch wide, arose.                         It

passed almost transversely          inwards, and joined the supero-internal
angle of the occipital lobe close to the longitudinal fissure.                      It  was
superficial in its entire extent,           and consequently           bridged       across
the external perpendicular           fissure.    From its position and connec
tions it must be regarded as              the homologue of the superior con
necting convolution         of Gratiolet.       This brain, therefore,          furnishes
another example to those already recorded by Professors Rolleston
and Marshall of the occurrence of this convolution                       on one side      of
the brain of the Chimpanzee,             though     in the opposite         hemisphere
to that found in their specimens.

   In    the brain   (A)  the amount of variation was still more strongly
marked.        On the right side the postero-parietal lobule gave off                 from
its outer and posterior part a superficial convolution                 (a, fig. 1)   T^jtb?
of  an inch broad,     which     was almost immediately            joined    on its   deep
surface by a slender process from the superior                    angle of the         bent
convolution,      the place of junction being concealed by the                     imper
fectly defined occipital operculum.              This convolution,         then,   passed
across     the external     perpendicular      fissure, inclined        inwards, till    it

reached   the longitudinal fissure of the cerebrum, of which it formed
the   boundary for half an inch, and then joined the inner end of the
first occipital convolution.        A  secondary fissure passed        for some
distance     into its substance before it joined the occipital lobe.
Throughout its entire extent it formed           a very   distinct, superficial,
first connecting convolution,       almost as well marked, indeed, as that
figured and described by Gratiolet as so remarkable and distinctive
a  feature   of the brain of the Orang amongst the         apes.
    On the left side no first connecting          convolution     existed  ; but
from the superior angle of the bent convolution,             where it became
continuous       with the descending limb, a narrow convolution (B,
fig. 1), £th of an inch wide, arose.          At its origin it was concealed
by the occipital operculum ; but almost immediately                  it became
superficial in the parieto-occipital     fissure, passed almost transversely
inwards, and joined the inner angle of the superior occipital con
volution close to the longitudinal fissure.         The length of its super
ficial portion was f ths of an inch. From its origin it was evidently
the second bridging convolution, and in its superficial position it
exhibited an arrangement such as has not before been recognised
in the brain of the Chimpanzee, and which Gratiolet, indeed, had
not met with in any of the numerous brains of the Old World apes
which he had examined.
    The convolutions       of the occipital lobe presented no variation in
arrangement       calling for special remark.      They were joined, in the
usual way, by the third and fourth superficial bridging convolu
tions proceeding from the temporo-sphenoidal             lobe.
    In the    disposition   of parts about the Sylvian fissure, the brains
B     and   G corresponded closely to those figured by Professors
G-ratiolet and Marshall, but in the brain A an arrangement prevailed
such as has not yet been described in the brain of the Chimpanzee.
 The anterior lip of the Sylvian fissure       was as usual sharp and       well-
 defined,     but  the   posterior  marginal    convolution      (pli temporal
superieur), instead of forming the posterior boundary of this fissure
 in its entire extent, became gradually narrower as           it ascended, and
 at the same time receded from the surface.             As  a consequence, its
 upper end was entirely concealed, the Sylvian and parallel fissures
 became continuous        superficially with each other, and the ascending
 and   descending limbs of the bent convolution formed the anterior
     vol. v.                                                         4 o

remarkable superficial continuity of these fissures might                          be apt, on
a hasty glance, to lead to the impression                      that the Sylvian         fissure
mounted much higher on the outer surface of the hemispheres                                than
is usual, but what at first sight seemed to be the upper end of                             the
Sylvian was really the upper end of the parallel fissure,                           as was at
once proved by separating               the ascending         and descending          parts of
the beut convolution            from each        other, when the upper concealed
end of the Sylvian fissure became visible.                      A similar      arrangement
to that just described has been stated by Gratiolet (p. 29)                             some
times to occur in the brain of Cercopithecus Sabceus.
   The median or central lobe (Island of Reil) consisted on the left
side of five short and almost straight convolutions, none of which
possessed      any great size, but on the right side only four                             were
visible.     The fissures which separated these gyri from                         each other
were short and shallow.    The gyri radiated outwards and                                back
wards from the locus perforatus anticus. The most anterior                             joined
superficially the inferior frontal gyrus               ;   the rest were separated           by

  The hrain           A     is the only specimen on the inner and tentorial sur
facesof the hemisphere of which I have been enabled to study the
arrangement of the fissures and convolutions. The calloso-margi-
nal sulcus         (i i)    commenced      anteriorly in front of the anterior end
of the corpus callosum, and extended                      uninterruptedly backwards.
When opposite               the commencement            of the posterior third of the
corpus callosum             it bifurcated, — one branch ascended and reached the
margin of the great longitudinal fissure, the other ran backwards
and     joined the internal perpendicular                  fissure.    From the calloso-
marginal           sulcus     a few secondary         fissures extended     upwards and
downwards into the marginal                   (17) and callosal (18) convolutions.
   The internal perpendicular                (occipito-parietal) fissure (K), slightly
convex forward, was continuous                       at the upper margin of the inner
face    with the external            perpendicular         fissure, whilst inferiorly, it
joined the calcarine sulcus             (I     l).   Proceeding from its posterior lip,
two connecting              convolutions       ran at once into the fissure         ;   one,    (*)
deeply placed, except at its origin, mounted upwards and outwards,
and joined the deeper aspect of the postero -parietal lobule.   Its
concealed part exhibited an indication of subdivision into two gyri.
The other, or inferior annectent gyrus                    (f) partly   projected into the
perpendicular, and partly into the calcarine fissure, and joined the
lower portion of the quadrate lobule.  The dentate sulcus (to to)
was well-marked, and at its lower end was prolonged into the re
curved part of the uncinate gyms (19).  The calcarine sulcus                                   (1   1),
which possessed              great depth, commenced posteriorly in              a   bifurcated
extremity, the two limbs of the forks being almost equal in length.
It    extended forwards close to the dentate sulcus, but did not quite
join      that the callosal (18) and uncinate (19) gyri
        it,   so                                                                     were con
tinuous with each other in front of its anterior extremity.                             Within
the calcarine sulcus two small                  gyri were found.        One sprang from
the floor   of the fissure, and evidently corresponded to the calcarine
 gyrus,   described by Mr Flower as so well developed in the brain of
 Cercopithecus       ;      the other and larger arose from the internal occi
 pital lobule (25) which formed the                    roof of the sulcus   ;   it   projected
 towards       thr calcarine gyrus         :    anteriorly   it   became continuous            with

586                 Proceedings       of  the   Royal Society
the quadrate lobule, and the inferior annectent               gyrus, and     poste
riorly it turned round the upper branch of the sulcus, and joined
the supero-occipital gyrus.             The collateral sulcus (n n) reached
almost the entire length of the tentorial aspect of the hemisphere,
and although       neither    so deep,    nor extending     so  far back     as the
calcarine sulcus, yet reached in front almost as far as the tip of              the
temporo-sphenoidal        lobe.     Some small secondary fissures       proceeded
from it.     The internal occipital (25) and quadrate (18') lobules were
well seen, and the latter was considerably            larger than the former.
    The three specimens of the brain of the Chimpanzee just described
prove that the generalisation which Gratiolet has attempted to
draw of the complete absence            of the first connecting     convolution,
and the concealment           of the second,       as essentially  characteristic
features in the brain        of this animal,       is by no means universally
applicable.     In only    one specimen did the brain,      in these  particulars,
follow the law which Gratiolet has expressed.                   As   regards    the
presence of the superior bridging convolution,                I  am   inclined    to
think that it has existed in one hemisphere, at least, in a majority
of the brains of this animal which have up to this time been figured
or described.*        The superficial       position   of the second      bridging
convolution      is evidently much         less  frequent,   and has as yet,        I
believe, only been seen in the brain (.4) recorded in this communi-
   * But few specimens of tho brain of the Chimpanzee have             as yet been
figured or described.    In  that figured by Tyson, only the base and an internal
view of the brain are given.     In the brains figured and described by Gratiolot,
:ind Van der Kolk and Vrolik, and in my brain (C) no superior bridging con
volution existed.    In the brains described by Rolleston and Marshall, as wi ll
as in the brains A and B now described, it is precisely stated that it was pre
sent in one hemisphere.       In the brain figured by Tiedemann (Thil. Tram.
1836), from a specimen in the Hunterian Museum, Loudon, it is apparently
present in the left hemisphere, though it is not referred to in the description ;
and from the drawing of a careful cast of the brain dissected by Dr Macartney
{Trans. Royal Irish Acad. 1843), it seems probable that the first bridging
convolution existed in his specimen.
   Addendum, May 5. — Since the above paper was read, a fine young male
Chimpanzee     has been purchased by Professor Goodsir for the Anatomical
Museum, tho brain of which I removed and examined.            In both hemispheres
the parieto-occipital fissure was unbridged, and the opercular edge of the
occipital lobe was as sharp andwell defined as in my brain (C), or in the speci
men figured by Gratiolet.

cation.     The a-symmetrical arrangement of the convolutions in the
two hemispheres       which previous observers have referred to in their
descriptions, is also well illustrated in these specimens.          The higher
differentiation of the cerebral convolutions in the Chimpanzee over
that of the lower       apes affords   room for a greater amount of vari
ability of arrangement in it than in them.           Hence, in depicting the
brain of this animal, just as in the representation of its face and
figure,   every drawing should       be  a portrait,   and every description
whilst embracing the great general outlines in which all the speci
mens     probably agree, should yet indicate the special modifications
in construction     exhibited   by the individual.
6.   On the Theory of the Refraction and Dispersion of                  Light.
     Part I. By Alfred R. Catton, M.A., F.R.S.E., Fellow of
     St John's College, Cambridge, Assistant to the Professor
     of Natural Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh.
    Supposing     the phenomena       of light to   be caused by the inde
finitely small vibrations of     a highly elastic medium pervading       space,
it is a simple problem       to determine the motion        of such  a medium
in vacuo, or in space, where matter does not exist, as in these cases
the problem      is reduced to the determination          of the motion of     a
homogeneous elastic medium.
    On proceeding,      however, to investigate      the motion of the ethe
real medium      in crystals, for the purpose of accounting for the phe
nomena of crystalline refraction,        the question arises, whether there
is an action between the material molecules and the etherial medium.
 In other words,     are the laws    of the refraction    of the ether within
 crystals, independent      of the existence of material         molecules,   so
 that the ether may be treated as a single            elastic medium,    or are
the phenomena       of crystalline refraction produced, wholly or partially,
 by a direct action between the material         molecules and the ether     ?
    It  is necessary, therefore, to consider at the outset, whether there
 are  any physical facts which throw          light on this question.       For
 this purpose the observations of Sir David Brewster, De Senarmont,
 Des   Cloizeaux, Mitscherlich, and others,          are discussed   at length
 in the paper.

588               Proceedings      of  the Royal Society
    The discoveries of Sir David Brewster show that the        optical pro
perties of crystals are connected with the arrangement          in  space of
the material     molecules of which they are built up.        Thus     when
the material molecules are symmetrically arranged with respect              to
three planes at right angles to another (as in the prismatic system),
or where there is only one plane of symmetry (as in the oblique
system), or none (as in the anorthic), there are two optic axes.
But when they are symmetrically arranged about one line as                 an
axis, there is only one optic axis which coincides with the axis            of
symmetry of the crystal.       In the cubic system, which is symmetrical
in every direction, every straight line becomes an optic axis.
   Again, in quartz and dextro- and laevo-tartaric acids (as              ob
served by Pasteur), the direction of rotation of the plane of polariza
tion is to the right or left according as the hemihedral forms which
occur on crystals     of   these  substances turn    to the right or     left.
Here, then, a want of symmetry in the arrangement of the material
molecules is connected       with   a want  of symmetry (so to    speak) in
optical properties.
    The bearing of the experiments of De Senarmont, Des Cloizeaux.
and others, is then discussed, and it is shown that, in general,
whenever and from whatever cause the arrangement of the material
molecules is changed, the optical properties are also changed.           The
influence    of heat and pressure on crystalline refraction         is well-
known.      Thus in a rhombohedron of calcite, increase of         tempera
ture alters the angles between the faces, making them approach
more nearly to     a cube, and at the same time the extraordinary          re
fractive   index  is increased.      A similar  observation  has recently
been made by      Fizeau in quartz.       From the facts brought forward
in this paper, it is concluded that the ether within all bodies is of
the same nature as       in  vacuo,   and that the optical   properties of
crystals are caused entirely by the direct action of the material      mole
cules on the ether.     Of course the action which the ether       exerts    at
a  given point within   a  crystal is not, as in vacuo, the same in    every
direction.     For in crystals of the prismatic system, the action of
the material molecules is different in different directions; in other
words, it tends to compress the ether more in one direction than
in another, and in consequence the resistance of the ether to           com
pression must also be different in different directions.

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1865-66.                            589
    The great defect in the theories of crystalline refraction hitherto
proposed,      viz., the theories of Fresnel, Cauchy, Neumann, Macul-
lagh,  and Green, is the neglect of the action of the material mole
cules.     In     these theories the ether within crystals          is supposed to
possess special        properties different from those which it possesses in
vacuo, such as possessing different            degrees of elasticity in different
directions     ;   the ether in every body being supposed to possess               an
elasticity peculiar to itself.         In  none of these theories are any con
siderations advanced to show how the ether might be supposed to
have acquired the special properties             which it is found necessary to
assume      that it    possesses,  in order that these theories may account
for phenomena.            So that, even if they were satisfactory in other
respects,     an important        desideratum     would   still  be left.    A    few
remarks are then            made on the question       whether the ether is a
continuous or discontinuous medium.                 In  the present paper the
general equations of motion are obtained on both suppositions.                     In
vacuo    the equations of motion           are known    to be of the same       form
whichever supposition is adopted.
    With respect to the molecular action between matter and the
ethereal medium, it is supposed to be sensible at only very small
distances.         That this is true, in general, for molecular forces, is
 shown by such facts as the following : — When a solid, as a piece of
 marble, is reduced to powder, no amount of pressure will make the
 powder again cohere into a solid mass.              Two   clean surfaces    of lead
 may be made to cohere, but not               if there is the slightest     film of
 oxide.      There     are a number    of other facts of the    same    kind.    The
 height    co  which the fluid rises, or is depressed, in       a capillary tube is
 independent of the thickness of the tube.              Also, to take the     case  of
 water — if      the thinnest film of grease be present in the tube, the
 water is depressed         instead of elevated, showing that the sphere of
 action of the molecular forces of the glass on the water is less than
 the thickness        of the thinnest     film of grease.     The strength of        a
 wire,   also, is dependent         only on its section.     Also,    if we take a
 crystal of Iceland spar, and reduce it by cleavage, or otherwise, to
 as small dimensions as possible, it is found that the crystals succes
 sively obtained are in every respect similar in their optical                   pro
 perties     to the      original crystal.      The portions      of the crystals,
 therefore, removed by cleavage, have no effect on the optical                   pro

590                   Proceedings         of the Royal Society
perties of the minute           crystal    ultimately obtained;         and as crystals
of quartz and other substances have             been obtained         of   almost micro
scopic dimensions,        but    still possessing all the properties                   of large
crystals of these substances, we see that the motion of the ether                              at
any point of a crystal           is only affected by the material                 molecules
which are within extremely minute distances of that point.
  Again, there is no dispersion of light in vacuo, or in                         space.       In
order that this may be the case, that              is,
                                          in order that                          rays of all
wave lengths      may be propagated with the same velocity,                        it   can be
shown that the action exerted by the parts of the ether on                                  each
other can only be sensible at very small distances.
   In obtaining       the equations of motion,            it   is   supposed that             the
motion constituting light          is   transversal to the direction of propaga
tion,    which   is   equivalent     to supposing        that the ether           is    incom
pressible with respect to the forces called into action                          in the      pro
pagation of light, or that the motion of the ether takes place without
change of density.
   The arguments in support of the hypothesis of transversal                                  vi
brations, to which Fresnel was led by physical considerations,
founded on the non-interference                of rays polarised            in    planes       at
right angles to each other, are so well known, that      not neces     it    is
sary to enter into their discussion.  Suffice  to say, that "if the
                                                             it

                 a                                     multitude       a                       of
curious and complicated phenomena, like                  a   thread through             a   laby
rinth,   be considered     to carry the stamp of truth, the claims of                         the
theory of transverse vibrations            seem but   little short of        those       of   the
theory    of universalgravitation" (Stokes "On the                               Dynamical
Theory of Diffraction," Cam. Phil. Trans., vol. ix. p.                           2).     As    in
other theories, the squares of the displacements                    of the   elements          of
ether from their positions of equilibrium are neglected.

 In   the absence, from illness, of Sir David Brewster, the chair
     was taken,       pro tern., by Professor Tait, on the motion of
     Professor Balfour.
    In delivering the Keith Medal to Principal Forbes, Professor
 Tait said — " The suddenness of this summons, and my consequent
 total want of preparation, may well excuse me            if I fall short of what
 is due to the Society          or to Principal      Forbes   on this    occasion.
 Nothing, however, could be more agreeable to myself than                   to per
 form such a duty to him who was my earliest instructor                      in the
 science   I  now profess.       Principal Forbes has already obtained          this
 prize, and has, during a long and active career of investigation,
 over and over again merited          it.   As one of his unrewarded          worts
which may be taken as a type of their value,               I   may merely men
tion his Theory of Glacier motion, which, in spite of ignorant and
invidious criticism, still remains the true statement of the observed
phenomena — all it pretended to be.

importance        in the deeper speculations of natural philosophy, but of
very great      practical value.    Other experimenters had given tolerable
approximations to the relative conductivities of different, metals, but
had   either not attempted, or had most notably failed, to measure the
conductivity of any one metal.               The problem which had thus
proved so       difficult has  been  first solved by Forbes.        The absolute
value    which he has found for the conductivity of iron is well guar
anteed for accuracy by the full and satisfactory statement of the
principle and details of his investigation,         which has been published
                                                                 o
          '
in the       Transactions.'     Its close agreement with Angstrom's sub
sequent      determination, by a very different method, also trustworthy,
proves    the agreement in the conductive quality of the specimens of
iron used      by the two experimenters;       but is not required to confirm
the results      of either.
    " The
              method     by which Forbes analyses the circumstances con
 cerned     in the transmission of heat along       a bar   of which one end is
 maintained        at a high temperature,      is remarkable,      no less for the
 ingenuity shown in its invention          than for the thorough and vigor
 ous  working out of the laborious processes of experiment and of
 reduction, both graphic and by calculation, which it involves. The
 manner in which, from that analysis, Forbes discovered the varia
 tion  of conductivity, due to variation of temperature, along the bar,
 is very striking.        The final deduction of the varying value, through
 a wide range of temperature, of the absolute measure of the thermal
 conductivity        of iron, constitutes  a very   important contribution to
 physical science."

     This communication         was intended     to  illustrate by experiments

unite     ;   and the process of cutting one into two or more.
  A statical investigation of the form of an unclosed film, blown
with coal gas, was given (the kinetic problem presenting very
grave difficulties), and the results were shown to be in accordance
with observation,         so far as the             eye can follow the       rapid change
which takes place in the neck of the film just before the                            closed
bubble is detached.
     Professor     Tait called attention to the exquisite manner in                  which
the molecular motions in the film may be exhibited by employing
the posterior surface of a large bubble as a concave mirror to                        form
a small        bright point from       a   beam of parallel rays, and receiving          on
a screen the  light diverging from this point after it has                          passed
through portions of the anterior surface.
   He also noticed that the spectrum of the reflected light                          shows
very effectively the phenomena of interference,                       supposed by Von
Wrede to account for the dark lines in the solar spectrum.
2.     On Functions with Recurring Derivatives.                             By Edward
                                            Sang, Esq.
     In   a previous     paper, it was pointed              out that the characteristic
problem of the third branch of the higher calculus, is to discover
the relation       between the primary variable                 and its function,     when
the relation        subsisting   between the function and its derivative                  in
known.          The present paper treats of the solution of the                   simplest
case      of this general problem, that in which the function is                  equal or
proportional        to its derivative.
   The proposition in hand is naturally divided into cases, accord
ing to the order of derivation : The first two of these can, by well-
known artifices, be brought under the dominion of the integral
calculus,       and their relations           can       therefore present nothing     new.
But for the sake of the continuity of the treatment, and of                         certain
relationships which otherwise could not have been so well explained,
they have been discussed in the paper.                       When   we    inquire into   the
nature of the function which is equal to its own first derivative,                       we
arrive        at the exponential           function, and at the basis of         Neperiun
Logarithms of this function                 e4,   the development    is

and      it is shown that the fundamental                 recurring functions of any
higher order,       as the   nli,   are      obtained by taking each n'h term of this
development.
    When each alternate term of the series for                           e'   is taken, we obtain
a  function which is equal to its own second derivative ; of this func
tion there are two varieties, according as the terms contain the even
or the odd powers of the primary.                         If the      value of the primary be
represented        by absciss®,         and the corresponding                    values of the func
tion be indicated        by ordinates, we obtain two curved lines, one of
which is the catenary, and the other, a line which may be called
the companion to the catenary ; these two liues do not meet each
other.
    If    we take each third term of the development of                                   e',   we obtain
recurring functions of the third order; of these there are three va
rieties, according to the term with which we begin. When the
values of these three functions                    are   represented by ordinates, there
result three curved lines which intersect                        each other, and           it    is   shown
that their intersections             take place on ordinates at equal distances
from each other, the lines being, as    were, plaited upon eachit
other. As the value of the primary   augmented, the interval be
                                                          is
tween the curves, as measured on an ordinate, generally diminishes,
and the three lines soon become so close as to be undistinguishable
in a drawing of ordinary size.                     For negative values of the abscissae,
the curves separate more and more from each other.                        The distance
between the ordinates, on which                        these intersections              take place,      is
an important feature of the ternary                           functions      ;    it   bears    a   certain
relation     to the circumference             of   a   circle of which the radius                is   equal
to the linear unit, and          is     susceptible of very easy computation.
    A    very remarkable property of the lines representing these ternary
functions     is   this, that   if  an equilateral            triangle        be placed in       a    plane
perpendicular        to the plane of the paper, and passing through                                     one
of the ordinates in such            a   way as that the three coi ners of the trigon
may have the points of the three curves                                for their projections;
and   if   the ordinate be supposed to be displaced                               along the line of
abscissao at a uniform          rate, the trigon               will turn round also with                  a
uniform      velocity, and, its side decreases                   or increases in continued

596                      Proceedings        of    the   Royal Society
proportion, according as the direction of the motion of the ordinate
is toward the + or               —   side of the absciss.
     When       each    fourth       term of the series for        e?   is taken,     we obtain
recurring       functions        of the fourth order; of these there                      are     four
                         into two groups according as they involve
varieties, distinguishable
odd or even powers of the primary.   The curved lines representing
the functions of the even powers accompany each other, crossing
and recrossing on ordinates at equal intervals,                         the middle line            be
tween them being a modification                    of the catenary.        The lines         repre
senting the functions with odd powers also accompany each other
on ordinates midway between those of the previous pair.                                   The     dis
tance between these ordinates corresponds                        to the value of                jt, the
ratio of the circumference                to the diameter of a circle            ;   and as the
computation          of this value is easily          made, we have a new determina
tion of   7r,   independent of the theory of the circle.                  The    intersections
of the curves of even with those of                   odd powers, are not on ordinates
at equal distances.
     The quaternary functions               are    notable on this account, that                    by
addition,       they gave the catenarian — by subtraction,                       the circular
functions.
     When       we     proceed       to the fundamental recurring functions of
higher orders,          we   find that the interruptions of the representative
curves no longer occur on equidistant                        ordinates, although           certain
compounds of them present the plaited                         appearance of the ternary
lines; and it is noteworthy, that then the loops widen                               as   we pro
ceed towards the + end of the line of abscissae.
H.   The World as Governed                        by Law,       'Ideologically             consi
                                 dered.     By    11.   S.   Wyld.
     Mr Wyld stated that               he considered         the philosophic          treatment
of this subject important,              as there existed a great amount of loose,
ill-digested opinion in the public mind regarding                          it,   and      possibly
also in the minds of many men of science.
   The first object of the paper to direct attention to the
                                                 is                                        fact     of
the existence of general laws, alike in the physical and                                   in     the
moral world      ;     to consider      these as designed for the benefit                   of    the

                        of Edinburgh, Session                18(55-66.                        597
human race;        and to enforce the duty of reviewing them as the ap
pointed paths to human happiness and progress.
     Mr Wyld showed that the doctrine is not only not necessarily
connected with what is called infidel opinions, but, on the contrary,
is far more naturally allied              with          the belief in a supreme Ruling
Intelligence.
     In   the prosecution of the subject, he first directed                        attention to
physical law, showing, in particular, in what manner he believed
the law of attraction to have operated in bringing about the present
structure of the earth, and to be operating in a similar way in the
case of some of the planets.
     Regarding the mental or moral world, the writer showed that the
entire social system was compacted, and kept in life and energy, by
virtue of the various appetites, desires, emotions, and passions by
which man is influenced.
  The conclusion to which the writer is led, in considering this
part of the subject  that     unwise and in vain to talk of re
                               is,       it   is
pressing the instinct which leads man to expect special instances
of Divine favour. The instinct      strong and universal one im
                                                   is   a
planted in us, doubtless for wise and useful ends.                            It   would     seem
the part of wisdom, then, rather to regulate than                        to   extinguish          it
                                                                                                   ;
and this     can   only   be done safely, by            showing that the laws           of  nature
are the special, just, and wise methods appointed                      by   the    Ruler     of   the
world     for   dealing with man, and as such, that they are to be re
verenced, submitted           to, and obeyed.
4.   Description of Pygopterus Greenockii (Agassiz)         with                        ;
     Notes on the Structural Relations of the genera Pygopterus,
     Amblypterus and Eurynotus.  By Ramsay H. Traquair,
     M.D., Demonstrator of Anatomy in the University of
     Edinburgh.  Communicated by W. Turner, M.B.
     In this    paper     a   detailed    description         is   given of        a   species of
Pygopterus {P. Greenockii) from the carboniferous shales of Wardie,
Mid-Lothian, which was named by Agassiz, but without any figure
or description, beyond the mention of the fact that the scales of the

  598              Proceedings     of the Royal      Society
 anterior   part of the trunk are higher than broad, a circumstance
 distinguishing it from all the other species of this genus.
    According to specimens exhibited by the author, the scales are of
 different forms on different parts of the body, being very minute,
  and nearly equilateral    along the belly    ;  the fins are large, and    the
 dorsal is placed so far back as to be nearly opposite the anal           ; the
 interspinous   bones of the azygos fins are well developed, and          there
 are traces  of vertebral apophyses, but none of vertebral bodies.            On
 the top of the head are shown the parietal, mastoid, frontal,             post-
 frontal, and prefrontal bones, with a single nasal forming a               pro
 jection above the mouth.        On the side of the head, the operculum,
 suboperculum, superior maxillary bone and lower jaw are distinctly
 recognisable,   with   a  large triangular      plate, covering   the   cheek
 above the upper jaw bone, and smaller            ossicles around   the orbit,
which is placed very far forwards.           The broad superior maxillary
bone is beveled off for the orbit in front, to a narrow point which
comes in contact with a small intermaxillary situated below the
nasal and prefrontal     bones.    The teeth are conical and of two      sizes,
large ones alternating with small.           The branchiostegal     apparatus
consists of numerous       narrow    flattened    plates,  and the shoulder
girdle shows the supra-scapular, scapular, and cnracoid bones, with
a triangular plate in front of the lower end of the coracoid,.analogous
to a similar plate in the recent Polypterus.
    A  comparison was made between the osteology of the head                   in
Pygopterus and in Amblypterus, showing the very intimate corre
spondence in the form and arrangement of the bones in those two
genera   ; and the appearances in both were then compared with               the
structure of the skull in the recent Lepidosteus          and Polypterus.
    The general structure of Eurynotus        was then noticed, and several
of its facial bones described, together with the peculiar rounded
teeth with which the jaws and palate are furnished.            The opercular
apparatus and superior       maxillary bone differ considerably in        form
from those in Amblypterus, and         still more marked is the    difference
in the shape of the teeth    ;  but the two genera agree in the form        and
arrangement of the branchiostegal         plates and in the general     struc
ture of the fins and scales.     A  specimen in the St Andrews      Museum,
shows distinctly that there were two rows of fulcral scales along           the
anterior edge of the dorsal fin, at least of Eurynotus.

    In regard to classification,     it  was   shown that Pygopterus and
Amblypterus must        be placed close together       in the   same  family of
                                             Vogt (Zool. Brieje II. Band b.

                                                  " Lepidoidei Heterocerci,"
with the addition of Pygopterus, Acrolepis, and their allies, formerly
classed   as   "Sauroidei;" the distinction between Lepidoids                and
Sauroids having been long ago shown to be artificial.                (Muller—
Ganoiden — Abhandl. Berl.        Acad,  der Wissenschaften, 1844.) As to
the position of Eurynotus, and whether it should remain with
Amblypterus and Palaeoniscus, or be transferred to the same
family with Platysomus and the Pycnodonts, as has been recently
Hone by    Dr Young (Proc. Geol. Soc. London, Feb. 1866), tho author
is  of opinion that for the present it should remain in the former
family, although considered as a member of the group of Palaeo-
niscidae,  it is certainly   a very aberrant form.

   F.L.S.      Communicated by Professor Allmau.
   The surface of the island is less richly supplied with animal life
than the ocean, and, indeed, with vegetable likewise.              The grass is
coarse and stunted, and even the           hill tops  are   boggy    ;  while     the
sea border has    rich crops of Fuci, Laminarite,       and other sea-weeds,
and harbours      hosts of animals, both vertebrate          and invertebrate.
The inhabitants     seem to take certain     of the circumstances in          which
they are placed to the best advantage.           Kelp is manufactured           from
the sea-weeds   ;  the drift-wood makes the framework of their                 hovel
roofs, and is applied, besides, to many other useful purposes; while
fishing is universal.       The soil, again, on the eastern side, with a
single exception, is cultivated with neither vigour nor profit, the
islanders   having    a tendency to be a        pastoral and fishing, rather
than an agricultural race.
    There  are few or no rock pools on the eastern side, but at Paible,
on the western, they are common, their rich vegetation                    affording
shelter to Cotti, Wrasses,       Shannies,   and Mysidae — animals           almost
totally absent between tide-marks on the eastern side. On the other
hand, the laminarian blades at Paible, beyond low-water mark, do
not seem to be so prolific in simple or compound Ascidians—
probably because the water is purer and more boisterous.                 At   Loch-
        * Every specimen Itereufter mentioned
                                                 was seen by the uutuur.

maddy the blades          of this sea-weed are covered with            a flocculent,
muddy     deposit, that appears to be favourable to Ascidian existence               ;
while at      Paible they      are   fresh   and clean,     there   being naught,
indeed, but      pure sand to deposit on them.
    The occurrence of inland seas affords             an  interesting variety      in
examining marine life. The most abundant animal species in
these is Littorina tenebrosa, which clothes the branches of the fuci
with its myriad examples, and abounds under stones;                  while swarms
of the young          of Rissoa    striata   and R. ulvce speckle         the green
Cladophora.          The common mussel clings by its byssus to the fuci
and stones     ;   but no large example was seen in such localities, either
living or dead.          The hand-net showed that Mysis            chamceleon    and
Idotea    tricuspdaia found amongst the sea-weed thickets                 both food
 and shelter     ;   and the ubiquitous         Gammarus      locusta,   and   other
 sessile-eyed crustaceans, lurked under the stones in thousands, as
 well as sported       in the water.      Carcinus   mcenas, as fierce and wary
 as   when    in purer water, was common.               Under the stones were
 numerous groups of the little Planaria ulvce. The sole representa
 tive of the swimming jellies was a small medusa, with four lilac
 loops,   like M. aurita.        Of fishes there were grilse, trout, young
 gobies,     and    rough-tailed sticklebacks.         It was strange to find,
 within forty yards of such an inland sea, a true boggy, fresh-water
 lake, where we had the bold contrast of the white water-lily, car-
  damine, sparganium, horse-tails, and confervae, holding the place
  of the neighbouring fuci, and marine alga?.              Instead of the marine
  fauna    before-mentioned,       glistening beetles skimmed the surface,
  water-boatmen,         dytisci   and    cyprides   the   depths,     pond snails,
  cyclades,   and leeches, climbed         the water plants, and annelids         and
  larvae  crawled in the brown peaty mud at the bottom.
      Of the Coelenterata, nine were got within tide-marks, the most
   abundant being Seriularia pumila.               Caryophyllia Smithii swarms
   at the verge     of low water    on   the eastern side of the island, being
   attached   to rather muddy stones that lie piled over each other, so
   «8 to form small      caverns, in which       the corals hang, grow upright,
   or project      horizontally;      they    feed voraciously      on   the   salpae.
   Amongst the anemones Anthea cereus attracts most notice from its
   curious arborescent habits on the fuci and laminarise of the creeks
   at low  water.

   The only Sertularian        found in profusion       on laminarian         blades
                            from deep       water   was 8. operculata, which
                            seemed     to thrive best on the west coast of
                            the island.      Adhering      to a mass of Tubu-
                            laria indivisa from the Minch            was a creep
                            ing stem, having        a series   of horny,      ringed
                            polyp cells, of a somewhat fusiform aspect,
                            with a short, smooth peduncle, the whole
                            having the appearance of a Campanularia
                            (fig.   1). They were only observed after
                            immersion in spirit, so that the tentacles of
                            the polyps could not be counted.            Pavonaria
                            quadrangularis       is  not    uncommon         in   the
                            Minch,      but   I    only got     a   single      muti
                            lated specimen.        Lucernaria aurkulata           was
dredged at Paible.         In all, thirteen      Coolenterata were         procured
from deep water.

   Thirteen Polyzoa were procured between tide-marks; and it is
curious to find that here Crista elurnea forms the pigmy forests under
stones, in place of the Sertularia pumila of the east coast of            Scotland.
A  very abundant Lepralia in the same             region is  L.   verrucosa.
   From beyond low-water mark there             were  thirty-six Polyzoa.          In
one instance, no less than three cups         of Tululipora patina         grew one
above   another.     CrisiJia    setacca was very abundant         on laminarian
roots, forming dense, snowy tufts.           More    than a third      (seventeen)
of the total number were Lepralias.             One of the richest        fields  for
these and other marine          productions    not destroyed       by drying     was

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1865-66.                            603
the   collection of Laminariae, chiefly from the Monich region, formed
at the kelp factory.           On a tuft of Tubularia indivisa from the deep
water   of the Minch, two specimens of Reiepora Beaniana occurred.
One   of these adhered to the test of an Ascidian in a position which
prevented     the coralline from following its usual law of having the
cells  only ou the concave side, since,          to accommodate        itself to cir
cumstances, the Retepora             had its cells on the convex side.           The
latter, however,        may be regarded only as a contorted            inner or con
cave side.       A small independent Retepora            on the same mass        pre
sented a    peculiarity in having its inner or cellular surface hispid
with rather stout, simple spines.              The apertures of the cells were
round,    with    a raised tooth on one edge,      like the cells of R. Beaniana.
The outer or smooth side in the various specimens is marked by
delicate white lines, which at first sight look like cracks.

    The island is peculiarly rich in Ascidiaus, thus affording              a marked
 contrast    to the eastern shores of Scotland,             where     the compound
 species,   and     a  few solitary ones under stones, are the only repre-

sentatives generally met with between tide-marks.            ApUdiumfalht
occurs occasionally      in masses  fully   an inch  across.    On touching
living specimens, the large aperture in the common test leading into
the internal cavity was sharply contracted.         A group of curious     ani
mals (Amourouciumf), elevated on long, clavate, hyaline peduncles,
and arranged round        a common centre, were also got under        a stone.
The truncated tips of the masses were carunculated, and the polyp?
of a bright orange hue during life. Numerous specimens of several
species of bright orange and reddish orange Leploclini abounded on
the stones and fuci    ;   and both Botryllus and Botrylloides were        well
represented, many having tadpoles in their masses.            A curious thin,
greyish-brown    species, and a bright ochre-yellow         one, occurred    at
the extreme verge of low water, both having glistening (as if var
nished) surfaces, covered with soft spiniform papillae. A Clavelina
(fig. 2) was got between tide-marks,           of  a clavated    outline,  and
                                    Fig. 2.
with  a hyaline  test.      At the upper part of the animal       a dull grey
ish, muddy mass capped the viscera; below this was a someffU'it
fusiform, flesh-coloured thorax, irregularly streaked with yellow
lines ; a swollen  bright reddish orange stomach succeeded, marked
by regular yellow bands, which on both sides presented a simfar
appearance, viz., two lateral lines corresponding         with   the  curve of

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1865-66.                          605
the region, and a central          one, the whole    having the shape of the
inverted Greek letter          u,, and resembling a crown.         The visceral
region dwindled         to a streak before reaching         the radiciform     pro
longations at the        base.
     The simple       Ascidians    were   represented    by  A. intestinalis, A.
eanina,     A.   mentula, A.scabra, and       A. aspersa.    Accompanying the
 latter were one or two hard, reddish species, that apparently could
 be classed      with neither.     From the deep water of the Minch           came
 several Ascidians, slightly adhering to each other by the extraordi
 nary debris of shells, mud, and corallines,            that surrounded      them,
 yet otherwise        solitary and distinct, like Molgula oculata.           Their
  orifices were situated       on separate fleshy papillae, the anal , having
  eight    streaks of crimson, with intermediate               pale lines ; the
  branchial somewhat larger and more prominent, but similarly
  tinted.     Molgula tubulosa was occasionally           met  with on muddy
  ground     (six fathoms) in Lochmaddy.            The papillae were greyish-
  brown ; and when placed in spirit, it speedily cast off its coating
  of mud and minute shell fragments.
      Cynthia rustica and C. grossularia           are  frequent  between tide-
   marks, but not at the extreme verge, for that seems rather occupied
   by sponges and zoophytes.           If  a stone   having its under surface
   covered with the former is turned over, death and discoloration                of
   the Ascidians s0on take place, although they remain in the same spot
   as  regards    the tide.    C. ampulla (?) was dredged in twelve fathoms
   on hard    ground;     it had a tunic covered with sandy hairs, with a
   clear space on which the two long pinkish apertures             were situated.
    A small specimen allied to C. tesselata was also dredged. On the
   test of a large A. mentula from the Minch were several examples
    of Cynthia Uistice, new sp. (fig. 3).           The largest were about a
    a quarter of an inch in diameter, globose, and hisped with branched
    bristles springing from papillae on a tough greenish tunic.          It differs
    from the    Ascidia echinata of Professor Forbes in having four divi
    sions  to its branchial orifice, in having no regularity in the arrange
    ment    of the bristles, and in their want of radiation.
       The countless multitudes of Salpa tpinosa and 8. runcinata, in
     both solitary   and aggregate forms, is also a noteworthy         fact.
        One   of the most striking features in the distribution of the
     mollusca (proper) of the island        is the abundance     of wood-borers,

606                Proceedings     of the Royal     Society
and the comparative absence of rock-miners.*              The  sole examples
of the latter lurked between stones that         had been fixed together by
a laminarian     root, in the interstices of the latter, on rocks, in      peat,
never in an independent tunnel.           The drift-wood,   again, is    almost
universally perforated by the Teredo, and many logs             are so honey
combed, that they are only fit for firewood, or the cabinet of               the
naturalist.     Teredo norvagica and T. megoiara were the two            species
observed.      The total number of mollusca (proper)         recognised      was
 145  ; of which     sixty-three were Lamellibranchiate,            eighty-one
Cephalophorous,      and one Cephalopodous.

    Between tide-marks      the prevalence     of Trochus    zizyphinus      was
characteristic.     The women and children           still gather     Littorina
littorea for sale.     The inherent      apathy   of the islander      prevents
him taking due advantage of the occurrence of Mytilus                 cdulis  in
the creeks   ;  and he is to be seen fishing with a scrap of limpet           or
cockle, rather than trouble himself to procure the former for              bait.
The somewhat rare Tapes decmsata is met with in the sand at low
water. Fisnrella reticulata and Emarginula reticulata are abundant
under stones in the same region. Doris proxima is common on tlie
floating blades of fuci at low water ; and most of the Nudibranchs(l"

Lochmaddii : — Body, rather more than                    a quarter     of    an   inch in
length, pale, translucent,               and   faintly pinkish on dorsum from
viscera. Tail, stretching             a little beyond the sloped branchiae, pale.
Oral   tentacles,    pale,   rather short. Dorsal tentacles, generally carried
erect, thick, coarsely crenulate, barred with pink, and white at tips.
Eyes, distinct.           Branchice,      at first small    and club-shaped,         then
becoming long and slightly fusiform ; processes bent inwards over
the dorsum, and tapered towards the tips. Colour, pale pink, grained
with red     ;  tips with white grains and a few red, capped by a trans
lucent point.         It  is an active and hardy nudibranch,            swimming       on
the surface, elongating            its foot, and throwing       it into   a goove.      It
deposited* pale pink            ova, as a simple band in transparent             mucus.
   In   the. loch,       the hard       and muddy ground          abounded in small
cockles,    Ve1ius ovata,      Crenella decussata,      Corbula nucleus, and occa
sionally the rare Lima subauriculata.                The most common univalves
brought in by the dredge (from four to fifteen fathoms) were Trochi,
Lacunae, Rissoae, and the curious species resembling Akera bullata,
but possessing two distinct            eyes  ; the latter animal preferring a hard
bottom,     not far from mud.               Thracia distorta and       dead     valves of
Thracia     convexa were got in company              with Tellina donacina,         Venus
casina, and Artemis exoleta in the same region.                    The valves of the
Pecten maximus, cast on shore by winter storms, are still used by
the   natives      for skimming          milk    and   scooping     butter.       On the
 western shores of the island the pretty Phasianella pullus is com
 mon.    Sepiola atlaniica was dredged also at Paible, on sandy ground.
A purplish-brown            variety of Elysia viridis, with many pink and
blue specks, was frequently              got at Lochmaddy.

 610               Proceedings       of the Royal     Society
 dredged in six fathoms,        on   mud and shell gravel.         Body,    some
 what pentagonal, of       a  pale-flesh   colour,   here and there slightly
 grained   with red   ;  having regular markings,         roughly   granulated,
 and with the margins         modified so as to fit the bases of the           five
 rays.   The first joint of    each   of the latter is nearly   plano-concave,
 minutely grained       and frosted (in spirit).       Between this and the
body is a biconvex, ligamentous connection.                 The next joint is
 somewhat lozenge-shaped,         presenting a central projection,      and two
slightly curved articular surfaces to the first joint, and             a longer
process and two more extensive           articular surfaces (also curved)        on
the distal side, each       of the latter articulating with a division            of
the bifid arm beyond.          Viewed dorsally, it has thus no less than
four articular ligaments.        The limbs usually separated at the joint
between this and the first segment.              A transverse section of an
arm at its base showed aborally an arched outline,                orally   a flat
tened, so that it was somewhat D-shaped,               with   a perforation       in
 the centre.   Two symmetrical         muscular    bundles were placed        over
each of the larger    joints inferiorly.     The first joint of the  secondary
arm is of an irregular rhomboidal           shape, being widest     towards its
outer edge, and with the deepest curve on its proximal side;                    the
second, of an irregular lozenge-shape,           pointed on both proximal
and distal edges,    especially the latter, the distal apex being on            the
outer side of the middle        line, the short outer curve thus formed
giving rise to the long, jointed limb.             The last joint presents a
somewhat plano-concave outline on its dorsal surface, the concavity
being proximal,     and articulating by means of         a biconvex ligament
with the preceding        segment.      From the outer side and           shorter
curve of the second last segment            springs, as before mentioned,          a
long, delicate,   jointed arm of ten gradually diminishing pieces,
like the skeleton of a vertebrate tail. The segments of these are
(in spirit) finely grained, and frosted (after the manner of              several
Lepraliae), like the larger segments, and have also microscopic            spikes
near the junctions, directed distally.         Along the ventral surface of
these slender armlets, after preservation          in spirit (which blanched
the rest), were numerous dull, reddish, minute tubercles, apparently
imbedded in the tough membrane that was present on this                 surface.
All  the arms and their branches were coloured, during life, of          a beau
tiful purple lake,  a  slightly paler portion being in the centre      dorsally.

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1865-66.                          611
    The Lard parts of the animal were densely calcareous, and the
disc seemed      quite solid.      On the under surface was a bulky, soft
mass,   of a  reddish-brown hue, which covered the central disc, and
extended outwards over the bases of the arms.                    Microscopically
this consisted     of  a rich cellulo-granular structure, that might have
been   the debris of ova.             The mass readily separated from the
under   surface of the body and arms, but left               a membranous    coat
ing which adhered very closely to the edges of the limbs, so that it
seemed a     fixed process.       In this   tough, translucent membrane were
many     minute calcareous         scales,   with  a concentric   structure,  like
those   of a  cycloid fish.      The oral surface, after removal of the soft
mass, had       a wide circular opening,           with several tooth-like pro
cesses   projecting inwards from the circumference.
    Imbedded in the soft        mass last mentioned,        and partly projecting
outwards, was      a  curious crustacean parasite, of a
mottled crimson colour, when fresh (fig. 5).
    The occurrence of Synapia Galliennii (Hera
 path),*   a species     hitherto only procured from
 Guernsey,      is interesting,     and shows how cau
 tiously   deductions      as    to    the  distribution     of
 marine animals ought to be made.                Some of the
 specimens, though imperfect, measured between
 2  and 3 inches, of     a  pale pinkish or flesh colour,
 clouded    by the dark         intestine.      Interspersed
 amongst      the   spicula   were numerous          circular,
 papilliform, grained rings of a brownish-red
 colour.    The specimens agreed in most respects
 with Dr Herapath's description,            but the anchors
 and anchor plates       seem     to be more than        " ser

 rated," since both       are studded
  of microscopic    spikes and granules, which impart to them a rough,
  corroded   aspect, very characteristic        when compared with the suc
  ceeding species or S. digitata.

 the plates and anchors visible as distinct glistening points under                 a

    GEParREA.—Priapulus         caudatus was met with           in great abun
dance    in the sandy mud of         a creek at low water ; some of the
specimens," independently       of the long tail, measuring 6 inches in
length.     A great change will require to be made in the descrip
tions of Professor E. Forbes, for he does not notice the presence of
the horny teeth of the proboscis, with their curved central and
three   lateral fangs, or the occurrence of papillae in rows on the
same   organ, or on the body and processes of the tail.
    Besides the common Sipunculus            Bernhardus     and S. Johnstoni,   a
new    Syrinx (Forbes),      Dendrostomum          (Quatrefages),    was found.
Dendrostomum Huxleyii,*           new sp.  ;  from under a stone lying on
muddy sand.        It  stretched    itself when living        to the length of
7  inches, both extremities      being tapered.       Body of a uniform      dull
brownish     hue,   elongated,     vermiform,       and   with the     proboscis
abruptly separated anteriorly by a well-marked               shoulder  ; instead
of having a smooth body, as in S. Harveii                (Forbes), to which    it
seems     most   nearly   allied,   this is everywhere marked by fine
transverse lines, closely studded with small papillae, just visible
to the naked eye.       The shoulder and base of the proboscis present
the   most   conspicuous     carunculae, those at the tapering,          downy,
posterior extremity being somewhat less marked, from the absence
of rugae.    The proboscis is about an inch and a quarter in length,
very rugose     at the base, more finely papillated          towards the extre
mity, near which the papillae sharp like spikes, and towards the
buccal cirri marked as minute black dots.

  2.  On the Natural History of Lewis.                By Professor Duns,
                                 D.D.,  F.RS.E.
    Comparatively little attention       has been given to the natural  his
tory of Lewis. Stray notices of the geology, botany, and zoology
of the Outer Hebrides are to be met with, but, with one or two
exceptions, these are not of much value. Martin's " Description
of the Western Islands (1703)," is chiefly interesting for its full
account of the industrial and moral condition of the people. Little,
however, can be made of his incidental references to the natural
history of the islands.        Two volumes on the " Economical History
of the Hebrides," by Rev. Dr Walker, Professor of Natural History
in the University of Edinburgh, were published in 1808, after Dr
Walker's death.         This work contains      a good deal of information
on    indigenous     plants,   but almost none on zoology.        Dr Macul-
loch's " Description        of the Western Islands of Scotland (3 vols.,
1819)," is     in  every way an abler and better work than either of the
two now named. Its notices of the geology and mineralogy of the
Outer Hebrides       are even still valuable.     The only other work call
 ing   for  notice  here is  the  late Mr James Wilson's " Voyage Kound
the Coast of Scotland and the Isles (2 vols. 1842)."              Mr Wilson
spent a short time at Stornoway, but the work contains only one
 brief reference to the zoology of the district. He names starlings,
 redbreasts, larks, thrushes, and sand-martens as the only land birds
 seen   by him near that town.
     In  addition to these works there are several separate papers on
 the natural history of the Long Island, which should             be named.
 Two were published           by the late   Professor  Macgillivray, in the
 second volume of the "Edinburgh Journal of Natural and Geo
 graphical Science (1819)," and another by Mr John Macgillivray,
           "                                       " Annals of Natural His
 on the      Zoology of the Hebrides," in tho
 tory (vol. viii. 1840)."        These papers are chiefly devoted to the
 zoology of Harris, and        are very imperfect.    In the " Transactions
 of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh (1841)," Dr Balfour pub
 lished a very complete list of the planfs of the " Outer Hebrides
  and Skye."                Thomas's interesting paper on
                                                              " The

 its zoology and surface geology.            In the present paper, attention
  is limited to the mammals, birds, reptiles, and land mollusca.

     These lists are not a little suggestive, when regarded from                               the
point of view of the geographical distribution of animals. Taking
into account the climatal condition of Lewis, its relation to the
mainland and to the islands of the Outer Hebrides group, it will be
seen that its fauna contains forms which could                         scarcely have          been
looked for there, and that others are absent which we might                                   have
expected          to find.      Its climate is comparatively                  mild,     and     not
so humid           as many      believe.          The mean annual             temperature is
46°'5', and the average annual                      rain-fall is not more than                 30'2
inches.           The greatest     cold is seldom              more than        35°,    and     the
greatest heat 65°.
     In     the list of mammalia             the Mustelidce are represented               by two
genera,       Lutra and Martes.              It   is,   however, remarkable that neither
the common weasel, the stoat, nor the polecat,                        s    htm Id be met with
in   a     locality which still shelters one of the least common                         Scottish
forms of this family — the rapidly decreasing                        Martes foina. This
animal, whose skin still sells at                 a     price varying from 14s. to 20s.,
occurs in Sir James Matheson's                           deer forest, Mhorsgail.           Under
the family Phocidce,           the common seal and the grey seal are named
as     known                                         When Martin

visited the district more than 160 years ago, he wrote — " Seals are
eaten by the vulgar, who find them to be as nourishing as beef                                  and
mutton." Two species of JUuridce occur — the common                                 mouse      and
the Norway rat. In almost all other districts these                                 species     are
found        associated with the shrews, the voles, and the field mouse,
none of which are met with in Lewis.                             It   is   curious,    too, that
while the common and Alpine hares abound, there                               are     no rabbits.
Several attempts to introduce them have failed.                              The fox,     hedge
hog, mole, and badger, are also absent, yet these,                            I     believe, all
occur in Skye.            The number of species of Mammalia which fall                           to

mollusca seven.           A    careful examination            may add some forms           to the
last   ;    but
              I     do not anticipate         that the list of birds will have             many
names added.
     Many of the birds came under my own observation.                                 Others    are
named from          a   collection preserved at the gamekeeper's lodge,                        near

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1865-66.                            621
Stornoway         Castle.     Several of the rarest forms are among these.
For the names of others                 I  am indebted        to   Mr Liddle, farmer,
Gress, an intelligent and trustworthy observer.
     Not fewer than ten species of Falconidce occur in Lewis, or in
some of the islands on the east and west coast.                      The golden eagle
is seen throughout the year ; in winter singly, in summer often in
pairs.       The belief is common among the people that this species
takes salmon, as well as hares, moorfowl,                      &c.    The white-tailed
eagle,     in its turn, poaches on the territory of the golden one.                    It
has been        often known to take lambs           as well     as salmon, and is said
to have       killed   a fawn   in Mhorsgail Deer Forest.            The fishing osprey
 is more        common      than either of these.          It    nests in the Shiant
Islands, and may not unfrequently                be seen on the        Uig coast.    The
jer-falcon is only an occasional visitor. It is more frequently seen
 in the Flannen Isles, on the west coast of Lewis. The peregrine
 falcon      is observed throughout the year. It is noted as a bold
 hunter, and very destructive to young grouse.                       When pressed by
 hunger       it will attack the old also.         Its favourite prey is tho rock
 pigeons, which abound on the west coast especially.                        The merlin
 was once abundant, but is now comparatively                      rare.  The sparrow-
  hawk is common.              The kestrel is not      so.      Two snowy owls were
  shot at the Butt in 1855, and one at Uig in 1859. The common
  and barn owls are comparatively              rare.    A  good observer described
  to the    author    a species   which he had once      seen, as small, bare on the
  toes,  brown      above and     yellowish below.       The description suggested
  Noctua nudipes of Gould             ;  but this is of very rare occurrence in
  Britain, and even on the Continent it is seldom met with north of
  lat. 55°.
      The cuckoo frequently appears in the end of April, but its usual
  time seems to be from the 10th to the 15th of May. Writing of
   Rona,      Martin makes the following note               : — " The    inhabitants    of
   this  little   island say that the cuckow is never seen or heard here,
   but after the death of the           Earl of Seaforth or the minister !"
       Among the         Corvidce,  the raven and grey-backed             crow are com
   mon.        Both of these birds          are  very bold,         and  destructive    to
    grouse.      The former not unfrequently attacks diseased sheep, and
    picks their eyes out before the animals are dead.                    Several of the
    latter have been seen to attack the female grouse, when covering

  622                Proceedings      of the Royal Society
  her young,     drive her away, and fly off with a young            bird each.
  Both build in the wild cliffs overhanging        the sea, but they are often
  met with in the moors.          The rook is rarely seen in Lewis. It is
  noticed only as    an occasional visitor in winter, and, when disturbed,
  takes   flight in the direction of the mainland;               yet   there     is
  abundance of food for it.         Not only   does  the earthworm      abound,
  but many hurtful grubs also.         Cultivated   patches were pointed out
  to me as having been destroyed by mildow, but on pulling up the
  plants by the roots, numerous wire worms of Tipula                and Elator
  were seen.
     The jackdaw is absent, but the starling, which in many of its
  habits resembles this bird, is very abundant.           The starling builds
 in the holes of rocks, and       seems to be much more      particular     about
 its nest than it is in the south.          In Lewis it   uses moss and wool
 as a  lining, and is often      seen on the sheep's back, not feeding on
 the ticks, which     it sometimes    does, but  quietly pulling out the     wool
 for nest-lining.
    Six species of the family Turdidm occur. Of these the dipper
 is the least common.        The ring ousel is met with in summer. An
 interesting    illustration of what might be called the adaptive power
 of instinct came under my notice in the little island named Pabba,
 near the    Uig shore.      On the 15th of    June 1865, when examining
the rocks of the island,       I  met with a nest of the common thrush,
containing four eggs. In placing it at the top of a sand-covered
rock, over the edge of which long stalks of lyme grass drooped, the
bird had availed itself of these for a kind of cradle for the nest.
Indeed, some of the leaves were woven into the outer covering of
the nest, which was thus hung out over the bank.                In the Low
lands the favourite nesting-place        of the thrush is   a tree or a bush;
but as these are of rare occurrence indeed in Lewis, the bird yields
to circumstances, and places its nest in the hollows of the rocks, or
on the top of sand-banks            near the shore.     In this   case   it  had
managed to place it where it would              swing in the breeze. The
nesting-time      of the  thrush   in the  south is in April and the begin
ning of May. These birds occur in great numbers all over Lewis.
The missel-thrush and redwing appear in winter.              In the south     the
former is most common, in the north the latter.
    The family Sylviidce is well represented.          Some members occur

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1865-66.                      623
in Lewis, which      we could    not have expected to find.     I  met with
the garden-warbler, the willow wood-wren, and the pretty little
gold-crest, in the plantation around Stornoway Castle. The age of
the trees and bushes there is not great. These birds must thus
have found their way thither after the plantation was made. It
would be interesting enough if we could trace the path of their pro
gress    north, especially as they arrive only a few days later than
 those which frequent the neighbourhood of Edinburgh.              The pre
sence     of the blue tit is     as curious.   Of related forms the pied
 wagtail and yellowhammer,         whinchat and redbreast, may      be men
 tioned as not common.
    The lark may      be named the     bird of Lewis.    On every moor, in
 every cultivated spot, inland or along the shore, wherever there is
 a bit of turf, you meet this bird.        Some have thought that the in
 crease of starlings in the Lowlands has thinned the number of larks.
 In   Lewis both   are very abundant.
    Among the Fringillidce, perhaps the least common is the house-
 sparrow. " A pair of sparrows," says James Wilson, in the work
 referred to   above,
                        " built in Stornoway in 1833, but    we did not see
 their descendants in 1841."         I believe  that the date of the intro
 duction of the sparrow into Lewis is correct. They are now spread
 all over the country ; but in few localities, except in Stornoway, do
 they breed in the      eaves and thatch    of houses.   Even the sparrow
 turns away from the wretched huts in which the majority of the
 people dwell.      Here, again, we have an illustration of the influence
 of habit on instinct. Were a sparrow to build a nest in the thatch
 of one of these wretched hovels, it would be almost sure to be
 destroyed when the eggs were dropped.             To prevent the escape of
  smoke almost all the huts are       built without a chimney.     Windows
  occur in very few of them, and the doors are smaller than those of
  cottages in the Lowlands. The object of this is to direct the peat
  smoke    into the loose thatch,      in which   the soot may lodge.     In
  spring this part of the covering is taken off, and spread over the
  " lazy beds," in which barley and green crops are to be raised.
  Thus manured, they yield abundant crops.            The sparrow has been
  taught the uncertainty of tenure in such roofs, and builds its nest
  in the holes of rocks instead of the habitations of man.

pigeon.    The former is very abundant; the latter is only seen
occasionally in spring or in autumn.   Some years ago one of Sir
James Matheson's keepers shot a specimen of the turtle dove. This,
 I   believe, is the only instance in which this bird has been met with
so far north.
       When the pheasant           was first introduced,        it roosted habitually           on
the trees near Stornoway Castle.                       This it seldom does          now.      Has
 it,   too, learned something by experience?                    It    has nothing to       dread
from fox, or polecat, or ermine                 ;   and the marten, which would                 be
destructive       to   it,   frequents     a    distant locality.         Efforts   have been
made to introduce the black grouse, but they have not as yet                                been
successful.          Walker    seems to have met            with    it   on the occasion         of
his visit to these islands.                He says, " The stomach of the                   black
cock    is   often found stuffed in spring with the Polypodium vulgar*                          ;"
and adds, " This         is   the only certain instance              that has occurred           of
any animal living upon              a   plant of the fern kind in this country."
Ptarmigan         are very common, especially               on the Lewis slopes of             the
Harris hills.          The red grouse             is   not fit for shooting         till   about
September.
      One species of Gruidce, the grey crane, has several times been                        shot
in severe winter weather.                 Of the Pluvialidoe,        the golden plover          is
very abundant in the moors during summer.                        In winter      it   retires    to
the shore. The dotterel            is   seen   in June and    July, and the      ring-plover
is   very abundant throughout                  the year.    Mr Macgillivray          says that
the lapwing       is   of extremely rare occurrence in the Hebrides.                        This
is
a       mistake   I
                  ;     saw   it   frequently.         Its habits   as to change of place
are similar to those of the golden plover.                          The turnstone      is     met
with during winter.     The oyster-catcher                     is    abundant.      I      found
several nests on        a     shelving rock near Gallan Head, with                    eggs      in
them, on the 14th of               June. In         some the shell was beginning                to
break, and the "peep-peep" of the chick could be heard.                                In      the
Fern Islands the young of this bird appear      fortnight earlier.   a
The nesting-place was hollow in the large rock, without lining
                                   a                                                            of
any kind.
     Of the Tringidce, the grey sandpiper arrives in small                           flocks     in

abundant,     and the whimbrel is seen         in May for  a short    time.    It
does not seem to breed         in Lewis.
   The TotanidcB are represented by the redshank, which is not
common, and is seen only in summer. Three species of Scolopacidw
are met      with.    The common snipe is abundant throughout the
year.    The jack-snipe is not common in winter. The woodcock
arrives, but not in great numbers, in October.              In  no case have
they been known to remain during summer.
   The common heron is often observed in winter; very seldom at
any other season. The water-rail is not common.                    It is found
throughout the year.           The land-rail arrives between the middle
and end of May ; but          a curious   fact was brought under my notice
in regard to it     :  its cry is frequently heard in Bernera, Uig, ten
days or a     week earlier than in the Long Island itself.
    No fewer than nineteen species of Anatidce have been met with
in Lewis.       Among these, the grey lag and bean goose 'are seen
occasionally in winter ; the pink-footed or short- billed goose breeds
in the     Flannen       Islands;    the   white-fronted   goose,    the   swan,
shieldrake, velvet and black scoters, appear in winter; the pintail
teal is rare. The wigeon has frequently been shot in Lewis, though
 Mr Macgillivray        says,
                                " In the north of Scotland they          are un
common      ;  on its north-west      coast scarcely ever seen ;  in the Outer
Hebrides,     I believe,    never."    The broad-billed scaup duck is      a rare
winter visitant.        The eider duck breeds in the Flannen Isles.             1
saw a pair which had been brought to Bernera two days before my
visit.   I observed     a  pair of the golden eye on a small lake in Uig in
June. I       watched them with a field-glass for about an hour. One of
Sir James       Matheson's      keepers was with me, but they never came
within gun-shot.        The gooseander breeds occasionally in the district.
    All the other forms named in the list of birds are abundant, with
 the exception     of the little grebe, which is not very common.
    Under Reptilia      I  have set down the common adder; but its oc
 currence in Lewis is apocryphal, though assured by several that they
 had seen what must have been an adder. The only reptile is the slow
 worm,    of which the people have          a great and superstitious      dread,
 though it is perfectly harmless.          The frog, the toad, and the newt
 are absent.     On this account, the people call Lewis a blessed country,
 in being so free from the evil creatures that abound in the south !

3. On    M. Liege HourieV Process of Preparing Wheat Flour.
                           By Professor Wilson.
    Some twelve     years    ago M.     Mege    Mouries had his      attention
directed   to the    composition      of the grain of -wheat, and       to the
processes   of grinding and panification.         The object of that    gentle
man's    investigations     was   to show the      defective  knowledge      and
waste of material       in   the ordinary practices       of the trade    ;   but
although these were      fully proved by the results, there       appeared to
have been trade and other difficulties in the way of its general
                                                         " Food Substances"
adoption.     Having last year acted as juror on
at the Dublin Exhibition,        I  had my attention recalled to the sub
ject by an article which was submitted to the jury under the name
of " Cerealina," purporting to be a preparation of wheat flour by
the process indicated by M. Mege Mouries,            and which, on examina
tion, confirmed the opinions which had been previously formed                  of
its food value.      On further inquiry, it was found           that  a simple
mechanical     process had been devised in the United States,            where
the flour had been prepared, for effecting the most difficult part             of
M. Mege Mouries' process — that of decorticating the grain. This
rendered the operation of preparation so easy and so inexpensive
as to make    it desirable that attention should again be called to the
process.    In examining the composition of the grain of wheat, M.
 Mege Mouries found         that it was   a far more complicated     structure
 than was commonly supposed — that it consisted of (1)               an     outer
 covering   or epidermis,     (2) epicarp, (3) endocarp, and that these
 three layers consisted      chiefly of ligneous tissue, and formed the
exterior covering of the grain or true bran, and had no food              value.
 Together, they averaged from two to three per cent, of the              weight
of the wheat.        Beneath      these came (4) the testa or seed-coat
proper, which was a distinct cellular tissue of a dark colour— yellow
or orange, according to the description           of the grain  ; and (5),    the
embryo membrane, directly connected with the germ, which, indeed,
it supplied   as soon as the    vital principles of growth were        excited.
 These two coats or layers        contained    nitrogenous    matters in large
 proportions, and enveloped        the mass of starch-cells     which   formed
 the body of the grain.         Ordinary flour was composed entirely            of

                   of Edinburgh, Session 1865-66.                         627
these interior starch-cells    — the remaining portions of the grain
being separated in the shape of bran, and carrying away with them,
at the same time, a proportion,       generally five or six per cent., of
the flour also.    M. Mege Mouries found that the gluten contained
in the grain     was  very unequally divided     ;  that while in the epi
dermis or the true bran it was least, it existed in larger quantity in
the two next layers than it did in the starch-cells or flour of the
interior.     He therefore    recommended      that   the grain    should  be
merely decorticated      previous to grinding, and that the layers of
cells,  so rich in gluten as the testa and embryo membrane, should
be ground up with the starch cells, and form part of the flour used
for bread or other food purposes.          From an analysis which has
been made by Dr Lyon Playfair, I found that by this process the
true bran contains only 4 571 per cent, of gluten instead of 15-019
by the ordinary process. The flour made by M. Mege Mouries'
process contains 15-672 per cent, of gluten, as compared with 9-795
in the ordinary flour.      By merely taking off the outer covering of
the grain, which is perfectly valueless as an article of food, instead
of following the ordinary process, which takes off at least 14 per
cent, of bran, fully 10 per cent, is added to the food portion of
wheat,     while the nutritive value of flour is increased by about 60
per cent. This, upon the wheat consumption of the kingdom, — say
20,000,000 of quarters, — is a matter of considerable importance.
Another      important advantage      is secured by      M. Mege Mouries'
process in regard to the storage and preservation of wheat.             It ap
pears that the outer covering — the epidermis — absorbs moisture far
 more readily than the regular cellular tissue of the inner layers,
 and thus renders the grain more or less liable to mould and other
 injuries by keeping,      unless  great care be taken by occasionally
 shifting, &c.    By the process of decortication        this is entirely re
 moved, and a hard, smooth surface given to the grain, from which
 every particle of deteriorating     matter, in the shape of dirt, smut,
 &c., has   been  removed, diminishing its bulk,       and leaving it ready
 for the miller whenever it may        be required.     The following is the
 method     adopted  for the preparation      of the grain      by M. Mege
 Mouries' process : —
    "Wheat is carried up     to the topmost floor, then, passing through
 a screen or riddle,    it falls through    a  hopper into    a  long narrow

628                 Proceedings     of the Royal     Society
trough    which    contains   water, and is traversed through its length
by an Archimedian screw.            This carries the wheat slowly along
the trough to the discharge end, where it now, in a moistened
state, falls down a tube to the unbranning or decorticating               cylin
ders.    These are formed of cylinders of cast-iron, ridged on their
interior diameters, and with closed ends.            A  screw shaft traverses
the centre of them, carrying broad arms or floats set at an angle,
diagonal, or    'aslant' to the face of the cylinder, and with             a dia
meter so much less than that as to cause friction, but to allow the
grain to pass without crushing.           A  rapid rotation    is given to this
central   shaft, and, owing to the angle at which the floats are              set,
a  slight progressive motion is given to the grain.               The   friction
causes a large proportion       of the true   bran — epidermis,    epicarp,   &c.
— to   be separated;     and this is removed, as it is separated,           by a
blast driven     through    the cylinder in a direction        contrary to    the
motion of the shaft, which also has the effect of drying the              excess
of moisture of the grain.          It then passes along a spout into a
second cylinder, where it undergoes the same process ; and, finally,
is carried into the drying-chambers,           composed of a series of iron
troughs,    along which      the grain    is propelled    by screw shafts,       a
current   of dry warm air being driven along them in an opposite
direction.     It then, quite dry, receives its last friction in the
polishing cylinders,      where the friction is limited to that of the
grains   themselves, and leaves it in a dry, smooth, rounded form.
As this generates       a considerable     elevation   of temperature, it      re
quires to undergo a cooling process before storing or using.                This
is effected by carrying it up to the upper floor, and allowing it               to
fall down inclined planes through          a flat shoot, up   which   a blast of
cold air is driven.1'
4. Observations        on Meat (Butchers'-meat),              in relation       to
    the Changes to which          it is liable under different circum
    stances.       By John Davy, M.D., F.B.SS., Loudon and
    Edinburgh, &c.
   Animal food is of       so much importance,       in relation to our wants
 ns to diet, that   I have been induced to make some experiments               on

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1865-66.                                  629
it,   with the hope of obtaining useful results.                    TheseI       now submit
to the Society,           imperfect      as they are,    trusting that they may not
prove altogether useless, and that they may lead to further inquiry.
                 1.   Of Degree    of   Temperature as modifying       Change.
      It
      well known bow rapidly meat undergoes the putrefactive
           is
change in the height of summer, and in tropical climates at all
seasons;          and, on the contrary, how long             it   may be kept free from
putridity during our winter, and more especially at the freezing
temperature, and degrees of temperature approaching the freezing,                           —
in this,        as    in the preceding       instance,   fully exposed to the air of
ordinary atmospheric humidity.
   In the comparative trials have made inI                    each season,       for the sake
of precision, the meat used has                  been divided      into two portions, —
one, suspended by            a    thread, has been    fully exposed to the air of the
room       ;    the other has been suspended in               a   receiver   over    a   little
water, — the receiver,             so covered     as to admit air, and           yet prevent
rapid desiccation by evaporation.
      In   one experiment          on portions     of lamb, made at          a   temperature
varying from            60° to 65°      of Fahr., between the 11th and 12th of
August, the results were strikingly different.                        The portion fully
exposed to the air lost weight rapidly, and soon became dry and
hard, without acquiring any putrid taint                      ;   whilst the other, on
the contrary, softened, and for most part actually liquified, at the
same time becoming                 extremely     putrid.*   I     have mentioned         these
results in        a    note, in   a   paper published       in the last volume of the
Society's Transactions,f and in the same note have adverted to the
fact of the perfect preservation of the meat during the like time
and temperature over water in vacuo.
      In   a    second trial made in winter,        a    portion weighing 141'1 grs.,
exposed freely            to the air, became dry and hard in twenty-three
days, viz., from the 27th of October to the 19th of November, the
thermometer in the room averaging about 55°.     During this time
  • The droppings from tho putrifying meat have had some resemblance to
chyme, being found to consist of   fluid congulable by heat, in which wero
                                             a

neath had a taint of the same.                           On the 15th of December it was
reduced to 26'6 grs., or had lost 65 2 per cent.                                The delicate       white
fibres were somewhat                shrunken        ;    the upper moiety               had become
darker; cut into, the mouldiness was found to be superficial; the
interior, of a darkened colour, was of increased translucency ; its
muscular fasiculi were distinct               ;   their structure          so   little altered,     that
when moistened with dilute acetic acid their striae were seen well
defined.        Underneath,         in the water, there              was    a    little white       sedi
ment, which was found to consist chiefly of cells (spores) thrown
off from the mildewed surface.                    Evaporated to dryness, the residue
weighed     only       -4 gr.       Replaced            over fresh water, this water,                 in
three days, had become slightly turbid from spores suspended in                                        it,
and had acquired the peculiar smell of mould                         .f    The portion of           meat
was now freely exposed to the                 air ;     it   soon   shrunk and became              hard;
and wheu        it    sustained     no further loss from evaporation                      it   was re
duced to 21 grs.,        a    loss of 71-6 per cent. —              a   part of which loss,           it
may be presumed, was owing to the vegetable growth.
    In   the paper already referred                 to,  I     have mentioned             that dried
meat does not attract the flesh-fly,                         only the putrid in progress               of
deliquescence, when            it   affords   a     fit nidus for the            larvas   of this    fly,
and for their nutriment.             I   may further remark that the tempera
ture at which the flesh-fly loses its activity, and                              is   no longer     seen
 •   This may help to account for what      stated of body long buried, which,

  putrefaction ceases and the mould-growth takes its place.
  2.  Of  a Moist or Vaporous state      of Atmosphere      as modifying       Change.
     The influence of warmth and moisture of atmosphere in pro
  moting the putrid- decomposition of animal matter is an established
  fact.   It is well known that within the tropics, especially in littoral
  regions where the thermometer ranges between                78° and S3" or 84°,
  and the atmosphere is commonly damp, the difference between the
  moistened    and dry bulb seldom exceeding 5° or 6°, putrefaction                  is
  so rapid that meat cannot be kept more than                a  few hours without
  acquiring    a putrid taint.    When, however, the air is very dry, as
  iu Nubia and the African deserts, then the putrefactive process is
   very much arrested, though the temperature may be high. At
  Malta a wind occasionally prevails, — a south-west wind, coming from
  Africa, — which, in the summer          season,   I  have known         as   high  as
   105°, and so dry that the difference between the moistened and dry-
  bulb thermometer      has been     as much as 30°.          The atmosphere of
  Nubia is somewhat of the      same character ; and its          quality,   as to the
  checking of the putrefactive change, is well shown by a passage in
  a very charming book by a lady, — Lady Duff Gordon's
                                                                            " Letters
  from Egypt," 1863-65 ; writing from that country, Nubia, she re-
  marks : " Fancy that meat kept ten and fourteen days under a sun
,
  which   I was forced   to cover my head before          !    In Cairo you must
  cook your meat in two days       ;   in Alexandria as soon as killed, and
  the sun is nothing there.       But in Nubia        I  walked     till I wore    out
  my shoes and roasted my feet        :  and   I was  as dry as    a chip in Nubia
  and as low down as Kiné, below Thebes some way                 ; after, it altered,
  and, though cold,   I perspired again."        I may mention another strik
  ing example. In the early      spring of 1826 I visited the Greek island
  of Ipsara, a little more than two years after it had               been     invaded
  and devastated by   a merciless Turkish force.*           We found it      a desert,
  the town in ruins, only one of the inhabitants remaining,              who served
  as our guide, all the rest, excepting those who escaped in their ships,
  or were captured     and enslaved, having been massacred.                    On one
  side of the island, exposed to the south-east wind, the moist sirocco,
                  * Thi9 was in Juno     1824. about midsummer.

  on a spot where the carnage had been greatest, only bleached                      bones
  were to be seen      ;  whilst on the other and opposite side, exposed to
  the north, to the dry Etesian wind, at a battery called Fetellio,
  which had been heroically defended, we found two or three hundred
  bodies    still remaining, lying      as they     fell, and    so little   were they
  changed      that our companion         was able, though their faces                were
  blackened and shrunk, to recognise each individual by his                    features.
  They had       become, as    it were, natural mummies        ;  their clothes — for
  they were all clad — had apparently suffered little decay                ;  and their
  hair,   except    that   it   was   a little  bleached,     showed       its    natural
 colour.
      Whether such       a  checking of putrefaction         is owing to         a   rapid
 desiccation      of the surface and       a retardation     of the entrance           and
 penetration       of oxygen,     or to other less obvious causes, may                be a
 question.       I  am disposed to consider       it owing to the former,            inas
 much as putrefaction          always begins at the surface,*          and from        the
 circumstance that desiccating           substances, such as quicklime,               pre
 vent putrefaction.      f
                      3.  Of Cooking    as modifying     Change.
      That the boiling or roasting of meat thoroughly enables it                    to be
 kept longer, even at a temperature and moist state of atmosphere
     • It is well known to cooks, that whilst tho outer surface of meat,          sueh as
 venison, may bo offensively tainted, the inner portion may be comparatively
 sweet and fit for uso, especially if the deer, as soon as shot, has, according to
 tho practice of the skilled forester, been well blooded. It need hardly be re-
 markod, that if the blood is allowed to remain, it is itself a source of putre
faction,    owing to tho oxygen which it retains.          The butcher, guided by
 experience, is most careful in expelling as much blood as possible without
delay from his slaughtered animals.
    t  I may refer, in proof of the above, to tho results of experiments given
in vol. ii. of my Researches, published        in  1838,  confirmed by others in           a
later vol., that of 1863.     In the former I have quoted an instance from the
" Philosophical Transactions, Abridged," vol. ix., of the futility of burying
the carcasses of diseased cattle with quicklime.       Tet quicklime    is still ordered
to be used in the interment of such carcasses,        but with tho addition of       some
disinfectant.     Such a procedure, no doubt, will vastly delay tho decomposition
of the bodies, and prevent the formation of offensive gases.             Carbolic acid,
one of the disinfectants recommended, has the advantage, I find, of being               re
pulsive to dogs.     A portion of meat moistened with this acid was refused             by
three hungry dogs.

                           of Edinburgh,      Session       1865-66.                      633
most    favourable         to putrefaction,    is well known         to the housewife.
From the few trials           I   have made, the process appears to arrest the
putrefactive change, and to favour other changes with the produc
tion of mould or mildew.
   The following is an instance : — On the 11th of July 1864, a por
tion of well-boiled mutton was suspended in a receiver, and covered
with a plate of glass not air-tight. It weighed 82'2 grs. On the
20th of the same month it was reduced in weight to 74-3 grs., and
on the 7th of August to 65- 6 grs.                It    now had a slight smell, not
agTeeable, not putrid.            It seemed   drier, and was covered with mould
of various colours, mostly white.                Cut into, its interior had the
smell of decaying cheese.    The muscular fasciculi were distinct;
and, with the aid of dilute acetic acid, their striated structure was
seen.      It   was near, and only near, the surface, that the vegetable
growth was visible.   Four months later, it weighed 49'4 grs. It
was drier, and had become very much darker ; its colour was a very
dark brown.     Examined in the following December, i.e., after
seventeen months, some mildew was found on its surface.                              It   had
an ammon iacal and disagreeable smell, like that of rotten cheese,
und'it cut like such                 When broken, not cut, it was found
                               cheese.
friable.        The muscular fasciculi still retained their form, and, with
dilute acetic acid, showed the striated marking, with an increase of
transluceucy.    From another experiment of the same kind on
boiled mutton, begun on the 13th of August 1864, and continued
to the 11th December of the present year, like results were ob
tained
  Blood, too,          I   find, after having been          subjected    to the      boiling
temperature,                           arrested, like muscle, and
                      has its tendency to putrefy,
that from keeping it undergoes somewhat similar changes.      may                    I
mention one instance: — On the 6th of September 1864, a portion
of fowl's blood, just after it had coagulated,                 was    boiled for several
hours.   The vial holding            it,
                               on its cooling,                was    corked, but not so
tightly    as to prevent the admission           of air.      It   was placed   in   a   room
where there was no fire in winter, and, with the exception of being
under cover, the temperature to which                  it   was exposed differed          but
little from that of the open air. Examined on the 14th of December
1865,    it     was   found    moderately dry, for most part of            a    brick-red
colour, partially whitish.            It   had an ammoniacal odour, no putrid

634                    Proceedings            of   the   Royal Society
odour.   Under the microscope, it was seen to consist chiefly of
amorphous matter, of cells like the spores of mucedo, and of Wood
corpuscles, — these, except in form and size, but little altered; — no
crystals were visible.              It   imparted        to water only a very faint, just
perceptible, brownish hue, as seen after filtration and separation                                      of
suspended particles.                The water had            a strong         alkaline       reaction,
but was almost tasteless.
      A   clot of blood — to mention               another     instance   — which            had been
boiled only ten minutes,                 kept the same           time, offered nearly                  the
same results.          It escaped     the putrefactive change             ;    mould formed            on
it,   which, after more than             a   year, was of various colours, bright                     red,
white, and black — changes of colour,                     it   may be conjectured, owing
to the different states            of the vegetation.
      Is the change which meat and blood undergo after exposure                                         to
uboiling temperature, as described, in any way analogous                                         to that
which vegetables experience when converted into peat? —                                      a   conver

aware of any peat-formation     having ever yet been discovered                                         in

      From time to time       I     have made some other experiments on                           meats
chiefly with   view to their preservation.
                   a                       The first instituted were
with sulphurous acid, of which have given an account in volume
                                             I                                               a

                            published                                                         vinegar,
the results of which are there also described.*                       The sulphurous                  acid
had previously         been       employed in arresting the fermentation                         of   the
more delicate white wines.                I     found     it   to arrest the putrefaction
equally well of animal and vegetable substances, and so preserving
them as to render them not unfit for use as human food.                                           Trials
with vinegar and dilute acetic acid gave somewhat similar results,
so far as the immediate              arrest of putrefaction           was concerned               ;   but
it    did not, like the sulphurous                 acid, so alter the character                  of   the

     If  the subject under consideration,            that of the preservation of
 meat, is always, from an economical                point of view, deserving of
 attention, is it not especially so at a time such as the present, when,
 owing to the cattle plague, there is a danger of a stinted supply, at
 a  greatly enhanced price?
 5.   The Buried Forests and Peat Mosses of Scotland.                          By
     James Geikie, Esq.             Communicated          by Archibald Geikie,
     Esq.
     This communication is an attempt to eliminate the geological
 history of our Scottish peat mosses, which appear to contain the
 record of certain      changes of climate, that have not hitherto fully
engaged attention.          The phenomena revealed by our peat              mosses
are threefold — First, the buried            trees,   and the condition    of this
country at the period of their growth            ;  second, the causes which led
to,the destruction of these trees          ;  and, third, the present aspect of
the peat mosses.        Under the first head is to be considered the con
tinental period of Great Britain, to which the buried trees in the
older peat bogs of the country belong.               Under the second head, the
causes of the destruction of these trees are chiefly assigned to the
upward growth of wet mosses, the chilling effects of which caused
the overthrow of the trees.             This points     to a change   of climate  ;
    * Since the experiments       above  referred to were made, others have been
tried, the results, too, of which    I may briefly describe.
    On the 9th of September,     a fresh parr, laid open and eviscerated, was sus
pended by a thread in a bottle in which was a little vinegar, the parr not in
contact with the acid. Another parr, similarly prepared, was moistened with
vinegar and wrapped in blotting-paper, also moistened with the acid. Thus
enclosed, it was placed in an ale- glass and covered with a tumbler.         After
eight    days the suspended parr was found well preserved ; it had not the
slightest unpleasant smell ; its surface was not distinctly acid to the taste,
and its teeth retained their sharpness. The other parr was also free from any
unpleasant smell, but was softening in places ; the bones were quite soft.
After   ten days the body of the first parr was found detached from softeniug,
and had fallen into the acid, the head remaining suspended, and it was still
free from any unpleasant smell, as was also the softened body. The parr in
paper was little changed    ; it  showed  no marks of putridity.

  the country was no longer        characterised   by an excessive       or con
  tinental climate, but by an insular and more moist one. In regard
  to the third head —the present aspect of the peat mosses — a glance
 at these  will convince any geologist that the peat            moss formation
  has  not only ceased to spread, but is in most cases rapidly disap
 pearing.     The moisture, which in former times afforded it nourish
 ment and support, has now become its chief enemy. Every shower
 of rain, every frost, gives fresh impetus to the decay ; and leaving
 altogether out of account the operations of agriculture, there can
 be no doubt that natural causes alone will in time suffice to strip
 the last vestige of black peat from     hill and valley.     The peat    mosses
 of Scotland    are  only a  wreck of what they have once been.              The
 growth of the peat has ceased to be general         :  here and there mosses
 continue to increase in sufficient abundance to form that substance,
 but this increase is far exceeded by the general rate of decay.             The
 peaty covering     invariably shows     an upper or surface         stratum    of
 heath and grasses, and        is almost everywhere         full of holes    and
 winding channels.        These, and other appearances, convince              the
writer that the climate       has  now become     less   humid — agricultural
operations alone      not being    entirely sufficient     to account for the
change.     The change of climate indicated by the wasted aspect of
peat moss appears to have shown itself first along the southern
limits of that formation in Europe.           It then slowly extended its
influence in   a  northward direction, meeting in its course with many
modifications,    such as must arise from local circumstances.             Chief
among these was       the configuration of the land — the peat of low-
lying districts dying out more quickly than the              mosses   of higher
levels, where any diminution of moisture         is last to be appreciated.
In the   same manner, the track       of the rainy winds on the west and
south-west    coasts have also marked        out a region where we now
meet with less waste       among the mosses        than in other districts.
But   as the   effect of such    a cosmical   change must be so blended
with the results brought       about by the progress of cultivation, the
geologist can do little more than suggest the extreme probability
of its existence.     As it   can  be shown that the destruction          of our
ancient forests is not primarily due to man, although              in the later
stages  of the process    he  certainly played   an    important    part, so we
may expect that the change from           a  humid     to a drier  climate has

also been   effected by natural       causes ;  but man, eagerly following
nature, has outstripped her in her work, and so identified this with
his own, that it now becomes scarcely possible to distinguish the
one from the other.

       Sir DAVID BKEWSTER, President, in                       the Chair.
     Tbe President, in delivering the Neill Medal            to Professor A.    C
 Ramsay,     LL.D., F.R.S., &c., made the following remarks :—
    In adjudicating     the  Neill Prize for the triennial period           from
 1862 to 1865, the Council of the Royal Society could not overlook
 the high claims of our eminent countryman,              Mr Andrew     Ramsay,
 Professor of Geology in the Government            School of Mines, and local
 Director of the Geological Survey of Great Britain.
    Mr Ramsay's geological studies commenced with               a survey of the
Island of Arran.        After investigating the structure and the rela
tions of the rocks of that interesting island, he embodied the re
sults of his researches in       a  beautifully executed model, which we
had the pleasure of seeing at the meeting of the British Associa
tion at Glasgow in 1840.              This model, which was afterwards
published on the scale       of    two inches to the mile, attracted the
particular attention      of Sir Henry De La Beche, the               Director-
General of the Geological Survey; and in the following year Mr
Ramsay was appointed one of the surveyors who were then at work
in the county of Pembroke.
    In  1845, when the Survey was remodelled, the important                office
of local Director for Great Britain         was conferred upon     Mr  Ramsay,

                  of Edinburgh, Session 1865-66.                   639
and he has to the present day discharged its duties with credit to
himself and advantage to the Survey.            He has thus not only
mapped large areas with his own hand, but has had the general
superintendence     of the geological  researches carried on under Sir
Henry De La Beche, and afterwards under our distinguished coun
tryman, Sir Roderick Murchison.
   In  1847   Mr Ramsay was appointed to the Chair of Geology in
the University College, London, an office which he held till 1851,
when he was chosen Lecturer on Geology in the Royal School of
 Mines in Jermyn Street.
   In the midst of these various official duties, Mr Ramsay found
leisure for pursuing several interesting branches of geological re
search.     In 1846 he published,    in the Memoirs    of the Geological
Survey, a    paper on the
                           " Denudation   of South Wales," which led
the way to those measured details by which this branch of geology
has been so greatly advanced.
   In 1855 Mr Ramsay published his remarkable paper on the
" Permian Breccias of Shropshire," in which he made it highly
probable     that there were glaciers    in our latitudes    during the
Fermian era     ;  and  he at the same time       suggested, that some
of the thick conglomerates of the Scottish Old Red Sandstone
 might, in like manner, be the representatives of an ancient glacial
drift.
    Mr Ramsay has distinguished himself by the energy and ability
 with which he has elucidated     the history of the glacial period in
 the British islands, and by the ingenious theory in which he refers
 the frequent occurrence of rock-basin     lakes, in the northern hemi
 sphere, to glacier erosion during the glacial period.
    No British geologist, in our day, has done more than Mr Ramsay
to extend our knowledge of the causes to which the present outlines
 of the surface of our country is due.
    In his annual addresses, as President of the Geological Society,
in 1863 and 1864, he has skilfully applied his extensive and
 minute stratigraphical knowledge to those higher branches of phi
losophical geology which deal with the succession of life in time,
 and with the relation between the appearance of liviug beings on
 the surface of the earth and the physical     changes which that sur
 face has undergone.

   For these varied and important labours, the Council of the Royal
Society considered Mr Ramsay well entitled to the honour of re
ceiving the Neill Medal.        The President, addressing Mr Ramsay,
then said,
   Mr Ramsay,     I have much pleasure in delivering to you the Neill
Medal, and in congratulating you on          an honour which you hare so
well deserved.
   At the request of the Council, Professor Piazzi Smyth,                Astro
                                        " an account of recent
nomer-Royal for Scotland, gave                                    measures at
the Great Pyramid, and the deductions flowing therefrom."
   This address, which was illustrated by specimens,           models,    draw
ings,   and stereoscopic    photographs,      referred  chiefly to    the four
months' labour of the author in the winter and spring of             1864 ainl
1865 at the Great Pyramid       ;  where he went with the approval             of,
and also, he thankfully       acknowledges,      a considerable    amount       of
assistance from,    His Highness the Viceroy of Egypt.          The   observa
tions then made, comprised        measures of length,      angle,   and heat;
and are enough to fill several MS. books, which are being             prepared
for publication.      The author, indeed, had hoped to put all these
foundational   facts into the hands of the public before venturing to
announce any of the conclusions, but was overruled by respect
                                                                              for
the appeal made to him by the Council of the Society on this occa
sion.     He trusts however,      still, that no one will prejudge           the
pyramid     question on hearsay, but wait until they have all                tbe
instrumental    particulars  before them.

1.  Some Observations on Incubation.                 By John Davy, M.D.         ,
                         F.R.S., Lond. and Edin.
   In this   paper its author       describes the results of experiments
made with two intents — one, to endeavour to ascertain whether
there can be a complete arrest of vital action without the death of
the egg; the other to ascertain the changes which                take place in
those instances     in which,    during incubation,       the egg proves un
productive.
   The   eggs   used    were   chiefly those of the common fowl.            The

                   of Edinburgh, Session 1865-66.                          643
trials to which they were subjected were of three kinds — the air-
pump, the ice-house, and immersion in lime-water.
    Though the results obtained were not entirely negative, yet,
when reasoned on, and all the circumstances of the experiments
taken into account, they have not appeared so decisive as to allow
of the inference, in regard to arrested action, that that was
absolute  ; or as regards    the    changes,     that these, so many and
different, which take place in unproductive             eggs, admit of any
satisfactory explanation.
2. On the Absorption of Substances Iroin Solutions by
    Carbonaceous Matters, and the Growth thereby of Coal-
    Seams.     By William Skey, Analyst               to the      Geological
    Survey of New Zealand.                 Communicated           by James
    Hector, M.D., F.R.S.E., Director of the Geological Survey
    of New Zealand.
    Some time since, during the performance          of  a series  of analyses
of the Brown Coals of Otago, my attention was directed to the very
 large quantity of sulphur which several of them contained, even
 where the most careful     examination      failed   to detect more than
traces of sulphates or sulphides      in the composition       of the coal, a
singular fact which has been      before commented upon by Dr Percy
in his work on Metallurgy.
    After several unsuccessful efforts to discover the form in which
the excess of sulphur was present,       it occured to     me,  that possibly
the sulphur might be retained         to the coal in combination          with
hydrogen,    by a similar absorptive      power to that which charcoal
exercises over that gas.      I  therefore    tried whether      brown   coals
had the property      of absorbing    sulphuretted     hydrogen.      Finding
that brown coals did      possess   this power, the experiments were
extended over a variety of other substances in solution, and the
fact was established that, with certain modifications hereafter to
be described,   all mineralized    carbons, such as lignites, coal, and
graphite, possess    the power of absorbing        the same substances as
charcoal,   especially  those soluble    organic    matters that occur in
natural waters.

644                  Proceedings            of the Royal        Society
  The circumstance that these minerals                     are thus able to arrest and
retain organic substances, was so suggestive in relation to the origin
and physical characters of coal, that                I was led to make       this property
of coal   a special object       of study, and        as the course the investigation
took rendered        it very desirable to test the solubility of                    coal, this
subject was also carefully examined                     by me, and as the results of
these investigations         appeared to have some degree                    of    interest,   I
submitted them to the attention of Dr Hector, and with his advice
and assistance,      I   now endeavour to state them in a concise form.
  In   communicating         a detailed account           of the various experiments
employed      in these investigations,               the results arrived          at, and the
inferences they appear to justify,               I   have divided the whole subject
into three parts, the first of which is —
  I.   On Absorption as a Property of Lignite, Coal, and Graphite,
                      in common with Charcoal.
  a.   Absorption of Acids.
  6.   Absorption of Basic Substances.
  c.   Absorption of certain neutral Organic Substances.
  d.   Absorption of certain decomposed Organic Substances.
  e.   Combining quantities                 of bodies probably observed in                 their
          absorption.
  /.   Substitution effected in certain               cases.
                                            Summary.
   Sufficient     has been adduced by the experiments                     conducted by         me
to prove the existence                of   an absorptive power        in liguite,      coal, or
graphite for many organic and inorganic                        substances.        There is     no
doubt the list of such might have been almost indefinitely extended
if it had   been necessary        ;   but   I desired   rather to establish the general
fact of absorption, and to ascertain the principles which regulate                             it.
   So far as these results enable us to judge,                      it   would appear that
generally when any substance has but                      a    feeble solubility in water,
or when     it   has its affinities         for this liquid lowered or overpowered
by other agents, such substance                  will    bo    withdrawn from         solution
by contact with any of the foregoing bodies, lignite, coal, graphite,
or charcoal.         Those       substances which possess             basic or acid pro
perties especially,        are    subject      to absorption,       providing       such    pro

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1865-66.                                    645
perties are not too well defined.                    The substances of this class can
generally be abstracted from the absorbing body by the application
of a suitable acid or base, as the case may be.
   The fact of the absorption of acids being often facilitated by the
presence of stronger acids, and that of bases by the presence of
stronger       bases, the application               of these being indeed often           abso
lutely necessary to produce absorption, may perhaps be accounted
for by the greater affinity these stronger chemicals have for water.
   Thus the solvent powers of this liquid for the body we wish to
determine       to the coal, &c., is reduced, or altogether                      removed, and
that state most favourable for absorption obtains. If this is so, we
can perceive why sulphuric acid and the caustic alkalies are not
capable of being retained by coal or charcoal                     ;    their affinity for water
being       so intense that         it cannot       be overcome by absorptive            power
alone, and we are not in the possession of means to remove or lower
the affinity of these substances, as we have in the case of others.
  But it is particularly at this stage, in the investigation of                         assisted
absorption,      that, as      I    have before observed, we are enabled to trace
differences in the intensity of the absorptive power of charcoal and
coal   ;    the former      body being              able   to absorb       many    acids from
solution without that assistance from stronger acids required so
frequently by coals, the absorbing power of the charcoal being
superior to the affinity subsisting                   between the acid and the water,
while that of coal is generally inferior.                      However, there is this to
consider,       that when           we    have determined             the absorption    of any
acid to coal by the assistance of a stronger, we can                               remove the
latter without effecting the solution of the former to any consider
able extent.
                                         General Remarks.
  It       is worthy of remark, as indicating                 a   practical      application   of
these observations, that the absorption of arsenious acid by carbo
naceous substances would allow of its separation from solution for
analytical purposes            if   desirable   ;    arsenic acid, too, would no doubt
be also absorbed, being isomorphous                        with one which is        so, that   is,
phosphoric       acid.
  In       reference to the property of phosphoric                    acid, of being absorbed
by charcoal, &c.,         it   is    not improbable          that      the low    decolorising

646                     Proceedings     of the Royal         Society
power of animal           charcoal, when separated from the phosphate                    of
lime by means of hydrochloric acid, to what it should be theoreti
cally, may be partly due to the presence of this acid ; for if animal
charcoal,      which has been submitted           to three days' digesting               in
ordinary hydrochloric acid, be washed in water                     till nothing further
is removed, and be then placed in contact with ammonia for                        a   short
time, a slight but decided crystalline precipitate, soluble in acetic
acid, is obtained by adding chloride of ammonium,                        and sulphate    of
magnesia in excess of ammonia;                while,    if    water or weak hydro
chloric acid        was substituted for the ammonia, and suffered to remain
in contact with the charcoal for many hours, not the least indication
of phosphoric acid was obtained by the application of the above
test.    It   may be mentioned, the water employed contained a minute
quantity of carbonic acid, which would probably substitute itself
for a portion of the phosphoric acid absorbed to the charcoal, and
thus render its detection more difficult.
   The absortion of hydriodic acid by coal from acidulated                            solu
tions renders it very probable that, wherever any coal-bed is acid
from     the presence of the stronger           acid, and has a flow of water
through       it,   such bed will be charged with hydriodic acid in those
parts which first receive the underground                    flow   ;   and there, also,
we may reasonably expect to find an unusual                        proportion    of other
acids, such as phosphoric, arsenic, hydrosulphuric,                     and hydroarsenic
acids.
  The property of brown coals, &c., to absorb sulphuretted hydro
gen, affords  probable solution, as before shown, of the difficult
                    a
problem,      In     what form does the sulphur exist in those highly sul
phurized       coals,    which   are    comparatively        free from       either iron
pyrites, sulphuric acid, or sulphates?             That       it   does exist,   in com
bination  with hydrogen, to form sulphuretted hydrogen, received
confirmation from further experiments, which went to prove that
such coals evolved considerable             quantities of this gas when sub
jected to temperatures ranging from 212° to 300° Fahr.
   In regard to the action of decomposing organic matters upon
sulphates furnishing the gas, we have only to take iuto considera
tion the general absorptive power of coal to explain the frequent
association of sulphuretted            hydrogen with it.
   It   may be stated that many of the older coals, as also samples

                               of Edinburgh,       Session 1865-66.                         647
of    graphite from England, and from the province of Nelson, New
Zealand, gave indications of the presence of sulphuretted hydrogen
in the vapour evolved from them hy the application of a heat not
exceeding               300°   Fahr.
     In      reference to the absorption of gas, it would                   appear that at
least carbonic acid               does not owe its absorption to the porous nature
of    the coal alone; for substances quite as porous, such as clay,
brick,        blotting-paper,           and wood, when         dried at 212° Fahr., and
placed in carbonic                acid gas, did not exhibit any power of absorp
tion. A piece of 'well-washed hydrate of alumina, however, was
found to be capable of absorbing ten volumes of this gas when
dried at           212°     Fahr., and nearly as much when exposed to a red
heat     ;   but as       this substance in solution has decided basic properties,
it is probable the absorption in this instance is due to the exercise
of these.
                  II.    Partial Solubility    a   Property   possessed by Coal.
              a.    Partial Solubility of Brown Coal.
              b.    Partial Solubility of Bituminous Coal.
                                        Summary of Results.
     From the experiments                 conducted     under this department,         it   was
found that a lignite of good average quality, compact and lustrous,
is soluble in pure water to a considerable extent, — about l-20th per
cent, being thus soluble, — and that even in the case of a hard,
compact            bituminous          coal of excellent      quality, belonging to the
carboniferous              formation,    this also has   a small   but very appreciable
solubility in the same liquid. Allowing this last to be an excep
tional case however, it might be argued (if, indeed, lignites are
in   a   transitional state between                dead vegetable matter      and mineral
coal) that the solubility of the lignite will be continued far into
the coal proper; but the degree of it will gradually diminish until
scarcely           any method of testing            would discover    it,   or until   it    be
finally and completely                   lost in those members of the coal series
farthest removed from the commencement.

    Carbonaceous Deposits exercises upon the Growth of Coal Seams.
   (1) . Recapitulation      of those facts already stated affecting the
question at issue.
   (2) . Application of these phenomena.
   In applying       these various phenomena to explain how certain of
the properties of the coal have been attained, the subject             will be
treated in the following manner.            The first of the division  is —
   a. Absorption      applied to increase the Compactness of Coal-Seams.
   b.  Absorption      applied to increase their thickness.       Two objec
         tions answered.
   c. Absorption applied to convert Carbonaceous Clays into Bitu
         minous Shale or impure Coal.
   d.  The lustre, hardness, and coherence of Coal possibly due to
         the exercise of its absorptive power and its partial solu
         bility in water.
   e. The absorptive power and solubility of Coal applied to in
         crease the structural and chemical differences of adjoining
         parts.
                               Summary    of Facts.
   In summing up the several parts            we find  the absorptive    power
of the coal enables it to arrest those organic          matters contained in
common water, and a continual supply of such being kept up by
the flow of the water down to the level of the sea, carrying the
necessary material,        we   may have     the compactness of the same
largely augmented        ; all losses entailed by decomposition made      good
by interior absorption, or by a surface absorption, and thus these
matters may be applied to build up the seam to a greater thickness.
In the    one case we require no miraculous         interposition  of pressure
to remove the vesicularity which decomposition             entails in the in
durated mass      ;  and in the other, in surface absorption, we reduce
the difficulty we have in accounting for the remarkable thickness
which    has been attained by certain coal-seams.
   These additions would be singularly free from earthy impurities
of any kind, and therefore, no matter how great a thickness the

                      of Edinburgh,           Session 1865-66.                               649
seam ultimately attained                by this means may be, we should find                   it
comparatively pure and uniform in composition.                              The whole roof
of   superincumbent            material, however great its thickness might be,
would      be   lifted up in detail, scarcely            a particle would       be    left   be
hind to attest the        act.
     In
      part (c) we find how this absorptive power may be applied
,with some degree of probability to account for the production of
certain bituminous shales and impure coals, characterised by their
homogeneity,   and their poverty in vegetable structures.     The
,whole process is nearly a repetition of what is supposed to occur
in the case of coal itself, the only difference being, that in one case
the absorbing substance                is thinly dispersed through a quantity of
earthy matters, while in the other it is in a concrete form.
     In    part (d)   I    have       attempted    to show         in what manner            the
partial solubility of coal, together with its absorptive power, may
 have affected its physical character.
     It   has been    supposed that the whole seam has been                         repeatedly
turned over by these means, and each time reduced by the separa
 tion of portions         of   it,   principally in the form of oxygenated com
 pounds    :    the losses so incurred, however, being abundantly                        made
 up by introduced         substances.        It   is,   in fact,   a   continual re-solution
and re-deposit.
     Now, all    these processes        going on at an exceedingly slow rate,                 we
are quite certain,judging from analogous cases, that ultimately the
product so attained will cohere in all its parts, and be possessed of
the utmost hardness and the highest degree of lustre of which its
 constitution     admits.
     In   the last part (e),     I     have used these properties of coal to in
crease the differences           in adjoining parts of the              seam.   To assist in
 this, and to give        a     greater completeness to the work,               I   have gone
 further back in the history of coal, and traced supposititious origin
                                                                   a
 for the commencement of these differences, using the suggestion of
 Bischoff, relating to the precipitation of the organic substances from
 water in the first instance.    Thus     had horizontal cleavage and
                                                  I
planes of greatest change readily afforded me                      ;    and to increase the
differences      so started          and so directed,    I    had only to suppose that
 the rates of absorption               for that part most decomposed, and that
part least so, are unequal.

 650                Proceedings      of the Royal       Society
    Thus every characteristic        quality which distinguishes          mineral
 coal from ordinary decomposed vegetable substances has now been
 considered, and,     I think,  provided    for in the exercise of these its
 newly discovered properties of absorption and solubility.
    Whether a slight elevation of temperature is necessary or no to
 assist in educing those members of the coal series, very far removed
 from the primary material,       it is certain it would greatly facilitate
 the mineralisation       of these deposits, but in either case it is the
 presence of water which, besides initiating            the commencement       of
 the required changes, allows of them being carried to the farthest
point, by bringing the particles of the solid substances within reach
 of each other's affinities, thus determining the production              of new
combinations      more insoluble, more carbonaceous, and more easily
absorbed    ; and these being deposited as they were formed slowly, the
hardness, coherence, and compactness of the deposit are ensured.
    IV.   Popular    theory, explaining   the  Physical Properties of Coal
                                   considered.
    As  I  have purposely avoided        all along any reference to other
theories respecting the formation of coal, in order that no external
influence should be brought to secure favour for the views here
propounded      from prematurely      showing       up their deficiencies, pre
ferring rather that they should stand thus long on their own merits
uncontrasted with those of others.             I   hope now to be allowed to
state a few objections      —objections     so obvious     and so serious that
they   will have frequently occurred to the mind of the inquirer.
    The principal agencies hitherto supposed to be involved in the
formation of coal are decomposition, pressure, and heat. In regard
to decomposition,       important   and indeed essential        as it is to the
formation     of coal, it is still possible to overstate its influence.
Taken by itself, it is obvious it cannot increase the hardness of
coal.    It is the property of decay rather to reduce than to jcrease
the hardness       of minerals, the most compact of which are thus
modified, and especially should this be apparent in coal where it
involves a positive loss of substance.             This is well exemplified in
 the case of wood which        has suffered the
                                                      " dry rot, here, from the
absence of water in sufficient        quantity, there has been        no recom-
           "
 position     of the decomposed matters          ;  hence even the colour      is

                     of Edinburgh,     Session 1865-66.                    651
 unchanged, though the wood is exceedingly             reduced in compact
 ness.     Nor even with the aid of pressure can we do more than
 increase the density; we bring their particles         nearer together, but
we do not affect the character       of the particles themselves ; if pres
 sure could perform this, why should it not have been equally
effective for the induration of clays or other soft hydrous minerals,
which in certain states bear considerable           resemblance   to lignite,
 many of these having been subjected to pressure as great, or even
 far greater ?
    It  is to a reconstruction   of the residue from decomposition into
 new, more insoluble, and more permanent combination,               that any
 great physical differences      should   be due, and to     this only; this
 cannot, however, be effected while the particles         of the solid vege
 table matters are    unable to move to each other's affinities while
 their position    is fixed  by cohesion    ;  they must be brought        into
 renewed chemical       contact  before they can enter into those com
 binations which give to coal qualities we have to account for.
    If   now we seek the assistance of an elevation          of temperature
 sufficient to fuse or volatilize portions of the coal, so as to gain in
this renewed chemical contact,        so necessary    for recomposition, we
shall find that, although       we may effect     this, the results   are   not
altogether of the kind we want.
    Suppose we attempt to go no further than partial fusion, although
we should      certainly indurate its particles considerably, and give
them some      degree of lustre, and also effect favourable recomposition
in the substance in regard to its chemical composition, we should
certainly obliterate that laminated appearance coal often presents,
and render the whole perfectly homogeneous, both in its physical
character     and chemical    composition    ; and we should further most
likely destroy the distinctions of those boundaries which separate
the coal-seam from above or below, and also change their uniformity
of direction.     But, in all probability, in attempting the fusion only,
we could not avoid decomposing a portion of the coal into gas, and
this being mechanically retained by the semifluid mass, would render
it porous throughout ; and thus, although we might gain consider
ably in some of the properties of coal, such as those of hardness,
lustre,    coherence,   we  should lose in compactness — the vesicular
appearance such a product would           present would neutralise      all we

652                  Proceedings     of the Royal Society
 have gained, and give it an appearance quite foreign                 to that of
coal. But to what extent this porosity would be modified by the
 application of an immense pressure during the heating process we
 do not know     ; this, however, is almost certain, that      if it did succeed
in preserving or giving to the coal a more mineral                appearance, it
could but partially reduce its vesicularity, and never so much but
that it would readily be discerned         — the   increase of hardness sup
 posed    to follow by this process would           only help to impede the
effect of pressure, and preserve to the vesicules their exact shape
 and size.
    But in order to      escape  this,  it may    be argued    that the gas in
these pores has since been        substituted     by other matters in a state
of fusion, or by condensed oils, &c.            If,  however, such had been
 really the case, we should surely have been able to observe indica
tions of it in the amygdaloidal state of the coal so found, since we
could scarcely have given         us   the same      characters   to substances
whose chemical        composition   and manner        of formation   are   so    dif
 ferent; this appearance would be especially manifested at the
junction of those bands in the coal before alluded to ; in the place
of the divisional places being          as now perfect, there would         be in
numerable      interruptions from some of the             geodes    occupying       a
position in both seams.        That bands of        a more recent     date have
obliterated the amygdaloidal       appearance of the coal is too improbable
 to need any comment.
    It  would therefore appear, that though the hardness of coal may
be increased, even      into that of coke, by heat, the coal thus obtained
would be rendered proportionately            lighter and more porous         ;  and
that heat could induce the laminated appearance of coal, or favour
its development, when begun, is very improbable, its effect would
rather be to obliterate any previous lamination, and give to the coal
 a homogeneous appearance.
    But besides these objections         against the supposition       that high
temperature       has been concerned       in the production       of coal from
organic matters, there are others — the non-necessity of such for the
production     of these chemical differences we observe between them                 ;
for that there is no absolute necessity for this may be gathered
from the heterogeneous nature of most samples of coals.                   In     the
case   of the Newcastle coal, the difference in the parts, great          as   it is.

                    of Edinburgh,       Session 1865-66.                        653
is   not owing to any superior heat applied for the production of the
more carbonaceous substance ; for how, indeed, could superior heat
be applied    to these parts alone      ?   Why, therefore, should not the
bituminous coal        be  itself produced from brown coal without the
aid of any increase of temperature           over that     which     has obtained
in its formation ? there being no greater chemical difference between
these than there is found to be between the bituminous                   coal and
the fibrous anthracite.
     But, besides the internal evidence afforded by coal itself that
substances very rich in carbon can be eliminated at low tempera
tures,   we have the      authority of Bischoff for asserting, that for the
elimination of       a   substance still further removed from organic
matter (graphite) high temperatures are not necessary.
     On the whole,       it would therefore     appear     there    is indeed no
absolute necessity to provide any considerable elevation of tempera
ture to bring about the chemical change required to convert decom
posed organic       matter into substances resembling            anthracite   ; and
further, it would also appear that hardness gained in such               a manner
 would render the product porous, or,       if these  pores were subsequently
 filled, the anthracite     would appear amygdaloidal.
     Thus  we  have to rely upon the solvent           powers of water as the
only means by which recomposilion can be effected, — as the only
 agency which can modify these vegetable substances in the manner
 we would    wish, and which         not only favours their decomposition,
 but allows of their recomposition         and deposit as       a hard, compact,
coherent, and lustrous mineral.
     In conclusion,    I have   to apologise for the incompleteness of these
 investigations   ;   nothing but my         inability    to prosecute      further
 researches for some time, owing to the removal of the laboratory
 to a distant part of the colony,          and the consequent          suspense of
 analytical operations, induces me to forward them in this state.
      There was one part      of the subject, especially,    I was very    anxious
 to examine further — that treating upon substitution — for it was
 apparent, if it could be ascertained whether or no gases are able to
  substitute each other, some further light would be shown upon the
  manner in which these absorptions are effected, since, in the absence
 of solvents, there would        be fewer chemical     affinities to interfere.

654                  Proceedings       of the Royal    Society
    But it  was   more particularly in reference to the manner of the
 formation of coal as connected with its property of absorption that
 I was the   most desirous to add to these investigations,         and especially
as to the precise action        carbonic acid exercises during the absorp
tion of decomposing organic matters. As to whether, in any case,
these matters are able to substitute this acid when it has been pre
viously absorbed to the coal.
    If not  anticipated, however, with permission,           I intend  communi
cating further upon these subjects, when the results of certain pro
jected experiments relative to this are ascertained.
3. (1.)   Description of Erpetoichthys, a new Genua of Ganoid
      Fish, from Old Calabar, Western Africa ; forming an
      addition to the      Family Polypterini.           By John Alexander
      Smith, M.D., F.K.C.P.E.               (Specimens of the fish were
      exhibited.)
    In  the beginning of January            1865, the author      received from
the Rev. Alexander Robb, Old Calabar,                 a package     of specimens
of natural history preserved in spirits.              Among these were        two
small ganoid       fish.    They were, however, imperfect, having            been
torn across     near the anal region, and their caudal extremities           were
wanting.      The characters of the fish could not, therefore, be            com
pletely determined.          The author, however, exhibited them at a
meeting of the Royal Physical Society, on the 22d March 1865, and
stated that they were allied to the genus Polypterus ; but from
various    differences    in character, to       be afterwards     detailed,  and
especially    the     great   relative   length of     their bodies,     and   the
apparently total absence of ventral           fins, he would place them pro
visionally in     a new genus,       which, from their general aspect         and
form,    he designated       Erpetoichthys,     the  reptile   or serpent fish    ;
and the species, from the locality where             it was found, he      named
E. Calalaricus.
   Since that time the author had received perfect specimens from
Old Calabar, and found that the accuracy of his previous conclu
sions were confirmed.
   The fish    is got in the fresh-water      streamlets which run into the

                              of Edinburgh,         Session 1865-66.                                655
main rivers              or creeks of the great Calabar river, and in the pools
 of the marshy lands.                  It    is occasionally        sold in the markets, and
eaten by some of the natives.                       Its native name is U-nyang, which
 the Rev.             Mr Robb explains, by suggesting that it may                     be derived
 from a verb signifying                  to struggle or scuffle for the possession of
 a thing, and he therefore supposes it to mean the struggler, or,
 using a Scottish word as more appropriate, the " wambler," — the
 name        being          probably     given          it,
                                                of the apparent
                                                   to          on account
 struggling, wriggling, or undulating movements of its elongated
 body, as         it   swims in the water or mud of the river.
      Summary of characters of the genus Calamoichthys* and its rela
 tion to the genus Polypterus —               :
    Gjsnds Calamoichthys. — Head, small, depressed above, somewhat
 oval in shape (rounded and narrow in front, expands laterally
 behind orbits, and contracts again at the back part, towards neck).
 Suboperculum wanting.      (No small plates below preoperculum.)
Body, much elongated                   ;   anguiform          (cylindrical for about half its
 length,                 gradually more compressed laterally, and
                  then becoming
tapering slightly towards its caudal extremity). Caudal extremity,
short, tapering               rapidly.      Caudal Fin, rounded           ;    homocercal      ;    fin-
rays, hard.              {Scales, osseous,       rhombic,       sculptured.)      Fins, small —
Pectorals,            obtusely lobate, fin-rays soft            ;   Dorsal finlets,   numerous,
separate          ;   Anal    (ialW«lwMM44iiN«ataHilf),                        in male large, in
female small            ;    fin-rays hard   ;    Ventrals, wanting.
     The last character             is     rather an important one, as this fish thus
appears to be the only living ganoid yet known which has no ventral
fins. Van der Hoeven, in his " Handbook of Zoology," gives the
presence of ventral fins as one of the characters of his great Section
III.     of the Class Pisces, the Ganolepidoti   and older naturalists,
                                                                    ;
as      Cuvier, place the ganoids, for     similar reason, among the
                                                         a

fore necessitate  change in this character of the whole section.

corresponding name to Erpttoichthyt had been already used in Ichthyology                               ;
and, accordingly, he now changes the designation to Calamoichthys (Calamos
and ichthys), which still bears    relation to the cylindrical shape of the

 subsequent contraction           towards neck); its gently swelling outlines
gradually expand,         and run         backwards     into those of   the   body.
 Suboperculum       present     ;    several small plates below preoperculum.
Body,     relatively much shorter, generally tapering gradually from
behind region of pectoral fins, and becoming more compressed
laterally, towards its caudal extremity.                 Caudal extremity, longer.
Scales,      generally   smooth(?).           Fins, larger — Pectorals, fin-rays,
osseous    ;  Anal, apparently alike in size in male and female             ; Ven-
trals, present.
    The genus Calamoichthys agrees, however, with Polypterus, in
the general character of its numerous dorsal finlets; lobate pec
torals  ;  two nasal cirri    ;    a spiracle    on each side of the head above    ;
and a large flat branchiostegous              ray or jugular plate, on each side
of the mesian line below           ;  and also in the hard, osseous, rhomboidal-
shaped ganoid scales, arranged                in rows, running obliquely back
wards   ;   and in the tapering caudal extremity of the body.
    The new genus belongs, therefore, to the same family as Polyp
terus, and would accordingly fall to be placed next to it in the
Family of the Polypterini : —

study     of   a  species of the genus Polypterus.               Dr Traquair    has
accordingly      prepared   a    detailed account of its anatomy.

(2.) InternalStructure of Calamoichthys Calabaricus (J. A.
    Smith.)  By E. H. Traquair, M.D., Demonstrator of
    Anatomy in the University of Edinburgh.
  On dissecting those specimens of Calamoichthys, entrusted to the
author by Dr Smith, the greatest similarity was found to exist
between their internal organisation           and that of Polypterus               ; the
chief differences being dependent on the great elongation of the
body of the former fish, while the abdominal cavity extends propor
tionately still further back towards the caudal extremity than is the
case even in the genus last mentioned.
   The vertebra resemble in construction                 of Polyp
                                                         exactly    'those
terus,    but are very much increased in number, amounting, in the
specimen which        was used for the preparation             of the skeleton, to
110, the first of which has no body, consisting merely of neura-
pophyses, spinous process, and a pair of ribs.  These latter form
the first of the series of well-developed           upper ribs, which extend
in the horizontal intermuscular           septum, as far back as the ninety-
eighth vertebra.        But the lower series of ribs           are very deficient      in
development  in comparison with those in Polypterus, where the
whole series of abdominal vertebrae, except the first, is furnished
with those appendages, which posteriorly                   attain     a considerable
length.     In   Calamoichthys, on the other hand, those lower ribs are
very minute, and no trace of them was found in advance of the
sixtieth vertebra. The number of abdominal vertebraj   in the                is,
specimen alluded        to,    100, of caudal, 10   ;    showing      the very great
proportional       elongation    of the abdominal         and shortening           of the
caudal     region.     The vertebral column         projects       beyond        the last
caudal vertebra, as     a     notochordal continuation         or " Urostyle," con
cealed among the rays of the caudal fiu.         The bones supporting
the fins agree in their general conformation with those in Polypterus,
— there being, however,       less ossified state of the radius, ulna,
                                  a
and carpus, while the pelvic bones, along with the ventral fins, are
completely absent.        The first dorsal finlet         is   placed opposite the
forty-ninth vertebra.
  As regards the form and arrangement of the bones of the cranium
and face, the most complete correspondence    found with those of
                                                          is
Polypterus,    a   space being found, however, below the preoperculum,
which, in various species of Polypterus,            is   defended by         a   variable

658                   Proceedings       of  the  Royal Society
number        of bony plates.          The suboperculum is also completely
absent.        The arrangement of the mucus canals on the head is
similar to that in Polypterus.
    The arrangement of the muscular system corresponds in the two
genera.        In Calamoichthys, owing to the great increase of the num
ber of vertebrae,        the number of transverse         segments of the great
body muscle is also much larger.                The muscular layer along the
belly is very thin.
    Viscera. — The oesophagus           dilates into a flask-shaped      stomach,
which terminates behind in              a cul de sac.   From the interior part
of the stomach, and close behind the entrance of the oesophagus,
issues the intestine, which, passing first slightly forwards, makes
almost      immediately      a turn    on itself, and then     proceeds straight
back to the anus.           A  small    coecal  appendage, with the apex di
rected forwards, is seen          in connection with the intestine shortly
after its backward flexure          ;  and a little farther down, between this
and the anus, a spiral valve of about five turns is developed in the
interior.       The liver    was   in none of the specimens examined very
voluminous, but much elongated, being continued as a narrow stripe
 the whole length of the abdominal cavity.                   The gall-bladder is
 distinct, and opens into the intestine immediately              after its flexure,
 and in front of the coecum.
    The heart is conformed, as in Polypterus, with muscular bulbus
 arteriosus, which is furnished internally with numerous valves of
 unequal      size.    The branchial artery gives off first a large lateral
 branch on each        side, which divides into three for the three posterior
 gills  ; the trunk then bifurcates, giving off a branch for the anterior
 gill of each side.        As in Polypterus, the posterior gill has only        one
  row of leaflets, and the cleft behind it is wanting.              No trace of a
  " Pseudobranchia" was found,              an  organ likewise absent in Polyp
 terus.      The spleen is very long and slender, lying closely along
  the great air-bladder.         The air-bladders are two in number, open
  ing by a common orifice into the lower aspect of the throat,
  behind      the   gill-clefts.      That of the left side is small,         being
  only 2|ths inches in length on a fish of 10 inches; it is closely
  adherent to the side of the oesophagus and commencement of
  the stomach.         That of the other side measures 8| inches on the
  same fish, and extends along the whole length of the abdominal

cavity,   lying closely    along  the  under    surface     of the vertebral
column.
    Like the rest of the abdominal        organs in general, the kidneys
are very slender and elongated ; each consists         of  a number    of little
lobules, which lie in the concavities on the under            surfaces of the
vertebral bodies.     The excretory duct or ureter lies along the outer
border of the organ, and passes straight backwards to unite with
the genital duct, and, with its fellow of the opposite side, at the
urogenital pore.     The ovaries and oviducts correspond exactly with
Muller's description of these organs in Potypterus (Trans. Berlin
Acad. 1844). Each ovary is in the form of a flattened plate, sus
pended in front of the posterior part of the kidney by a mesentery,
is solid, and consists of a stroma imbedding          ova of all sizes, up to
,iifth of an inch in diameter.        The oviduct, proceeding          forwards
from the urogenital      pore as a pretty wide tube, crosses      beneath the
ovarian     mesentery,   and opens into the peritoneal         cavity,   on the
 outer side of the gland, and closely above its lower extremity.             The
 ovaries are not symmetrical       in position,   one being in advance of
 the other, so that also one oviduct is longer.        In   a female measur
 ing 8f ths inches, the right ovary was     lJ  inch in length, its anterior
 extremity being placed 4|ths inches from the top of the snout, and
 the length of the oviduct ljths inch, while the left measured             If ths
 inch, was situated at its anterior     extremity 5|ths inches from the
 tip of the snout, and having a duct of l^ths inch. The testes are
 very minute,     and situated   very far forwards,      each   being a small
 oval body    ^ths inch in length, in    a male   of 10 inches    ; and in the
 same specimen the right one was situated                 and the left 2-JJths
 inches    back from the tip of the snout.       A  very minute duct runs
  backwards parallel with and close to the ureter, which it joins near
  the urogenital   pore.
     On opening a number of specimens, it was found that all those
  with  a large anal fin were males,  while those in which that organ was
  small were females.      The females   are, however, to be     distinguished
  from the males by another character, namely, the much larger size of
  the urogenital pore, which is situated immediately behind the anus.
